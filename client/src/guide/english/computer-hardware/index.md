## Computer Hardware

In this section, we explore the various hardware components of modern computers. 

## Parts of a Personal Computer

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
A Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.

### Memory (RAM)
Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage which stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.
