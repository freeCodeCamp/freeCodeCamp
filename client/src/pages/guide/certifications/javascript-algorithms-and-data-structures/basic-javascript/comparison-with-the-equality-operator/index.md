## Comparison with the equality operator


### Problem explanation:
_Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return "Equal" when `val` is equivalent to 12._

#### Hint 1
Remember that _equality is different from assignment (`=`), which assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable in the left._<sup>1</sup>

## Spoiler alert!

**Solution ahead!**

## Basic code solution:

```javascript

function testEqual(val) {
  if (val == 12) { // Change this line
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not equal";
}
// Change this value to test
testEqual(10);

```

### Code explanation
The function first evaluates `if` the condition `(val == 12)` evaluates to `true`. If it does, it returns the statement between the curly braces ("Equal"). If it doesn't, it returns the next `return` statement outside them ("Not equal").
