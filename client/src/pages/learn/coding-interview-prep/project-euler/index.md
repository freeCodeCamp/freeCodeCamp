## Introduction to the Project Euler Problems

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) (pronounced Oiler) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems meant to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational manner.

> The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is, by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that allows you to undertake a previously inaccessible problem.
>
> Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.
