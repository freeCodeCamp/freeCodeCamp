## Introduction to the Coding Interview Take Home Projects

Programming interviews have always been stressful. One of the solutions is giving the applicant a take home project to be completed outside of the interview. These types of interviews usually require a lot of work, but they're a great way for employers to see how you might perform on the job.

The interview after the project submission could be a discussion about the applicant’s design decisions, scalability, and what the applicant might have done differently. This approach is more effective when the applicant doesn’t have a lot of publicly available past projects.

In this section you get the chance to work on many Take Home Projects like:

- Show Local Weather using Weather API and Geolocation
- Build a Wikipedia Viewer using Wikipedia's API
- Build a Pinterest Clone using Masonry.js library
  and many more!

By the end of this section, you will have plenty of Take Home Projects under your belt. This will boost your confidence and prepare you for Take Home Project Interviews.
