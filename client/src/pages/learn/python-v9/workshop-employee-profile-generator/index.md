## Introduction to the Build an Employee Profile Generator

In this workshop, you will learn the fundamentals of string manipulation in Python by building a tool that generates formatted employee badges and analyzes employee codes.

You will start by combining simple strings and move on to more advanced techniques used in real-world data processing.

You will learn how to:

- Combine strings using **Concatenation** (`+`).
- Append text to variables using **Augmented Assignment** (`+=`).
- Handle incompatible data types using **Type Conversion** (`str()`).
- Create clean, readable templates using **f-strings**.
- Extract specific data (like department codes) using **String Slicing**.

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to take raw employee data and transform it into professional, formatted output.
