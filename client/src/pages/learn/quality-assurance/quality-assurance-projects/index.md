## Introduction to the Quality Assurance Projects

Now itâ€™s time to put your newly learned skills to work! By working on these projects, you will have the opportunity of applying all the skills, principles, and concepts from the Quality Assurance sections.

In this section you get the chance to:

- Build a Metric-Imperial Converter
- Build an Issue Tracker
- Build a Personal Library
- Sudoku Solver
- American British Translator

When you are done, you will have plenty of Quality Assurance projects under your belt along with a certification that you can show off to friends, family, and employers.
