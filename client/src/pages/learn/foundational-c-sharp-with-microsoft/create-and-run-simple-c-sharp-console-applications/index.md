## Introduction to Create and Run Simple C# Console Applications

Creating and running simple C# console applications is the first step in learning how to develop with C#. These foundational skills are essential for understanding the basics of the language and building more complex applications in the future.

The goal of this project is to master the creation and execution of basic C# console applications. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, write simple C# programs, compile them, and run them from the console. This includes understanding the structure of a C# program, using variables, and performing basic input and output operations.

Proficiency in creating and running simple C# console applications is a crucial starting point for any aspiring C# developer. Throughout this project, you'll engage in hands-on exercises that guide you through writing, compiling, and executing your code. By the end, you'll have the confidence to create basic C# programs, setting a solid foundation for more advanced development.
