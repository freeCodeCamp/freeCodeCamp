## Introduction to Write your First Code Using C#

Writing your first code using C# is an exciting milestone in your programming journey. C# is a powerful and versatile language used for a variety of applications, from desktop software to web services. By learning the basics of C# and writing your first program, you'll set a strong foundation for further exploration and development in this language.

The goal of this project is to guide you through writing your first C# console application. You'll learn how to set up your development environment, write a simple program, compile it, and run it. This includes understanding the basic structure of a C# program, using the Main method, and performing basic input and output operations.

Proficiency in writing your first C# code is crucial for building confidence and gaining familiarity with the language. Throughout this project, you'll engage in hands-on exercises that introduce you to fundamental programming concepts, such as variables, data types, and control flow. By the end, you'll have written and executed your first C# program, setting the stage for more complex projects.
