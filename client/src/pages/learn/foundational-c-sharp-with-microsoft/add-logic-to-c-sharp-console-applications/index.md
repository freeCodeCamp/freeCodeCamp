## Introduction to Add Logic to C# Console Applications

Adding logic to C# console applications is a key step in transitioning from simple programs to more sophisticated, functional applications. Logic implementation allows you to control the flow of your program, make decisions, and respond dynamically to user input, thereby creating more interactive and robust applications.

The goal of this project is to master the integration of logical structures in your C# console applications. You'll learn how to implement conditional statements, loops, and exception handling, which are essential for controlling the behavior of your program based on various conditions and inputs.

Proficiency in adding logic to C# applications is crucial for any developer aiming to create effective and user-friendly software. Throughout this project, you'll engage in hands-on exercises that simulate real-world scenarios, from creating interactive menus to handling user errors gracefully. By the end, you'll have the skills to enhance your console applications with advanced logic, making them more versatile and responsive.
