## Introduction to Create Methods in C# Console Applications

Creating methods in C# console applications is a fundamental skill that enables you to write organized, reusable, and modular code. Methods allow you to encapsulate functionality, making your programs easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

The goal of this project is to master the creation and usage of methods in your C# console applications. You'll learn how to define methods, pass parameters, return values, and understand the scope of variables. This includes creating both void methods that perform actions and value-returning methods that compute and return results.

Proficiency in creating methods is essential for any C# developer aiming to write clean and efficient code. Throughout this project, you'll engage in hands-on exercises that simulate real-world scenarios, such as breaking down complex problems into manageable functions, implementing utility methods, and enhancing code readability. By the end, you'll have the skills to create and use methods effectively, making your console applications more robust and maintainable.
