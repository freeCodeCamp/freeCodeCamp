## Introduction to Scientific Computing with Python

The Scientific Computing with Python curriculum will equip you with the fundamentals of scientific computing, including data structures and algorithms to solidify your understanding of Python programming.

Among the projects, you'll learn Python list comprehensions by building a case converter program, and master string manipulation by developing a cipher. The course also includes lessons on working with numbers and strings through implementing the Luhn algorithm and using lambda functions by creating an expense tracker.
The curriculum also covers algorithm design with the shortest path algorithm, recursion with the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, and data structures with the merge sort algorithm.

In addition to core programming skills, the curriculum emphasizes real-world applications of scientific computing. You'll learn about numerical methods, building a vector space and simulating projectile motion, making you proficient in scientific and analytical programming.
