## Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Password Generator

Regular expressions are a powerful tool used for matching patterns within strings. They are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, primarily used for string searching and validation.

In this project, you'll learn the basics of regular expressions. You'll also learn how to import modules from the Python standard library. A Python module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.

You'll build your password generator that sets complexity requirements using regular expressions. Python's random module is used to generate random numbers within a range. It is also used to shuffle the characters in a string. The strings module is used to get a string containing all ASCII characters, both lowercase and uppercase, digits and punctuation.

With the help of these modules, you'll also see how to create a password with specific strength requirements, such as including numbers, special characters, uppercase letters, and lowercase letters, all using regex patterns.
