## Learn Data Structures by Building the Merge Sort Algorithm

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that allow you to organize and store data efficiently. Different data structures are used for various types of applications, each optimized for specific tasks.

The Merge Sort Algorithm is a sorting algorithm based on the divide and conquer principle, which involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem independently, and then combining the solutions to solve the original problem.

In this project, you'll learn how to interact with data structures by sorting a list of random numbers using the Merge Sort Algorithm. The Merge Sort Algorithm recursively divides the list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains a single element, then merges the sublists back together in the correct order.
