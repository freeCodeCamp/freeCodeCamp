## Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algorithm

A shortest path algorithm finds the minimum distance between two nodes in a graph, ensuring the most efficient route. For finding the shortest path, lists and dictionaries are an excellent choice.

In the process of finding the shortest path, lists store sequences of nodes or edges. They facilitate easy indexing and iteration, making them ideal for managing collections of graph elements, such as unvisited nodes or adjacent nodes.

Dictionaries enhance the algorithm's efficiency with fast lookups. They can map nodes to their shortest path distances or store adjacency lists, allowing quick access and updates.

You'll also come across tuples that are useful for handling immutable data, representing edges or (node, distance) pairs that shouldn't change. Their immutability ensures data consistency throughout the algorithm's execution, contributing to a reliable implementation.
