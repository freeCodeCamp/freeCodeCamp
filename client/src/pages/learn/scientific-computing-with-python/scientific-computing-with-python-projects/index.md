## Introduction to the Scientific Computing with Python Projects

Time to put your Python skills to the test! By completing these projects, you will demonstrate that you have a good foundational knowledge of Python.

We are working to finish up the interactive Python instructional content. For now, here are some videos on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel that will teach you everything you need to know to complete these projects:

- [Python for Everybody Video Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-for-everybody/) (14 hours)
- [Learn Python Video Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-python-basics-in-depth-video-course/) (4 hours)

In this section you will develop the following projects:

- Arithmetic Formatter
- Time Calculator
- Budget App
- Polygon Area Calculator
- Probability Calculator

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514) method if you get stuck.
