## Learn How to Work with Numbers and Strings by Implementing the Luhn Algorithm

Algorithms can be employed to see the validity of the given data. One such algorithm is the Luhn Algorithm, which is used to validate a variety of identification numbers, particularly credit card numbers. It is a simple formula that helps in detecting accidental errors in the sequences of numbers by verifying the final digit, known as the check digit, which is determined by a specific calculation on the other digits.

In this project, you will verify a given credit card number using the Luhn Algorithm. By building this project, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation. You will also perform operations like reversing strings and handling character replacements.
