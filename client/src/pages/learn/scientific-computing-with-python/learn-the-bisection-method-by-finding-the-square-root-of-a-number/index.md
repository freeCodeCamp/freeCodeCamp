## Learn the Bisection Method by Finding the Square Root of a Number

Numerical analysis is essential in scientific computing for solving equations where analytical solutions are not feasible.

This project introduces numerical analysis by finding the square root of a number using the bisection method- a straightforward iterative technique to approximate solutions to problems that are difficult to solve analytically.

By setting an initial range and iteratively narrowing it down based on midpoints, the code converges on an approximate value for the square root. This approach emphasizes the importance of iterative methods and tolerance levels in numerical computations.

Core concepts taught in this project include the implementation of the bisection method, handling edge cases, and understanding convergence criteria in numerical algorithms.
