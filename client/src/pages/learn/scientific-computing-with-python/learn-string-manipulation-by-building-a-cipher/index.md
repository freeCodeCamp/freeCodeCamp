## Learn String Manipulation by Building a Cipher

A cipher is a method or algorithm for performing encryption or decryption—a process that converts plain text into coded text (ciphertext) and vice versa. The purpose of a cipher is to secure information by making it unreadable to unauthorized users while allowing intended recipients to decode and access the original message.

The project involves writing functions to encrypt and decrypt messages using a custom key. By cycling through the key and shifting characters accordingly, the Vigenère cipher illustrates how text can be transformed into a coded form and then back to its original state. This hands-on approach helps in understanding the principles of encryption and decryption.

Through this project, you will learn key concepts such as string indexing, character manipulation, and the use of modular arithmetic for encoding and decoding text.
