## Learn Tree Traversal by Building a Binary Search Tree

In computer science, "trees" refer to a data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node contains a value and may have zero or more child nodes. Tree traversal is a process of visiting each node in a tree data structure exactly once.

Understanding how to create and traverse trees is essential for working with hierarchical data structures. Tree-like data structures organize data for sorting, quick search, insertion, and deletion operations.

In this project, you will gain a deep understanding of how binary search trees function and how traversal techniques can be applied to efficiently access and manipulate tree data structures.
