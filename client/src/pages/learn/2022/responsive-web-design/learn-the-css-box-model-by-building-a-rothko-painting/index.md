## Introduction to the Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting

The CSS Box Model is fundamental to web design, defining how elements are displayed and interact with one another. By mastering the Box Model, you can control the layout, spacing, and sizing of your web elements, creating well-structured and visually appealing designs.

The CSS Box Model consists of four main components: content, padding, border, and margin.

The content area is where your text and images appear. It's the innermost part of the box.

```css
.scroll {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: #faf3e0;
}
```

Padding is the space between the content and the border. It creates inner spacing around the content.

```css
.scroll {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

The border surrounds the padding and content. It can be styled with different widths, colors, and styles.

```css
.scroll {
  border: 5px solid #d4af37;
}
```

Margin is the space outside the border. It creates outer spacing between elements.

```css
.scroll {
  margin: 20px;
}
```

By default, the width and height of an element are calculated for the content area only. However, you can include padding and border in the element's total width and height using the box-sizing property. Using `box-sizing: border-box` ensures that the padding and border are included in the element's specified width and height, making it easier to manage the element's size.
