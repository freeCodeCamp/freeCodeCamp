## Introduction to the Learn CSS Transforms by Building a Penguin

CSS Transforms allow you to manipulate the appearance of elements in 2D or 3D space. With transforms, you can rotate, scale, skew, and translate elements, giving your designs a dynamic and interactive feel.

The `transform` property allows you to apply 2D or 3D transformations to an element. For example, you can rotate an element:

```css
.shape {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
```

Or you can resize it:

```css
.shape {
  transform: scale(1.5);
}
```

By combining these properties, you can create dynamic and interactive shapes that captivate your audience.
