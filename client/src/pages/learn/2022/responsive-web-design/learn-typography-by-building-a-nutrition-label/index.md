## Introduction to the Learn Typography by Building a Nutrition Label

Typography is crucial for creating readable, aesthetically pleasing, and engaging text on your website.

The font-family property allows you to specify the font for your text. You can list multiple fonts as a fallback mechanism in case the primary font is not available.

```css
.spellbook-text {
  font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; /* Primary and fallback fonts */
}
```

The font-size property sets the size of the text. You can use various units like px, em, rem, %, etc.

```css
.spellbook-text {
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

The font-weight property sets the weight (or boldness) of the text.

```css
.spellbook-text {
  font-weight: 500;
}
```

You will learn about these and more in this project.
