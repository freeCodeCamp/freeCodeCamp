## Introduction to the Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers

Ready to add a splash of color to your web designs? CSS colors are essential for creating visually appealing web pages. They help you set the mood, highlight important elements, and make your designs more engaging.

CSS provides various ways to define colors. The most common methods are:

- Hexadecimal (Hex): A six-digit code representing the intensity of red, green, and blue (e.g., `#FF5733` for a bright orange).
- RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Specifies colors using the intensity of these three primary colors (e.g., `rgb(255, 87, 51)` for the same bright orange).
- RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha): Similar to RGB but includes an alpha channel for opacity (e.g., `rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5)` for a semi-transparent orange).
- HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness): Defines colors based on their hue, saturation, and lightness (e.g., `hsl(11, 100%, 60%)` for the same bright orange).
- HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha): Similar to HSL but includes an alpha channel for opacity (e.g., `hsla(11, 100%, 60%, 0.5)`).

CSS also supports 140 predefined color names like red, blue, green, and purple. These are easy to use and remember, making them perfect for quick styling.
