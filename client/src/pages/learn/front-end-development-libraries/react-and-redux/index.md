## Introduction to the React and Redux Challenges

This series of challenges introduces how to use Redux with React.

In a React Redux app, you create a single Redux store that manages the state of your entire app. Your React components subscribe to only the pieces of data in the store that are relevant to their role. Then, you dispatch actions directly from React components, which then trigger store updates.
