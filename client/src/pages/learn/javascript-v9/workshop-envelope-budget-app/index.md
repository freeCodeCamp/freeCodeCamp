## Introduction to the Build an Envelope Budget App

Sometimes when you're coding a web application, you'll need to be able to accept input from a user. In this envelope budget app project, you'll practice how to validate user input, perform calculations based on that input, and dynamically update your interface to display the results.

In this workshop, you'll learn basic regular expressions, template literals, the 1addEventListener()1 method, and more.
