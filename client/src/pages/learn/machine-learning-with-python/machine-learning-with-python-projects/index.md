## Introduction to the Machine Learning Projects

Machine learning has many practical applications. By completing these projects, you will demonstrate that you have a good foundational knowledge of machine learning.

We are still developing the interactive instructional content for the machine learning curriculum. For now, check out the videos in this [machine learning playlist on the freeCodeCamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAblStefaz_YOVpDWqcRScc2s). You may also have to use other resources (just like you would have to do when learning new technologies in a job).

In this section you will develop the following projects:

- Rock Paper Scissors
- Cat and Dog Image Classifier
- Book Recommendation Engine using KNN
- Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator
- Neural Network SMS Text Classifier

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514) method if you get stuck.
