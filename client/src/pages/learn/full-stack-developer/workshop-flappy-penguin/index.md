## Introduction to the Build a Penguin

You can transform HTML elements to create appealing designs that draw your reader's eye. You can use transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

In this workshop, you'll build a penguin. You'll use CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of your penguin, create a background, and animate your work.
