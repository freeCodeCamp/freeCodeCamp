## Introduction to the Design a Pricing Plans Layout Page

In this lab, you'll use flexbox to create a pricing plans layout page.

You'll practice aligning elements using flexbox properties like `order`, `flex-grow`, and `align-content`, and more.

This lab focuses on three key flexbox properties:

- **`order` property** - Control the visual order of flex items without changing the HTML structure
- **`flex-grow` property** - Make flex items grow to fill available space proportionally
- **`align-content` property** - Align wrapped flex lines within the container

You'll build a professional pricing cards layout that demonstrates these powerful CSS flexbox techniques.
