## Introduction to the Design a Pricing Plans Layout Page

In this lab, you'll create a responsive pricing plans layout using advanced flexbox properties. You'll learn how to control the order of elements, make elements grow to fill space, and align content within flex containers.

This lab focuses on three key flexbox properties that are essential for modern web layouts:

- **`order`** - Control the visual order of flex items without changing the HTML structure
- **`flex-grow`** - Make flex items grow to fill available space proportionally
- **`align-content`** - Align wrapped flex lines within the container

You'll build a professional pricing cards layout that adapts beautifully to different screen sizes while demonstrating these powerful CSS flexbox techniques.
