## Introduction to the Build a Shopping List App Workshop

In this workshop, you'll use the `useMemo()` and `useCallback()` hooks in React to build a simple shopping list app. You'll learn more about state and the lifecycle of React components, and how to use memoization to reduce re-renders and make your apps more efficient.
