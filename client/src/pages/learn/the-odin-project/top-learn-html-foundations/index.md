## Introduction to The Odin Project: Learn HTML Foundations

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) foundations are essential for anyone looking to create web pages. Understanding the basics of HTML is the first step towards building structured, semantic, and accessible web content.

The goal of this project is to master the fundamental concepts of HTML. You'll learn how to create and structure web pages using HTML tags and elements. This includes working with headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, and forms, as well as understanding the importance of semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO.

Proficiency in HTML is crucial for any web developer, as it forms the backbone of web content. Throughout this project, you'll engage in hands-on exercises that guide you through creating various HTML elements, nesting them correctly, and ensuring your code is clean and well-organized. By the end, you'll have the skills to build basic web pages and a strong foundation to build upon with CSS and JavaScript.
