## Introduction to The Odin Project: Learn CSS Specificity

Understanding CSS specificity is vital for any web developer aiming to create precise and maintainable stylesheets. Specificity determines which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules target the same element, allowing you to control and predict the outcome of your styling choices.

The goal of this project is to master the concept of CSS specificity. You'll learn how specificity is calculated, the impact of different selector types, and best practices for managing specificity in your stylesheets. This includes working with element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and inline styles, as well as understanding the importance of the cascade and inheritance.

Proficiency in CSS specificity is crucial for creating consistent and predictable web designs. Throughout this project, you'll engage in hands-on exercises that simulate real-world scenarios, such as resolving specificity conflicts, organizing your stylesheets for clarity, and avoiding common pitfalls like overly specific selectors. By the end, you'll have the skills to manage specificity effectively, ensuring your CSS is clean, scalable, and easy to maintain.
