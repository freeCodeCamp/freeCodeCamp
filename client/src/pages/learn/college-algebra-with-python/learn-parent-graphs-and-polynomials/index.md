## Introduction to Learn Parent Graphs and Polynomials

Understanding parent graphs and polynomials is essential in mathematics, providing foundational knowledge for analyzing and graphing various functions. In this video series, we will explore the fundamental concepts of parent graphs and polynomials, equipping you with the skills to understand, manipulate, and interpret these mathematical entities.

This unit will show you many different types of "parent" graphs, the basic patterns that make up more complicated graphs. Polynomials are mathematical expressions with "multiple things" - the more complicated equations that are built with basic patterns. You will see what these graphs look like, how to modify them, and how to do this all with Python code.

By the end of this series, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of parent graphs and polynomials, equipped with practical skills to graph, analyze, and manipulate these fundamental mathematical functions.
