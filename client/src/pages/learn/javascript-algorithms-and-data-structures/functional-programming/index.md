## Introduction to the Functional Programming Challenges

Functional programming is an approach to software development based around the evaluation of functions. Like mathematics, functions in programming map input to output to produce a result. You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.

Functional programming follows a few core principles:

- Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation
- Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data
- Functions have minimal side effects in the program

The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts. This section covers basic functional programming principles in JavaScript.
