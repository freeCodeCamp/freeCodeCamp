## Introduction to the Data Visualization with D3 Challenges

D3.js, or D3, stands for Data Driven Documents. D3 is a JavaScript library to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser. It's built to work with common web standards, namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).<br><br>D3 takes input data and maps it into a visual representation of that data. It supports many different data formats. D3 lets you bind (or attach) the data to the Document Object Model (DOM). You use HTML or SVG elements with D3's built-in methods to transform the data into a visualization.<br><br>D3 gives you a lot of control over the presentation of data. This section covers the basic functionality and how to create visualizations with the D3 library.
