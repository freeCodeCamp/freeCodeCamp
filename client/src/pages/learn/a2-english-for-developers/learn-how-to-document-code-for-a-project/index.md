## Introduction to the Learn How to Document Code for a Project

Effective code documentation is essential for maintaining, sharing, and understanding code within a project. Whether you’re working on a solo project, collaborating with a team, or contributing to open-source software, clear and comprehensive documentation ensures that others (and future you!) can understand and use your code effectively.

This course focuses on teaching you the skills and best practices needed to document code for a project. You will learn how to write clear comments, create informative README files, and document functions and classes effectively. Additionally, you’ll explore tools and techniques for generating documentation automatically and maintaining consistency across your codebase.

Throughout this course, you’ll engage in hands-on exercises, review real-world examples, and learn from industry-standard documentation practices. By the end, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge and confidence to document code in a way that enhances collaboration, facilitates maintenance, and promotes code quality.
