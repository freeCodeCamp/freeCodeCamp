## Introduction to the Build a Todo App using Local Storage

Local storage is a web browser feature that lets web applications store key-value pairs persistently within a user's browser. This allows web apps to save data during one session, then retrieve it in a later page session.

In this workshop, you'll learn how to handle form inputs, manage local storage, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks, implement event listeners, and toggle UI elements."
