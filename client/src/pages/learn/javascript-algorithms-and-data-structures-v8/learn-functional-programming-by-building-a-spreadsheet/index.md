## Introduction to the Learn Functional Programming by Building a Spreadsheet

Functional Programming is a powerful paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions, immutability, and declarative code. It offers a different approach to solving problems and structuring code, leading to more predictable, testable, and maintainable software.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to the core concepts of Functional Programming in JavaScript. You'll explore ideas such as pure functions, higher-order functions, function composition, and immutability, learning how to apply these principles to write cleaner and more efficient code.

Embracing Functional Programming can significantly enhance your problem-solving skills and code quality. Throughout this project, you'll tackle increasingly complex challenges, refactoring imperative code into functional alternatives and discovering how functional techniques can simplify complex operations, particularly when working with data transformations and asynchronous operations.
