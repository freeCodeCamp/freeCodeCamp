## Introduction to the Learn Basic Debugging by Building a Random Background Color Changer

Debugging is an essential skill for every programmer. It's the process of identifying, isolating, and fixing errors in code. Mastering basic debugging techniques can save you countless hours of frustration and help you write more reliable software.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to fundamental debugging concepts and tools. You'll learn how to read error messages, use console logging effectively, and leverage browser developer tools to track down and resolve common coding issues.

Effective debugging is what separates novice programmers from experienced ones. Throughout this project, you'll work with real-world code examples containing typical bugs, developing your problem-solving skills and building confidence in your ability to tackle coding challenges head-on.
