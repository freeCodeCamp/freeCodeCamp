## Introduction to the Review DOM Manipulation by Building a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the bridge between JavaScript and the content of a web page. DOM manipulation is a fundamental skill for front-end developers, allowing you to dynamically update, add, and remove content, creating interactive and responsive web applications.

The goal of this project is to master the art of DOM manipulation using JavaScript. You'll learn how to select and traverse DOM elements, modify content and attributes, create and remove elements, and handle events. Through these skills, you'll be able to transform static web pages into dynamic, interactive experiences.

Proficiency in DOM manipulation is essential for creating modern, user-friendly websites. Throughout this project, you'll work on hands-on exercises that simulate real-world scenarios, from building interactive forms to creating dynamic content loaders. By the end, you'll have the skills to bring your web pages to life, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.
