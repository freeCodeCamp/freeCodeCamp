## Introduction to the Review Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Dice Game

Building on the foundations of basic algorithmic thinking, intermediate algorithmic skills take your problem-solving abilities to the next level. This stage focuses on more complex problem-solving strategies, efficiency considerations, and the ability to analyze and optimize algorithms.

The goal of this project is to deepen your understanding of algorithmic thinking and introduce you to more advanced problem-solving techniques. You'll explore topics such as recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms, learning how to approach and solve more challenging computational problems.

Developing intermediate algorithmic thinking skills is crucial for tackling real-world programming challenges and preparing for technical interviews. Throughout this project, you'll work on progressively complex coding exercises and algorithm implementations, honing your ability to design efficient solutions and analyze algorithm performance.
