## Introduction to the Learn LocalStorage by Building a Todo App

LocalStorage is a powerful feature of modern web browsers that allows web applications to store data directly in the user's browser. This client-side storage solution enables developers to create more responsive and personalized web experiences, even when users are offline.

The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities and practical applications of LocalStorage in web development. You'll learn how to store, retrieve, and manage data using LocalStorage, understanding its advantages and limitations compared to other storage options.

Mastering LocalStorage is an essential skill for creating web applications that maintain state and provide a seamless user experience. Throughout this project, you'll work on hands-on exercises that demonstrate real-world use cases, from saving user preferences to building simple offline-capable applications, equipping you with the knowledge to enhance your web projects with persistent client-side data storage.
