## Introduction to Learn Recursion by Building a Decimal to Binary Converter

Recursion is a powerful programming concept where a function calls itself to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, repetitive tasks. It's a fundamental technique in computer science that enables elegant solutions to a wide range of programming challenges.

The goal of this project is to demystify recursion and help you master its application in JavaScript. You'll learn how to think recursively, understand the anatomy of recursive functions, and recognize problems that are well-suited for recursive solutions.

Mastering recursion is a significant milestone in your journey as a programmer. Throughout this project, you'll tackle increasingly complex recursive problems, from classic examples like factorial calculations to more advanced applications in tree traversal and dynamic programming. By the end, you'll have gained a powerful tool for solving intricate problems and a deeper understanding of how to approach complex algorithmic challenges.
