## Introduction to the Learn Basic Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Number Sorter

Algorithmic thinking is the foundation of computer science and a crucial skill for any programmer. It's the ability to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps that can be solved systematically and efficiently.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking. You'll learn how to approach problem-solving methodically, develop logical reasoning skills, and create step-by-step solutions to various computational challenges.

Developing algorithmic thinking skills is essential for becoming a proficient programmer. Throughout this project, you'll engage with puzzles, coding exercises, and real-world problems that will hone your ability to think like a computer scientist, setting the stage for tackling more advanced programming concepts in the future.
