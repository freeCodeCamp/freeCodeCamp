## Introduction to the Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Spam Filter

Regular Expressions, often called "regex" or "regexp", are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. They provide a concise and flexible means for identifying strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters, making them invaluable in various programming tasks.

The goal of this project is to demystify regular expressions and help you harness their power in JavaScript. You'll learn how to construct regex patterns, use regex methods, and apply these skills to solve real-world problems like form validation, data extraction, and text processing.

Mastering regular expressions can significantly enhance your efficiency as a programmer. Throughout this project, you'll work on practical exercises that simulate common use cases, from simple pattern matching to complex text analysis. By the end, you'll have added a versatile and powerful tool to your programming toolkit, enabling you to handle complex string operations with ease and precision.
