## Introduction to the Learn Basic OOP By Building A Shopping Cart

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm that forms the backbone of many modern programming languages, including JavaScript. It provides a way to structure code that's both intuitive and efficient, mirroring real-world objects and their interactions.

The goal of this project is to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of OOP. You'll learn about objects, classes, inheritance, and encapsulation, discovering how these principles can help you write cleaner, more organized, and reusable code.

Understanding OOP is a crucial step in your journey as a programmer. Throughout this project, you'll build progressively complex programs using OOP principles, gaining hands-on experience in designing and implementing object-oriented solutions to common programming challenges.
