## Introduction to the Data Analysis with Python Course Challenges

Learn Data Analysis with Python in this comprehensive tutorial. Data Analysis has been around for a long time, but up until a few years ago, it was practiced using closed, expensive and limited tools like Excel or Tableau. Python, SQL and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

In these lectures, create by Santiago Basulto from RMOTR, you will learn the whole process of Data Analysis: reading data from multiple sources (CSVs, SQL, Excel, etc), processing them using NumPy and Pandas, visualize them using Matplotlib and Seaborn and clean and process it to create reports.
Additionally, we've included a thorough Jupyter Notebook tutorial, and a quick Python reference to refresh your programming skills.
