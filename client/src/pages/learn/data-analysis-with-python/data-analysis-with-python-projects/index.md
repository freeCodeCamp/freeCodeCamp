## Introduction to the Data Analysis with Python Projects

There are many ways to analyze data with Python! By completing these projects, you will demonstrate that you have a good foundational knowledge of data analysis with Python.

We are working to finish up the interactive Data Analysis instructional content. For now, here are some videos from freeCodeCamp that will help with the projects. You may also have to use other resources (just like you would have to do when learning new technologies in a job).

- [Python NumPy Video Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUT1VHiLmmI) (1 hours)
- [Data Science Video Course](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ua-CiDNNj30) (6 hours)

In this section you will develop the following projects:

- Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
- Demographic Data Analyzer
- Medical Data Visualizer
- Page View Time Series Visualizer
- Sea Level Predictor

Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck-coding/19514) method if you get stuck.
