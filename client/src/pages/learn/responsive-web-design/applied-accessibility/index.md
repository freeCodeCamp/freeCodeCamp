## Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges

"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.

Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web.

Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:

1. have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
2. ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content
3. create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly

Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.
