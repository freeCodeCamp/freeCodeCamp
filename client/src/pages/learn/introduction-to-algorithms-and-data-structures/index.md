## Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures

Algorithms and Data Structures are the backbone of programming. So it important to learn how to work with them.

In this comprehensive course, you will learn about common sorting and searching algorithms including merge sort, quicksort and binary search.

You will also learn how to work with common data structures including arrays and linked lists.
