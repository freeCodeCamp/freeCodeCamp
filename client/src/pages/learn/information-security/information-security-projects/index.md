## Introduction to the Information Security Projects

Now it’s time to put your newly learned skills to work! By working on these projects, you will have the opportunity of applying all the skills, principles, and concepts from the Information Security sections.

In this section you get the chance to:

- Build a Stock Price Checker
- Build an Anonymous Message Board
- Port Scanner
- Packet Capturer
- Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game

When you are done, you will have plenty of Information Security projects under your belt along with a certification that you can show off to friends, family, and employers.
