## Introduction to Information Security with HelmetJS Challenges

HelmetJS is a type of middleware for Express-based applications that automatically sets HTTP headers to prevent sensitive information from unintentionally being passed between the server and client. While HelmetJS does not account for all situations, it does include support for common ones like Content Security Policy, XSS Filtering, and HTTP Strict Transport Security, among others. HelmetJS can be installed on an Express project from npm, after which each layer of protection can be configured to best fit the project.

Working on these challenges will involve you writing your code on Replit on our starter project. After completing each challenge, you can copy your public Replit URL (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it! Optionally, you may choose to write your project on another platform, but it must be publicly visible for our testing.

Start this project on Replit using <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec'>this link</a> or clone <a rel='noopener noreferrer' target='_blank' href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/'>this repository</a> on GitHub! If you use Replit, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe!
