# Challenge Map API Contribution

## Overview

This contribution adds a new API endpoint `/challenge-map` to support FCC Classroom integration. The endpoint provides a hash map of all active challenges in the freeCodeCamp curriculum, enabling FCC Classroom to resolve students' completed challenge data against the current curriculum structure.

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: FCC Classroom needs to integrate with FCC Proper to resolve students' completed challenges data. However, some challenges in user data are deprecated and no longer exist in the current curriculum.

**Solution**: This endpoint provides a reliable way to:
1. Get all active challenges from the current curriculum structure
2. Filter user completed challenges to exclude deprecated ones
3. Maintain compatibility with existing test data while handling curriculum evolution

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files
- `api/src/routes/public/challenge-map.ts` - Main endpoint implementation
- `api/src/routes/public/challenge-map.test.ts` - Comprehensive tests
- `api/src/routes/public/challenge-map.md` - API documentation
- `api/src/utils/filter-user-challenges.ts` - Utility functions for filtering user data
- `api/src/utils/filter-user-challenges.test.ts` - Tests for utility functions
- `tools/scripts/fcc-classroom-integration-example.js` - Integration example

### Modified Files
- `api/src/routes/public/index.ts` - Added challenge map route export
- `api/src/app.ts` - Registered the new route

## API Endpoint

### GET /challenge-map

Returns a complete mapping of all active challenges from the curriculum structure.

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "challengeMap": {
    "bd7123c8c441eddfaeb5bdef": {
      "title": "Say Hello to HTML Elements",
      "block": "basic-html-and-html5",
      "superblock": "responsive-web-design"
    }
  },
  "totalChallenges": 1500,
  "generatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Key Features

1. **Complete Curriculum Coverage**: Reads from `/curriculum/structure/` to include all active challenges
2. **Deprecated Challenge Handling**: Only includes challenges that exist in the current curriculum
3. **Error Resilience**: Gracefully handles missing files and continues processing
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for both endpoint and utility functions
5. **Integration Ready**: Includes example code and documentation for FCC Classroom

## Usage for FCC Classroom

### Basic Integration
```javascript
// Fetch challenge map
const response = await fetch('/challenge-map');
const { challengeMap } = await response.json();

// Filter user's completed challenges
const activeCompleted = userCompletedChallenges.filter(
  challenge => challengeMap.hasOwnProperty(challenge.id)
);
```

### Using Utility Functions
```javascript
import { filterActiveUserChallenges, getUserChallengeStats } from './utils/filter-user-challenges.js';

const activeCompleted = filterActiveUserChallenges(userCompletedChallenges, challengeMap);
const stats = getUserChallengeStats(userCompletedChallenges, challengeMap);
```

## Answers to Original Questions

1. **Does the structure folder contain freeCodeCamp's entire curriculum?**
   - ✅ **Yes** - The `/curriculum/structure/` folder is the single source of truth for active curriculum

2. **Should we disregard deprecated challenges in user-data.js?**
   - ✅ **Yes** - The API and utilities automatically filter out deprecated challenges

3. **Should we use user-data.js for testing?**
   - ✅ **Yes** - Continue using it as the canonical test dataset, filtering deprecated challenges as needed

## Testing

Run the tests:
```bash
# Test the endpoint
npm test -- challenge-map.test.ts

# Test the utility functions  
npm test -- filter-user-challenges.test.ts

# Run the integration example
node tools/scripts/fcc-classroom-integration-example.js
```

## Performance Considerations

- The endpoint builds the challenge map from the file system on each request
- Response size is approximately 100-200KB
- Consider implementing caching for production use
- All file system errors are handled gracefully

## Future Enhancements

1. **Caching**: Add Redis/memory caching to improve performance
2. **Incremental Updates**: Track curriculum changes and provide delta updates
3. **Versioning**: Add API versioning for backward compatibility
4. **Metrics**: Add monitoring for usage patterns
