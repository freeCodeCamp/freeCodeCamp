## freeCodeCamp.org's open-source codebase and curriculum

[freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) is a friendly community where you can learn to code for free. It is run by a [donor-supported 501(c)(3) nonprofit](https://donate.freecodecamp.org) to help millions of busy adults transition into tech. Our community has already helped more than 10,000 people get their first developer job.

Our full-stack web development and machine learning curriculum is completely free and self-paced. We have thousands of interactive coding challenges to help you expand your skills.

### Certifications

freeCodeCamp.org offers several free developer certifications. Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.

Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.

You can pull in these test suites through [freeCodeCamp's CDN](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js). This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Glitch - or even on your local computer's development environment.

Once you’ve earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or résumé. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they’ll see a verified certification specific to you.

The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/academic-honesty). When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.

### Reporting Bugs and Issues

If you think you've found a bug, first read the [how to report a bug](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-report-a-bug/19543) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug and have confirmed that someone else is facing the same issue, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug.

### Reporting Security Issues and Responsible Disclosure

If you think you have found a vulnerability, _please report responsibly_. Don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

We appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that might impact the integrity of our platforms and users. While we do not offer any bounties or swags at the moment, we'll be happy to list your name in our [Hall of Fame](HoF.md) for security researchers.

### Contributing

The freeCodeCamp.org community is possible thanks to thousands of kind volunteers like you. We welcome any and all contributions to the community and are excited to welcome you aboard.
