Think about things we encounter in our everyday life, like cars, shops, and birds. These are all objects: tangible things we can observe and interact with.

What are some qualities of these objects? A car has wheels. Shops sell items. Birds have wings. 
These qualities, or properties, define what makes up an object. It's important to note that cars might all have wheels, but not all cars will have the same number of wheels.

We can use objects in JavaScript to model real-world objects, endowing them with properties and behavior just like their real-world counterparts. We’ll use the previous concepts to create a “duck” object:

var duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
} 
We created a “duck” object with two property/value pairs: a name of Aflac and a numLegs of 2.

Instructions

Create a “dog” object with name and numLegs properties, and set them to a string and a number, respectively.

Challenge Description

Great job on defining that “dog” object. Now that we have created an object, let's talk about accessing some of these properties!

It's very simple to access the values of a property on an object. See the following example:

var duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
} 

console.log(duck.name)
//This will print "Aflac" to the console. 
By using our object name, duck, along with the property whose value we want to utilize, color, we access the property of your object.

Instructions

Print the properties of the Dog object below to your console.

      "description": [
Now that we know how to create an object and access its properties, let's explore a special property of objects. Namely, we will talk about adding a method to our existing objects!

Methods are properties that are functions. We can do all sorts of things with these methods. Let's look at the previous duck example, and add a method:

var duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + "."}
} 

duck.sayName();
//This will return "The name of this duck is Aflac."
As you can see above, we added the sayName method, which is a function that we can call to return a sentence telling us the color of the duck. This is a straightforward method of adding a method to an object in JavaScript.

Notice that we access the name of the duck in the method. We'll get back to that in the next lesson, but for now, this is the way we will insert that value into the string.

Instructions

In the following exercise, draw upon the previous “dog” object you created, and give it a method sayLegs. This method should return a sentence that says "This dog has 4 legs."

      "description": [
We are going to look at our sayName method from the previous example

  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + duck.name + "."}
Notice how we are referencing the variable name of our object, duck inside the sayName method in order to access the name property. While this is a totally valid way to access our object's property, there is a bit of a pitfall here.

What if the variable name of our object changes? What if, instead of a duck, it's a mallard now? Well, we would have to change duck.name to mallard.name. In this small example, that's fine, but what happens when we have an object that makes many references to its properties throughout its methods? Now the process gets much more complex!

There's a way to avoid that all. Introducing...this:

var duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2,
  sayName: function() {return "The name of this duck is " + this.name + "."}
} 
This is a very robust topic that would be a great idea to research more deeply. For now, understand that this, in the current context, refers to the object that our method is associated with: duck.

Now, if we changed our object's name to mallard, we don't have to find all our references to duck in our code. We've made our code more reusable and easy to read.

Instructions

Modify the dog.sayLegs method to remove any references to dog. It should follows the same code style as the duck object.

      "title": "Use a Mixin to add common behavior between unrelated objects",
      "description": [
As you have previously seen you can share behaviour through inheritance, but there are cases when inheritance is not the best solution. Inheritance does not work well for unrelated objects like Bird and Airplane. They can both fly, but a Bird is not a type of Airplane and vice versa.

For unrelated objects, it's better to use mixins. A mixin allows a collection of functions to be used by other objects.

var flyMixin = function(obj) {
    obj.fly = function() {
        console.log("Flying, wooosh!")
    }
}
The flyMixin takes any object and gives it the fly method.

var bird = {
    name: “Donald”,
    numLegs: 2,  
}

var plane = {
    model: “777”,
    numPassengers: 524 
}

flyMixin(bird); 
flyMixin(plane); 
Here bird and plane are passed into flyMixin, which then assigns the fly function to each object. Now bird and plane can both fly.

bird.fly(); //results in output on the screen: Flying, wooosh!
plane.fly(); //results in output on the screen: Flying, wooosh!
Note how the mixin allows for the same fly method to be reused by completely unrelated objects bird and plane.

      "description": [
In the previous challenge, bird had a public property name. We say it is public because it can be changed outside of the context of bird.

bird.name = "Duffy"
Any part of your code can therefore easily change the name of bird to any value. Think about things like passwords and bank accounts being easily changeable by any part of your codebase. That could be catastrophic.

The simplest way to make properties private is by creating a var within the constructor function. In this way the private properties can only be accessed and changed by privileged methods within the constructor.

function Bird() { 
  var hatchedEgg = 10; // private property

  this.getHatchedEggCount = function() { //publicly available method that a bird object can use
  return hatchedEgg();  
  }
}

ducky = new Bird(); 
ducky.getHatchedEggCount() //returns 10
Here getHachedEggCount is a privileged method, because it has access to the private variable hatchedEgg. This is possible because hatchedEgg is declared in the same context as getHatchedEggCount. In javascript a function always has access to the context in which it was created. This is called closure.

      "description": [
An immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) is often used to group related functionality into a single object or module. For example, in a previous section, we defined two mixins:

function glideMixin(obj) {
      obj.glide = function() {
        console.log("Gliding on the water")
      }
}

function flyMixin(obj) {
      obj.fly = function() {
        console.log("Flying, wooosh!")
      }
}
We can group these mixins into a module as follows:

var motionModule = (function () {
  return {
    glideMixin: function (obj) {
      obj.glide = function() {
        console.log("Gliding on the water")

      obj.fly = function() {
        console.log("Flying, wooosh!")
      }
    }
  }
}) (); // The two parentheses cause the function to be immediately invoked
Note that we have an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) whose sole purpose is to return an object. motionModule is this returned object. This returned object contains all of the mixin behaviors as properties on the object.

The advantage of the module pattern is that all of our motion behaviors can be packaged into a single object which can then be used by other parts of your code. Here we show a sample invocation:

motionModule.glideMixin(duck); 
duck.glide();

We already know one way to create an instance of Animal using the new operator:

var animal = new Animal();

var animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the prototype of animal to be Animal's prototype, we are effectively giving animal the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.

animal.eat(); // prints "nom nom nom"
animal instanceof Animal; //=> true

Use Object.create to make two instances of Animal named duck and beagle

Add Own Methods To Inherited Prototype

Challenge Description
A constructor function that inherits its prototype object from a super-type constructor function can still have its own methods in addition to inherited methods.

Let's use Bird for example, a constructor that inherits its prototype from Animal.

function Animal() {}
Animal.prototype.eat = function () { console.log("Nom nom nom"); };

function Bird() {}
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Bird.prototype.constructor = Bird;
In addition to what is inherited from Animal, we want to add behavior that is unique to birds. Let’s give Bird a fly() function. we add a function to Bird's protoype the same way we do with any constructor function: Bird.prototype.fly = function () { console.log("I'm flying!"); };

Now instances of Bird will have both eat() and fly() methods.

var duck = new Bird;
duck.eat(); // prints "Nom nom nom"
duck.fly(); // prints "I'm flying!"
Instructions
Add the necessary code to make beagle respond to eat() and bark().

      "description": [
In previous lessons, we learned that an object can inherit its behavior (methods) from another object by cloning its prototype object, like this ChildObject.prototype = Object.create(ParentObject.prototype). We gave ChildObject its own methods by chaining them onto its prototype, like this ChildObject.prototype.methodName = function () {...}.

We can override an inherited method the same way by adding a method to ChildObject.prototype using the same method name as the one we want to override.

Here's an example of Bird overriding the eat() method inherited from Animal.

function Animal(){}

Animal.prototype.eat = function() { return "Nom nom nom"; };

function Bird(){}

// inherit methods first, followed by method overrides
Bird.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

// Bird.eat() overrides Animal.eat()
Bird.prototype.eat = function () { return "Peck peck peck"; };
If we have an instance var duck = new Bird and we call duck.eat(), here’s how JavaScript looks for the method on duck’s prototype chain:
1. duck => Is eat() defined here? No.
2. Bird => Is eat() defined here? => Yes. Execute it and stop searching.
3. Animal => eat() is also defined here, but JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.
4. Object => JavaScript stopped searching before reaching this level.

name and numLegs are called own properties, because they are defined directly on the instance object. That means that duck and canary each has its own separate copy of these properties.

Since numLegs will probably have the same values for all instances of Bird, we essentially have a duplicated variable numLegs inside each Bird instance.

This may not be a big deal when we only have two instances, but imagine if we had millions of instances, that would be a LOT of duplicated variables.

A better way is to use Bird’s prototype. The prototype is an object that is shared among ALL instances of Bird. We’ll add numLegs to Bird’s prototype:

Bird.prototype.numLegs = 2

Now all instances of Bird have the numLegs property.

console.log(duck.numLegs);  // prints 2
console.log(canary.numLegs);  // prints 2
Since all instances are automatically endowed with the properties on the prototype, you can think of a prototype as a "recipe" for creating objects.

Note that the prototype for duck and canary lives on the Bird constructor as Bird.prototype. Nearly every object in javascript has a prototype property which lives on the constructor function that created it.

Note that the constructor property is equal to the constructor function that created the instance.

The advantage of the constructor property is that your code can inspect this property to find out what kind of object it is. One example illustrating how this could be used:

function joinBirdFraternity(candidate) {
    if (candidate.constructor === Bird) {

There is one crucial side effect of manually setting the prototype to a new object. We erased the constructor property! Our code in the previous challenge would print the following for duck

console.log(duck.constructor) // prints ‘undefined’.  Oops!  
To fix this, whenever we manually set a prototype to a new object, we must remember to define the constructor property.

Bird.prototype = {
    constructor: Bird, // define the constructor property
    numLegs: 2, 
    eat: function() {
        console.log(“nom nom nom”);

Define the "constructor" property on the Dog prototype.

      "description": [
Constructors are functions that create new objects. They define properties and behaviors that will belong to the new object. You can think of them as a blueprint for the creation of new objects.

Here is an example of a constructor:

function Bird () {
  this.name = 'Albert';
  this.color = 'blue';
  this.numLegs = 2;
}
This constructor defines a Bird object with properties name, color, and numLegs set to Albert, blue and 2, respectively.

Constructors follow a few conventions:

Constructors are defined with a capitalized name to distinguish them from other functions that are not constructors.

Constructors use the keyword this to set properties of the object they will create. Inside the constructor, this refers to the new object it will create.

Constructors define properties and behaviors instead of returning a value as other functions might.

Instructions:

Now create your own constructor, Dog, with properties name, color, and numLegs set to a string, a string, and a number, respectively.

Let’s see our Bird constructor from the previous challenge in action:

function Bird () {
  this.name = 'Albert';
  this.color  = 'blue';
  this.numLegs = 2;
  // ‘this’ inside the constructor always refers to the object being created
}

var blueBird = new Bird();
Notice that we use the new operator when calling our constructor. This tells JavaScript that we want to create a new instance of Bird. Without the new operator, this inside the constructor would not point to the newly created object, giving us unexpected results.

Now blueBird has all the properties defined inside the Bird constructor:

blueBird.name; // => Albert
blueBird.color; // => blue
blueBird.numLegs; // => 2
Just like any other object, its properties can be accessed and modified:

blueBird.name = 'Elvira';
blueBird.name; // => Elvira

      "description": [
The Bird and Dog constructors we created were pretty cool. However, notice that all Birds we create with our Bird constructor are automatically named Albert, are blue in color, and have two legs. What if we want birds with different values for name and color? We could change the properties of each bird manually but that would be a lot of work:

  var swan = new Bird();
  swan.name = 'Carlos';
  swan.color = 'white';
Suppose we were writing a program to keep track of hundreds or even thousands of different birds in an aviary. It would be time consuming to create all the birds and go through each of them, setting their properties to different values.

To more easily enable the construction of different Bird objects, we can design our Bird constructor to accept parameters:

 function Bird(name, color) {
    this.name = name;
    this.color = color;
    this.numLegs = 2;
  }
We can then pass in the values that will define our unique bird as arguments to our Bird constructor:

var cardinal = new Bird('Bruce', 'red');
This gives a new instance of Bird with name and color properties set to Bruce and red, respectively. The numLegs property is still set to 2.

As we can see, cardinal has these properties:

  cardinal.name // => Bruce
  cardinal.color // => red
  cardinal.numLegs // => 2
The flexibility of our constructor has increased. We can now define the properties we want to assign to each Bird at the time we create it.

This capability brings us closer to understanding why JavaScript constructors are so useful. Constructors allow us to group objects together based on shared characteristics and behavior and define a blueprint that automates their creation.

Instructions:

Create another Dog constructor. This time, set it up to take the arguments name and color, and have the property numLegs fixed at 4. Then create a new Dog, passing it two strings for the name and color properties, setting it equal to the variable terrier.

Anytime we create a new object using a constructor function, that object is said to be an instance of its constructor. JavaScript gives us a convenient way to verify this programmatically. Enter the instanceof operator. instanceof allows us to compare an object to a constructor, returning true or false based on whether or not that object was created with the constructor.

var Bird = function(name, color) {
  this.name = name;
  this.color = color;
  this.numLegs = 2;
}

var crow = new Bird('Alexis', 'black');

crow instanceof Bird; // => true
If we create an object without using a constructor, instanceof will verify that it is not an instance of that constructor:

var canary = {
  name: 'Mildred',
  color: 'Yellow',
  numLegs: 2
}

canary instanceof Bird; // => false

All objects in javascript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. It turns out that an object’s prototype itself is an object.

function Bird(name) {

typeof Bird.prototype; // => object
Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:

Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);  // => true
How is this useful to us? You may recall the hasOwnProperty method from a previous challenge:

var duck = new Bird(“donald”);
duck.hasOwnProperty(“name”); // => true
The hasOwnProperty method is defined in Object.prototype, which can be accessed by Bird.prototype, which can then be accessed by duck. This illustrates the prototype chain.

In this prototype chain, we say that Bird is the supertype for duck, while duck is the subtype. Object is a supertype for both Bird and duck.

Object is in fact a supertype for all objects in javascript. Therefore any object will respond to the hasOwnProperty method.

      "description": [
There's a principle in programming called "Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)". The reason repeated code is a problem is because any change requires fixing code in multiple places, which means more work for programmers and more room for errors.

Notice in the example below that the describe method is shared by Bird and Dog:

Bird.prototype = {
    constructor: Bird, 
    describe: function() {
        console.log("My name is " + this.name);
    }
};

Dog.prototype = {
    constructor: Dog,
    describe: function() {
        console.log("My name is " + this.name);
    }
};
The describe method is therefore repeated in two places. We can make our code more DRY by creating a supertype (or parent) called Animal:

function Animal(){
};

Animal.prototype = {
    constructor: Animal, 
    describe: function() {
        console.log("My name is " + this.name);
    }
};
Since Animal includes the describe method, we can then remove it from Bird and Dog.

Bird.prototype = {
    constructor: Bird
};

Dog.prototype = {
    constructor: Dog
};
