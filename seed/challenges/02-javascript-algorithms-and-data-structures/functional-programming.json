"Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's inspect some bad habits first.",
"Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and we want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.",
"A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open, each window having lot of tabs open. We keep titles of each site open in each Window object as an array.",
"We shall try to move some windows, merge them together, close some tabs, open few other tabs - and print tabs you have open after all these operations.",
"For sake of simplicity, let's assume you can open a tab only at the end, so it would always be appended to the array of tab titles. However, we can close a tab at any position (removing any array item).",
"Consider the implementation in the code section with these functions:",
"tabOpen(), tabClose(), join(). The Window object has an array tabs, which is the array that stores the information about open pages.",
"Instructions",
"Run the code by either using Run button, or using Ctrl + Enter. The final list of open tabs should be ['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium', 'Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vine', 'GMail', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'FreeCodeCamp', 'new tab']; but you would get a slightly different answer.",
"In particular, the final array you would get by running the code, would have one element less. You should work out the answer by using pen-paper; or you can even create three browser windows with those tabs and follow the steps given in code exactly; to see what all tabs are left."

"If you haven't already figured it out; the issue was with the splice() call in the tabClose() function. Before we get to fixing that, let's take a moment to think.",
"This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable or an array or an object; and they change something in them.",
"One of the core principle of functional programming - don't change things! Changing stuff leads to bugs. It's much easier to keep on coding if you can blindly rely upon function calls, that they don't mutate anything - neither the function arguments, nor any global variable.",
"In our previous example, we didn't even get to any complicated operation. Heck, we don't even have basic error checking (like closing tabs even if they are not open). Yet, we end up with a bug. It's like a minefield out there in coding land!",
"In functional programming, changing or altering things are called mutation, and the outcome is called side-effect. A function, ideally, should be pure function, free from side-effects.",
