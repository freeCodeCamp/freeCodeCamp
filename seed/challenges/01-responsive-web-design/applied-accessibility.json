This means it is important for the heading tags in your markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values. If you were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion as a subsection of the body in your outline, right? Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationships of your content - ones with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.",

First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them. We've covered having text alternatives to address the first issue. The last challenge introduced contrast checking tools to help with the second. The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.",

You may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors. In practice, the 4.5:1 ratio can be reached by darkening the darker color and lightening the lighter one with the aid of a color contrast checker. Darker colors on the color wheel are considered to be blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.",

          "HTML5's <code>audio</code> element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to the deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.",
          "The <code>audio</code> tag supports the <code>controls</code> attribute, which shows the browser default play, pause, etc. controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, it's presence on the tag turns the setting on.",
          "Here's an example:",
          "<blockquote>&lt;audio id=&quot;meowClip&quot; controls&gt;<br>    &lt;source src=&quot;audio/meow.mp3&quot; type=&quot;audio/mpeg&quot; /&gt;<br>    &lt;source src=&quot;audio/meow.ogg&quot; type=&quot;audio/ogg&quot; /&gt;<br>&lt;/audio&gt;<br></blockquote>",
          "Note: Multimedia content, which usually has both visual and auditory components, needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.",

Then place a <code>source</code> tag inside the <code>audio</code> tags with the <code>src</code> attribute set to \"https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3\" and <code>type</code> attribute set to \"audio/mpeg\"."
