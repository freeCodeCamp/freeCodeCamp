By setting and configuring a Content Security Policy you can prevent the injection of anything unintended into your page. This will protect protect your app from XSS vulnerabilities, undesidered tracking, malicious frqmes, and much more. CSP works by defining a whitelist of content sources which are trusted. You can configure them for each kind of resource a web page may need (scripts, stylesheets, fonts, frames, media, and so on…). There are multiple directives available, so a website owner can have a granular control. See HTML 5 Rocks, KeyCDN for more details. Unfortunately CSP in unsupported by older browser.",

Set also the scriptSrc directive so that you will allow scripts to be downloaded from your website, and from the domain trusted-cdn.com.",
