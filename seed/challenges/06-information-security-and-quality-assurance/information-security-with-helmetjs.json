This is accomplished by feeding the original data into a algorithm and having returned a fixed length result.

Salting your hash involves adding random data to the original data before the hashing process which makes it even harder to crack the hash.",

The first small bit of data <code>$2a</code> is defining what kind of hash algorithm was used. The next portion <code>$13</code> defines the <em>cost</em>. Cost is about how much power it takes to compute the hash. It is on a logarithmic scale of 2^cost and determines how many times the data is put through the hashing algorithm. For example, at a cost of 10 you are able to hash 10 passwords a second on an average computer, however at a cost of 15 it takes 3 seconds per hash... and to take it further, at a cost of 31 it would takes multiple days to complete a hash. A cost of 12 is considered very secure at this time.

      "description": [
        "Hashing synchronously is just as easy to do but can cause lag if using it server side with a high cost or with hashing done very often. Hashing with this method is as easy as calling <code>var hash = bcrypt.hashSync(myPlaintextPassword, saltRounds);</code>",
        "<hr>Add this method of hashing to your code and then log the result to the console. Again, the variables used are already defined in the server so you wont need to adjust them. You may notice even though you are hashing the same password as in the async function, the result in the console is different- this is due to the salt being randomly generated each time as seen by the first 22 characters in the third string of the hash.",
        "Now to compare a password input with the new sync hash, you would use the compareSync method: <code>var result = bcrypt.compareSync(myPlaintextPassword, hash);</code> with the result being a boolean true or false. Add this function in and log to the console the result to see it working.",
