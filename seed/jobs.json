    "description": "Live life one inhalation and one exhalation at a time. May you be healthy. Let the muscles in your neck and shoulders relax. May you be safe. Reflect on the fragility and preciousness of life.  Empty your mind; be formless, shapeless like water. May you be at peace. Take a deep breath. You can do what you set out to do; yes, you can. You can do what you set out to do; yes, you can. Watch each breath appear and disappear, just breathing. Give yourself a break. Live life one inhalation and one exhalation at a time.  Give yourself a break. Just acknowledge what's there and let be. You can get through this. Open your heart to change, forgiveness and lovingkindness. Love is the first seed of the soul. It will be ok.  Impermanence and change is a powerful teacher and teaching. Bring love into your heart, into your breath and into your being. Briefly notice any emotions, thoughts or sensations that may be driving fear and anxiety and let them be. This discomfort will pass. Bring love into your heart, into your breath and into your being. Take a deep breath. Reflect on the fragility and preciousness of life."
