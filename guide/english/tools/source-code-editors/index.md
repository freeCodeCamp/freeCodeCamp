## Source Code Editors

Source code editors are the programs that allow for code creation and  
editing. Any text editor can be used to write code. But dedicated code  
editors offer many useful features, including: text completion,  
markup coloring, and tabs/panes for side-by-side editing. These features can  
be useful even to new users who don't know their way around all of the  
advanced options.

There are many, many editors available to download or use  
online, both paid and free. They offer many of the same core-features, but  
each have their own subtleties. Further research may help find the one that's  
right for you. The following editors are all cross-platform and  
free to use or evaluate.
