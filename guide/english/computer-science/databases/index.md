## Databases

A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. Database designers typically organize the data to model aspects of reality in a way that supports processes requiring information, such as (for example) modeling the availability of rooms in hotels in a way that supports finding a hotel with vacancies.

The database management system (DBMS) is the software that interacts with end users, applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS allows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases. A database is generally stored in a DBMS-specific format which is not portable, but different DBMSs can share data by using standards such as SQL and ODBC or JDBC. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and its associated applications can be referred to as a "database system". Often the term "database" is used to loosely refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.

Computer scientists may classify database-management systems according to the database models that they support. Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. These model data as rows and columns in a series of tables, and the vast majority use SQL for writing and querying data. In the 2000s, non-relational databases became popular, referred to as NoSQL because they use different query languages. <a href='https://github.com/freecodecamp/guides/tree/master/src/pages/computer-science/databases/index.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Help our community expand it</a>.
