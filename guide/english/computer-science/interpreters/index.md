## Interpreters

Interpreters are a kind of translator. Interpreters take source code - code written in JavaScript, Python, and other languages. Then they translate it into code the computer understands.

This translated code is [binary code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code). It is nothing but 1s and 0s. Interpreters translate the source code line-by-line, while running the binary code. The program will run until the interpreter finds errors in the source code. Then it will stop translating/running the program and flag the errors.

To compare, compilers convert all the source code at once to binary code, then run the binary code.
