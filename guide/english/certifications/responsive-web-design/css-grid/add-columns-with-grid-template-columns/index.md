## Add Columns with grid-template-columns

In this challenge, you are required to define columns for the grid.

### Hint

You can define columns by declaring the following in your CSS codeblock:

````css
grid-template-columns: parameters;
````

where parameters is whatever you want it to be.

### Solution

Since the challenge requires you to create three columns of 100px each, declare the following in your .container CSS codeblock:

````css
grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
````
