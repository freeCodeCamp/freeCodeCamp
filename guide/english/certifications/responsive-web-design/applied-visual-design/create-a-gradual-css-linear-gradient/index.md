 ## Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient

To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

The syntax is always:

```
background-image: linear-gradient(angle, color-stop1, color-stop2);
```

The colors can be used in both hex() and rgb() formats. Experiment a bit and you'll understand how easy and beautiful it is to use it.
