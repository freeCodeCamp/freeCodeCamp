## How to Use package.json, the Core of Any Node.js Project or npm Package

This is a simple exercise, you should be able to complete it by following the steps listed in the exercise itself.

CAUTION:

Note that there is an issue with Glitch, where the link that clones the specific FreeCodeCamp app on Glitch may not actually clone the app and instead give you the default Glitch app. The README.MD file should say "Backend Challenges boilerplate - package.json", if it doesn't, you don't have the FreeCodeCamp version of the app and your tests will not pass. The solution is to try until you actually get the the proper app imported.

You should go over to the `package.json` file in your project. As mentioned in the instructional section of the lesson, JSON is written in key pairs like this:

```code
"author": "Jane Doe",
```
