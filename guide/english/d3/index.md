# D3: Data-Driven Documents

**Data-Driven Documents** (D3.js) is a JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. **D3.js** API contains various methods which can be grouped into the following logical units - *Selections*, *Transitions*, *Arrays*, *Math*, *Color*, *Scales*, *SVG*, *Time*, *Layouts*, *Geography*, *Geometry*, *Behaviors*.

**D3.js** helps you visualize data by combining powerful visualization and interaction techniques with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation. It also provides full capabilities of modern browsers by designing the right visual interface for your data.

**D3.js** version 1.0.0 was released back in 18 February 2011.

## Why D3.js?

*D3** does not introduce a new visual representation. Unlike **Processing**, **Raphaël**, or **Protovis**, *D3's* vocabulary of graphical marks comes directly from web standards: HTML, SVG, and CSS - https://d3js.org/

###### Get Started
There are over 20,000+ **D3.js** examples you could learn from, but you never know how approachable any given one will be! So, the question is - how do you build up your visualization from first principles? As you've probably seen, D3's API is massive, so lets call out a few of the utilities that will be particularly helpful early on:

- **d3-scale**

- **d3-shape**

- **d3-force**

 So, with just some basic knowledge of latest HTML5 features such as SVG, Canvas you can dive into a world where library like **D3.js** bring data to life!
