## PHP Operators

<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</p>
<p>PHP divides the operators in the following groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
  <li>Assignment operators</li>
  <li>Comparison operators</li>
  <li>Increment/Decrement operators</li>
  <li>Logical operators</li>
  <li>String operators</li>
  <li>Array operators</li>
</ul>
<h3>PHP Arithmetic Operators</h3>
<p>The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.</p>
