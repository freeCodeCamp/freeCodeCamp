## Loops

Loops are used in PHP to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. 

Conditions typically return `true` or `false` when analyzed. 

A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns `false`.

You can type `php for` , `php while` or `php do while` to get more info on any of these.
