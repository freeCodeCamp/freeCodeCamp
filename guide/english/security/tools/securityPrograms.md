## Security Programs

There are many security programs and tools that can help protect you from malware, spyware, and cyber-attacks. In fact, most computers, routers, and modems these days come with built in security that protects you from a fair amount of cyber threats. However, we are specifically going to focus on other tools and applications you can find that are not pre-installed on your system that will help you stay protected in the 21st Century.

#### This application offers free and paid versions.

CCleaner is a utility application that can help you clear internet and application cache and cookies downloaded to your computer quickly and safely. If you do not want to immediately remove the cache and cookies, CCleaner also offers an Analyze tool that allows you to look at how much space individual cache and cookies are taking up. In addition to this feature, CCleaner also offers some other utilities including a computer Registry cleaner, Program Uninstaller, advanced PC Startup tool, Browser Plugin viewer for all installed browsers, Disk Analyzer tool, Duplicate File Finder, System Restore tool, and a Drive Wiper tool. CCleaner can also be installed on a flash drive for if you are on the go, or deal with multiple computers on a daily basis and it would be too much of a hassle to install it on each of them.

The exact differences between the paid and free versions of the tool are listed in the screen shot below, and on their website, which is hyperlinked in the header above.

Although CCleaner is not explicitly a Security Program, it can help find other badly behaving programs and applications, as well as potentially remove spyware and other malware. All in addition to decluttering your drive(s), increasing productivity, and adding to the overall safety of your data.
