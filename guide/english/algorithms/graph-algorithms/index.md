## Graph algorithms

Graph algorithms are a set of instructions that traverse (visits nodes of a) graph.

Some algorithms are used to find a specific node or the path between two given nodes. 

### Why Graph Algorithms are Important

A graphs are very useful data structures which can be to model various problems. These algorithms have direct applications on Social Networking sites, State Machine modeling and many more.

### Some Common Graph Algorithms
Some of the most common graph algorithms are:
