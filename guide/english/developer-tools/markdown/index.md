## Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name. Markdown is often used to format README files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.  You can also write Markdown in your text editor (like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code).
Markdown is gaining in visibility and popularity through the emergence of streamlined, "distraction-free" text editors.
