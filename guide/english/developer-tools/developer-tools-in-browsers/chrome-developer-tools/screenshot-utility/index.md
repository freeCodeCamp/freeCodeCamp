### DevTools screenshot functionality
When using Chrome developer tools, it can be useful to capture a screenshot of the entire page. And while there are add-ons to achieve this, google chrome has its own functionality built in.

## Steps
1. Open Chrome Devtools
2. in Devtools Ctrl+P (Cmd+P on Mac)
3. Start typing >screenshot
4. Choose from the available functions (capture full size screenshot has been by far my most useful)
5. Enjoy your new screenshot
