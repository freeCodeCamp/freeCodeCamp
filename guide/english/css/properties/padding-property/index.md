## Padding Property

CSS `padding` property adds internal space between the content and border of element. You may use `padding-top`, `padding-right`, `padding-bottom` and `padding-left` for a specific side of an element, but `padding` is shorthand version for all these properties. If: 

* One value is provided it will apply to all sides of element
* Two values are provided, first value will apply top and bottom sides and second value will apply to left and right sides of element.
* Three values are provided, first value will apply to top, second value will apply left and right, third value will apply bottom sides of element.
* Four values are provided, values will apply in the following order: top, right, bottom, left.
