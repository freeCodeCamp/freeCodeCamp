### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. It was first invented in 1996, and is now a standard feature of all major web browsers.

CSS allows developers to control how web pages look by "styling" the HTML structure of that page.

CSS specifications are maintained by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).

You can build some pretty amazing things in CSS alone, such as this pure-CSS [Minesweeper game](https://codepen.io/bali_balo/pen/BLJONk) (which uses no JavaScript).
