## What are Arrays?  
An array is a series of elements of the same data type which are stored in contiguous memory locations and can be referenced individually.  

For example, an array containing 5 integer values called numbers is declared like so:  
```C++
int numbers [5];
```

Initializiation:  
```C++
//Initialization with entries:
int numbers [5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

//Initialization with no values:
int numbers [5] = {};

//Initialization with declaration:
int numbers [] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
//Note that here the number of values defines the size of the array.
//In the examples above, the size was fixed beforehand

Two-Dimensional Arrays

The simplest form of the multidimensional array is the two-dimensional array. A two-dimensional array is, in essence, a list of one-dimensional arrays. To declare a two-dimensional integer array of size x,y, you would write something as follows −
type arrayName [ x ][ y ];

int a[3][4] = {  
   {0, 1, 2, 3} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 0 */
   {4, 5, 6, 7} ,   /*  initializers for row indexed by 1 */
   {8, 9, 10, 11}   /*  initializers for row indexed by 2 */
};

```
## Types Of Arrays
There are two types of array based on way, we declare it.

**1**. Static array:
Those arrays whose size is defined before compile time like in the examples above, are called static arrays. In these arrays we can't change their size, once they are declared.

**2**. Dynamic array:
Dynamic arrays are those arrays, whose size is not known at compile time and we can define their size at run time. These arrays are created by using **new** keyword and when done with that array we can delete that array by using the **delete** keyword.

### Access:  
Elements from an array can be accessed via reference of their position in the array. (Start counting from 0).  
Example:  
```C++
x = numbers[0]; // = 1. [0] == first position
numbers[2] = 55; // Sets the third position (3) to the new number 55
//numbers[] is now: {1, 2, 55, 4, 5}
```
