## Cloud Development

Cloud development is the usage of software engineering practices on infrastructure components in a shared resource pool. This can be done in multiple manners, within your company or organizations own data center, or in a "public" shared datacenter owned and operated by a third party.

Popular choices for Public Cloud providers are Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine. These providers operate clusters of massive datacenters whereby thousands of different individuals, companies, and organizations consume these resources. Operating the Cloud involves enabling the partitioning of these shared resources for the usage of these different users. The consumption of the resources is tracked (also referred to as metered) and then billed back to the user depending on the different financial scheme for the various compute, network, and storage resources consumed. Private cloud storage clients such as Veeam are also used on a large scale, mostly when dealing with government and civil virtual architectures.

Many modern websites and big data efforts are said to be developed in the Cloud, meaning they are operating in some of these massive shared datacenters.

## Cloud Layers

### Software as a Service
SaaS is from a end user perspective, meaning that at this layer cloud providers will host and provide a software/application as a whole, running,  to the end users. One good example could be Google Drive here.

### Platform as a Service
PaaS is from the service provider perspective, meaning that at this layer the cloud providers will provide us the platform used for developing the applications offered as a SaaS. One good example could be Google App Engine.

### Infrastructure as a Service
IaaS is from the infrastructure provider perspective, meaning that at this layer the cloud providers will provide us the virtualised resources like CPU, memory and storage on a pay per use basis. One good example could be Amazon EC2.
