## JavaScript vs TypeScript

![Where's Waldo](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/DznuAou.jpg)

Okay so now that we have a general sense of what TypeScript is, let’s play a quick game of **Where’s Waldo**.

In the above screenshot, you can spot the differences between `JavaScript` & `TypeScript` in this very simple multiplication program that just prints out the product of two numbers I’ve pre-defined.

### What are those differences though? 🤔️

They're **types**!

So `JavaScript` has dynamic typing in that a variable declared as a number can be turned into a string where as `TypeScript` has static typing meaning you declare beforehand what type of value the variable will hold and it doesn’t change.

In that `multiplication.ts` file, I’m declaring all these variables to be numbers so they cannot be changed to something else.
