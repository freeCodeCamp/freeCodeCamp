title: Optical Alignment -- When the "Wrong" Spacing Looks Right

## Optical Alignment

In typography, text that is properly [kerned](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/typography/kerning-and-tracking/) typically appears evenly spaced and legible. However, in some fonts and in some settings (especially logotypes) letter pairs can appear as though there is uneven space between them despite the actual measurements being identical. The process of adjusting the kerning between two letters so that they appear equal is called _optically aligning_ them. Though it may seem unintuitive, your human eye is much better at perceiving small differences than a computer is, and optically aligning text will provide a smoother transition from letter to letter.
