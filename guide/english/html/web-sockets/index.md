## WebSockets

*Web Sockets* is a technology that allows you to create an interactive connection between a client and a server for exchanging data in real time. WebSockets allow you to work in two streams, which distinguishes this technology from HTTP.

## How do WebSockets work?

WebSockets do not need repeated calls to respond. It is enough to make one request and wait for a response. You can listen to the server, which will send the answer on readiness.

## When can I use WebSockets?

* Chat application
* IoT applications
* Multiplayer games


## When not to use WebSockets?

WebSockets are already supported in 95% of browsers, but sometimes this technology is not required. For example, if you are creating a simple CMS where real-time functionality is not required.
