## Em Tag

The `<em>` tag is used to *emphasize* text in an HTML document. This can be done by wrapping the text you would like to be emphasized in an `<em>` tag. Most browsers will render text wrapped in an `<em>` tag as italicized.

Note: The `<em>` tag should not be used to stylistically italicize text. The `<em>` tag is used to stress emphasis on text.

### Example:
```
<body>
  <p>
    Text that requires emphasis should go <em>here</em>.
  </p>
</body>
```
