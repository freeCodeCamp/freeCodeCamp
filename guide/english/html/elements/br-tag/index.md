## Br Tag

The `<br>` tag produces a line break in a text. This is useful for poems and addresses. The `<br>` tag is an empty tag which means that it has no closing tag.

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    Mozilla Foundation<br>
    1981 Landings Drive<br>
    Building K<br>
    Mountain View, CA 94043-0801<br>
    USA
  </body>
</html>
