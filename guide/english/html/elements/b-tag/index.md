## B Tag

The `<b>` tag is used to specify bold text, without conveying any special importance or relevance. When bolding text of special importance or relevance, it is recommended that you use the `<strong>` tag. 

In HTML5, the `<b>` tag should only be used as a last option.

### Example:
```html
<b>This text is bold</b>
```
This would appear as:

**This text is bold**
