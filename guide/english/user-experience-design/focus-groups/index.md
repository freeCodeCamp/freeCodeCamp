## Focus Groups

### Definitions

* A group of people who have been brought together to discuss a particular subject in order to solve a problem or suggest ideas. - Cambridge Dictionary<br>
* A group of people brought together to give their opinions on a particular issue or product, often for the purpose of market research. -Collins English Dictionary

Α focus group is a group of people gathered together because of their common characteristics, such as age, gender, occupation, income, etc. Focus groups are formed in order to conduct market research for specific demographic groups. <br>

Unlike an interview, where the input comes from a single person, focus groups provide multiple viewpoints from different people, which creates more diverse and accurate insight into a market. Additionally, discussions in focus groups allow people to interact with each other, form new opinions and see different perspectives of the topic in question.
