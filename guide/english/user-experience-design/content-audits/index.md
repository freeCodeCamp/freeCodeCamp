## Content Audits

Content audits its a task from the Information Architecture stage within a UX project. A content audit is an activity of checking all of the content on a website(Copy, Images, video, and any other type of content) and compiling it into a big list or file. There are three main types of audits you can perform:

-Full content inventory: A complete compilation of every content on the site. This may include all urls as well as all assets (such as downloadable files and videos).</br>
-Partial content inventory: A listing of a subset of the site’s content. A partial inventory may include, for example, the top few levels of a hierarchical site or the past six months of articles. All sections of the site will be covered.</br>
-Content sample: A less detailed collection of example content from the site.

The content audit type will depend on the nature of the request, mostly for website redesign its required to do a full content inventory, for project maintenance, it's a partial one!
