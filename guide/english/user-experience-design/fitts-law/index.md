## Fitts Law
Fitts's Law provides a model of human movement which can accurately predict the amount of time taken to move to and select a target. In human-computer interaction Fitts's Law is typically applied to movement through the graphical user interface using a cursor or other type of pointer.

The law describes a simple rule of UI design that the distance from one point to the next should be reduced, while having the target object be larger to reduce the amount of time for selecting a target. Ideally, the further the user has to traverse towards a target, the larger that target should be in order to make the interaction more smooth.

In 1954, psychologist Paul Fitts, examining the human motor system, showed that the time required to move to a target depends on the distance to it, yet relates inversely to its size. By his law, fast movements and small targets result in greater error rates, due to the speed-accuracy trade-off. Although multiple variants of Fitts’ law exist, all encompass this idea. Fitts’ law is widely applied in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. For example, this law influenced the convention of making interactive buttons large (especially on finger-operated mobile devices)—smaller buttons are more difficult (and time-consuming) to click. Likewise, the distance between a user’s task/attention area and the task-related button should be kept as short as possible.
