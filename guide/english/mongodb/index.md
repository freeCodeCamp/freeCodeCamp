## MongoDB

MongoDB is an open-source non-relational Database that uses a JSON like structure to store data. 
It uses a document model to store and retrieve the data instead of the table model used by sequential databases such as SQL or Oracle.
MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.
