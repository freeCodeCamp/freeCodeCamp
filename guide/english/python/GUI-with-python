## Using Interact

The interact function (ipywidgets.interact) automatically creates user interface for exploring code and data inertactively.
It is one of the easiest way to start the iPython's widgets.

  >>> #Starting with the some imports:
  
  from __future__ import print_function
  from ipywidgets import interact, interactive, fixed
  import ipywidgets as widgets
  

### #Basic Interact

At the basic level, <b> interact </b> auto-generates UI controls for function arguments, and then
calls the function with those arguments when we manipulate the controls ineractively.
To use the function <b> interact </b>, we need to define a function that we want to explare. Here is a
function that prints its only argument <b> x </b>.

    >>> Basic function
    def f(x):
        return x
        
When we pass the function as the first argument to <b> interact </b> along with an integer keyword argument(x=10),
a slider is generated and bound to the function parameter.

    >>> #Generating a slider to interact with
    interact(f, x=10,);
    -8

When we move the slider, the function is called, which will print the current value of <b> x</b>/
If we pass<b> True</b> or <b>False</b>, interact will generate a check box:

    >>> Booleans generate check-boxes
    interact(f,x=True);

If we pass a string, <b>interact</b> will generate a text area.

    >>> #Strings generate text areas
    interact(f,x='Hi There!');
    
<b>interact</b> can also be used as a decorator. This allows us to define a function and interact with it
in a single shot.
Following example shows that <b>interact</b> also works with function that have multiple arguments.

    >>> #Using a decorator:
    @interact(x=True, y=1,0)
    def g(x,y):
        return (x,y)

## Fixing arguments using fixed
There are times when we may want to explore a function using <b>interact</b>, but fix one or more of its 
arguments to specific values. This can be accomplished by wrapping values with the <b>fixed</b> function.

    >>> #Again, a simple function
    def h(p,q):
        return (p,q)
When we call <b>interact</b>, we pass <b>fixed(20)</b> for q to hold it fixed at a value of 20.

    >>> interact(h,p=5, q=fixed(20));
    (13,20)
A slider is only produced for p when the value of q is fixed.

## Widget abbreviations

When you pass an integer-valued keyword argument of 10 (x=10) to interact, it generates an integer-valued 
slider control with a range of [−10,+3×10].
In this case, 10 is an abbreviation for an actual slider widget:
    IntSlider(min=-10, max=30, step=1,value=10)
We can get the same result if we pass this <b>IntSlider</b> as the keyword argument for x:
    >>> #We can call the IntSlider to get more specific
    interact(f, x=widgets.IntSlider(min=-10, max=30, step=1, value=10));
    
This examples clarifies how <b>interact</b> process its keyword arguments:
1. If the keyword argument is a Widget instance with a value attribute, that widget is used. Any widget with 
a value attribute can be used, even custom ones.
2. Otherwise, the value is treated as a widget abbreviation that is converted to a widger before it is used.

## Using functions annotations with interact

We will define a function with a checkbox widget abbrevation for the argument <b>x</b>.

    >>> def f(x:True):
        return x
 Then, becaue the widget abbreviation has already been defined, we can call interact with a single argument.
    >>> interact(f);
    
### Interactive
In addition to interact, IPython provides another function, interactive, that is useful when we want to reuse 
the widgets that are produced or access the data that is bound to the UI controls.

Here is a function that returns sum of its two arguments.
    >>> def f(a,b):
        return a+b

Unlike <b>interact</b>, <b>interactive</b> return a <b>widget</b> instance rather than immediately displaying the widget.

    >>> w = interactive(f,a=10,b=20)
The widget is a <b>Box</b>, which is a container for other widgets.

To actually display the widgets, we can use the iPython's <b>display</b> function.

    >>> from IPython.display import display
    display(w)
    
At this point, the UI controls work just like they would if <b>interact</b> had been used. We can manipulate them interactively and the function will be called. However, the widget instance returned by <b>interactive</b> also give us access to the current keyword arguments and return value of the underlying Python function.

Here are the current keyword arguments. If you return this cell after manipulating the sliders, the values will have changed.
    >>> w.kwargs
    
Here is the current return value of the function.
    >>> w.result
