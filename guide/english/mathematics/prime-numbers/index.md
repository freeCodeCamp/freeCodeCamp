## Prime Numbers

A prime number is any number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 or itself. If it can be divided by another number, then it is a composite number.

Examples:

5 is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by itself(5), and 1.

12 is a not a prime number as it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

The first ten prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
