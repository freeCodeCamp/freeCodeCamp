## PI

`PI = π= 3.14159265359`

PI is a mathematical constant whose value is approximately equal to 3.14159265359. It is defined as the `ratio of circumference of a circle to its diameter`. The PI is represented by a greek letter `π` and is widely used in Physics and Mathematics.

The ratio π= circumference/diameter always remains the same, regardless of the size of a circle. For example, even if we take a new circle of twice the diameter of a previous circle, then the circumference of that new circle will be exactly double of the previous one preserving the value of π to be constant.
