## E Constant

The E constant, named after Leonhard Euler, is equal to the value:
2.718281828
e is the base of the Natural Logarithms, and this kind of math is applicable in many areas of mathematics and physics, and any natural logarithm, if you are to encounter one, is solved similarly to any other logarithm.

But why does "e" matter? 
E is a constant which we can use to observe the behavior of exponential functions. E^x resembles many other exponential curves.
Furthermore, the inverse of e^x is ln(x), the base logarithmic function. 
OF particular importance, ln(e) = 1.

The domain of y=e^x is (-infinity,infinity).
