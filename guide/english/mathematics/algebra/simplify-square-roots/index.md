## Simplify Square Roots
In order to simplify square roots, it is important to know the radical product property.

The Radical Product Property shows us that the square root of two numbers multiplied together is equivalent to the square root of the first number multiplied by the square root of the second.

The second important thing to know is the concept of Perfect Squares. When a whole number is multiplied by itself, a Perfect Square is the result.

A square root can be simplified if the number you are trying to take the square root of has a factor that is a perfect square. If it does, the Radical Product Property can be used to simplify. Examples below simplify the square root of 48 and simplify the square root of 75.
