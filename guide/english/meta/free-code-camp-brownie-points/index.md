title: Free Code Camp Brownie Points
---
The number beside your picture on Free Code Camp tells you how many Brownie Points you have. 

![A user profile picture next to a with Brownie Points score](//discourse-user-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/a/aa0c6b56b3b0d4f3acd63212b5e737fdcdd75729.png)

There are two ways you can get Brownie Points:

1.  Complete challenges - you get one point per challenge you complete
2.  Help other campers in the gitter chatroom - each time you help another camper and they thank you (by typing "thanks <span class="mention">@yourname</span>"), you will get a point.

> Brownie Points help you look like the kind of person who codes a lot, shares relevant links, and helps people.
