## Color and Culture in Visual Design


Color contributes to and affects context.
Feng shui accepts this principle, whether a contemporary home decor strategy of the West, or as part of a traditional Chinese practice.
From this, who could disagree with the premise that culture and psychology affect how colors are interpreted in context of information?
Specific combinations of colors may also represent symbols, as in colors of a national flag, a favorite sports team, school or institution for example.


Colors are one of the first impressions a viewer recognizes and interprets in communication --before letters are read, numbers analyzed, and graphs interpreted.
This is why it is important to research about [biases that viewers](/working-in-tech/unconscious-bias/index.md) may have.
A pallet of colors may change the context and meaning of content you publish.
