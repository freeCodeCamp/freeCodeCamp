## Usability Testing

Usability testing allows a designer to evaluate how real users interact with their designs. Designers will uncover areas of the design which frustrate or confuse users the most, and these issues can be prioritized. Designers will also uncover highlights within the design, where users are pleasantly surprised or delighted.

Usability tests are designed around scenarios that the designers envision to be "typical" scenarios. These scenarios will include tasks, which are concrete actions that can be done with the design. Tasks should directly correlate to the target users' actual goals. Designers should take care not to bias users through the wording of situations or tasks.

Usability tests are usually designed around a "think-aloud protocol" technique, where a user will dictate their actions and thoughts as they interact with the design.

Designers should pay attention to the following potential issues:

1) The user understands the task, but can't complete it in time
2) The user expresses surprise or delight
3) The user expresses frustration or confusion
4) The user indicates something that doesn't make sense to them
5) The user suggests a change to the design

It is also important to keep in mind that with more participants, more issues will be discovered through usability testing. It may also be beneficial to record participants' faces and audio, as well as the screen and any finger presses within a mobile application, if applicable.
