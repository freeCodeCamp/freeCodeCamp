## Extreme Programming

Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.<sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>1</a></sup>

The basic advantage of XP is that the whole process is visible and accountable. The developers will make concrete commitments about what they will accomplish, show concrete progress in the form of deployable software, and when a milestone is reached they will describe exactly what they did and how and why that differed from the plan. This allows business-oriented people to make their own business commitments with confidence, to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, and eliminate dead-ends quickly and cheaply.<sup><a href='http://wiki.c2.com/?ExtremeProgramming' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>2</a></sup>

By working along with the concept of pair programming, the quality of the code is assured since there is always two people working together and helping each other out. 

To be more adaptive and captivate their clients, extreme programming is based on releasing regularly new working versions. This allows to have a working system very early on where additions can be made any time.
