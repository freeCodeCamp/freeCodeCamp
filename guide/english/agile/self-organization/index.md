## Self Organization


In order to maintain high dynamics and agility of developed projects, all team members should mindfully share responsibility for the product that is being developed.

Vertically oriented organisational structures proved themself to be slow and inflexible with many levels of decision making. If a team wants to act fast and react dynamically to constantly changing environment, the organisational structure needs to be flat with members feeling strongly responsible for their input into the project.

It does not mean that management is an obsolete process in an agile self-organised team. It just has a different characteristic than in the traditional approach (especially in large organisations, but not only), proving to be more effective when more supportive and advisory than despotic and direct.

Foundation of self-organisation is trust and commitment of team's members.

Scrum teams are said to be self organising. This means that the work done and generally the way it is done is left up to the team to decide - they are empowered by their managers to guide themselves in the ways that makes them most effective. The members of the team (Delivery Team, Product Owner, and Scrum Master) regularly inspect their behaviors to continuously improve. 

During Sprint Planning, the team will look at the product backlog (which will have been prioritised by the product owner) and decide which stories they will work on in the upcoming sprint, and the tasks which will need completing to mark the story as Done. The team will estimate a score or size for the story to denote effort. 

During a sprint, it is up to the members of the team to pick up sprint backlog stories to work on. Generally, they will pick ones they think they can achieve. Due to it being a self organising team, there should be no assigning a task to a team member by someone else.
