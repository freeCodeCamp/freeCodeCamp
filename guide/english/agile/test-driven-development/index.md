## Test Driven Development

Test Driven Development (TDD) is one of Agile Software Development approaches. It is based on the concept that
> you must write a test case for your code even before you write the code

Here, we write a unit test first and then write the code to pass the test successfully. 

It is basically composed of 4 steps:

 - Write a test case, expecting it to initially fail.
 - See the test fail (Red)
 - Make the test pass, comitting whatever crimes in the process (Green)
 - Refactor the code to be up to standards (Refactor)

These steps follow the principle of *Red-Green-Refactor*. For the *Red-Green* steps, make sure that you write the simplest code possible to solve the problem and when *Refactoring*, ensure that it follows *Clean Code* principles.

Each new feature of your system should follow the steps above.
