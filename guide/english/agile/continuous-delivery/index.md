## Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery (CD) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.<sup><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>1</a></sup>

It aims at building, testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The approach helps reduce the cost, time, and risk of delivering changes by allowing for more incremental updates to applications in production. A straightforward and repeatable deployment process is important for continuous delivery. Continuous delivery means that the team ensures every change can be deployed to production but may choose not to do it, usually due to business reasons.
