## Business Value

Business Value is the focus of agile delivery. The agile team is charged with evaluating the business value of all work.

Business value describes what the customer will get for a specific piece of work.

This value is discovered through conversations with the customer and analysis of the work involved. Business stakeholders may have data that quantifies the value of a given feature that has been requested. A product owner will use the various sources of information available and devote significant time to understanding, evaluating, and prioritizing the value the customer will receive for a given piece of work. 

The development team uses story points for effort, the business partners, users, and stakeholders can use story points to assess business value. Using a relative story pointing exercise, they can choose a story that they all agree is of average importance, then compare the remaining stories to determine their value (lower, higher, the same).
