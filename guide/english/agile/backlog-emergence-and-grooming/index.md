## Backlog Emergence and Refinement

Product backlog refinement is an ongoing process that needs to be in sync with the product discovery process. Generally, a Scrum team will collaboratively refine product backlog items for the next two to three sprints.

A product owner (individual responsible for clarifying a sprint's goal) defines the scope of the upcoming sprints by identifying and triaging the most valuable user stories in the product backlog. A product owner is more than a glorified project manager of the product backlog, and performs more roles than simply user stories on behalf of stakeholders.

From the Scrum Guide:
Product Backlog refinement is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. This is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised.

The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion. The objective of refinement is to have enough Product Backlog items "Ready" for the next Sprint's Sprint Planning. Generally, a scrum team will collaboratively refine product backlog items for the next two to three sprints.

Backlog emergence and refinement are essential tasks for every scrum team. The Product Owner defines the scope of the upcoming sprints by identifying and triaging the most valuable user stories in the product backlog. Although the Product Owner is in charge of keeping the product backlog at peak value delivery, they need the assistance of the entire Scrum Team to do so. Changing the Sprint Backlog is part of the ongoing Sprint and is not considered Refinement.
