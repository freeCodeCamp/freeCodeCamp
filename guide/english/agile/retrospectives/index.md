## Retrospectives

The Sprint Retrospective can really be the most useful and important of the scrum ceremonies.

The concept of *"Inspect and Adapt"* is crucial to creating a successful and thriving team.  The last of the Agile Principles states that at regular intervals, the Agile team will reflect on ways to be more effective, and tune and adjust its behaviour accordingly.  So the goal of the retrospective is to reflect on the previous iteration or work period and come up with tangible items that the team can act upon that may yield some improvement.    

In iterative methodologies such as Scrum, the retrospective should be held at the end, or a day or two after the end of the iteration.  In continuous methodologies such as Kanban, the retrospective should be held in regular increments that are long enough to generate feedback, but not so long that the issues and discoveries that should be noted for improvement are forgotten.   

There are many ways to run a retrospective, but they are typically centered around a series of questions posed to the team, to encourage thoughtful reflection.  

* What should we keep doing?
* What should we stop doing?
* What should we start doing?
* Who do we want to say thank you to? (Not necessary but good practice)

Or: 

* What went well and why?  (We should keep doing these things)
* What could we have done better?  (We should stop doing or change these things)
* What have we learned?  (We should start doing these things)

It can be a good idea to reframe the questions occassionally as they can help spur different thought patterns and lead to better and more creative answers.  

The team is encouraged to provide their thoughts on these questions, discuss them, and come to an agreement on specific actions that they will commit to work on to improve their effectiveness.  

When commiting to action items, make sure you focus on 1 - 3. It is better to get a couple done, than commiting to more and not doing them. If it is difficult to come up with actions, try running experiments: Write down what you will do and what you want to achieve with that. In the following retro check if what you did achieved what you had planned. If it did not - you can learn out of the experiment and try out something else. 

A good approach to find out which topics should be discussed is *"Discuss and mention"*. It consists on a board with as many columns as people in the team (you can use something like Trello or just a regular whiteboard) and two more for the things to "discuss" and those to be "mentioned". Everybody has 10 minutes to fill their column with things from the last sprint they want to highlight (these are represented with cards or Post-it's). Afterwards, each team member explains each of their own items. Finally, each team member chooses which topics they think should be mentioned or discussed, by moving the card/post-it to the respectively column. The team then decides which topics should be discussed and talk about them for about 10 minutes.

Invite the scrum team only to the Retrospective. (Delivery Team, Product Owner, Scrum Master). Discourage managers, stakeholders, business partners, etc. They are a distraction and can hinder the sense of openness the team needs.  Retros should be honest and open.  Issues from within the team can be difficult to discuss.  The Agile Coach or Scrum Master should act as the guide, facilitator and mediator to encourage productive discussion without finger-pointing or ganging up.    

When conducting a retrospective make sure that in the first 5 - 10 minutes everyone says at least a couple of words. When team members speak up in the beginning of the meeting, it is more likely that they contribute during the whole meeting.

During the retrospective it is important that the team stays productive. A simple way to keep people in a positive mood is to focus on what is in the control of the team.

- For a co-located team, index cards and post-its work great for this process.
- For distributed teams, there are a variety of online tools and apps to facilitate the discussion

Action items should be notated on a board to make tracking progress visual and more distinguishable. Every new retrospective should start with reviewing the status of the action items decided upon during the *previous* restrospective.
