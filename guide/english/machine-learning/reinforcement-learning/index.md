Reinforcement Learning refers to a field of Machine Learning that applies to agents that you reinforce by giving them reward and punishment. It gives a nice gradual learning and can simplify the learning of agent in tasks where you cannot determine a proper error value.

Example:
A bot is given a task to play Space Invaders, it tries to learn to play it by interacting with game and in return getting a reward for the points that it scored at end of the game. Greater the reward, greater are its chances of doing the similar gameplay. In that way, it learns how to play the game and perform in the best possible way.

In industries robot uses deep reinforcement learning to pick a device from one box and putting it in a container. Whether it succeeds or fails, it memorizes the object and gains knowledge and train’s itself to do this job with great speed and precision. Learning on its own is a kind of reinforcement learning provided the learning is in positive dimension.

The best example, and one which you will hear a lot in this field, is AlphaGo developed by Google. This uses reinforcement learning to learn the patterns, rules and semantics of the board game, Go. This bot defeated the World No. 1 Go player, Lee Sedol, in what was the first time a computer program defeated a professional player. AlphaGo won by 4-1 in a five game series. This was a huge victory for AI and kickstarted the field of Reinforcement learning. 

## List of Common Algorithms
Q-Learning
Temporal Difference (TD)
Deep Adversarial Networks

## Use cases:
Some applications of the reinforcement learning algorithms are computer played board games (Chess, Go), robotic hands, and self-driving cars.
