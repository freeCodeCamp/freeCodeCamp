## Perceptron

A perceptron is a single layered neural network. It consists of single neuron, which takes in a no. of parameters as input, and gives a output. It is basically a linear classifier (binary). It consists of the following parts:
1. Input Values
2. Weights and Biases for each input
3. An Activation function.
4. An output.

The fuction of the perceptron is as follows:
1. Takes in the values from the input.
2. Multiplies the values with their corresponding WEIGHTS and adds the BIASES.
3. Applies an Activation function on the acquired result.
4. Returns the final value as output.

So for some given input and their corresponding output, the network is able to learn these predictions through adjusting the values of the Weights and the Biases, during the training period.
