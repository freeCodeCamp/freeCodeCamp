---

Here’s the Wikipedia definition:

A mobile application (or mobile app) is a software application designed to run on smartphones, tablet computers and other mobile devices.

So pretty straightforward then? Not quite.
The history of the mobile app begins, obviously, with the history of the mobile device and the first mobile phones whose microchips required the most basic of software to send and receive voice calls. But since then things have got a lot more complicated.
A mobile application or mobile app is a software application. Basically, it is a computer generated program designed and developed to run on iPhone, Smartphones, tablets and many other mobile devices. Without doubt, the world has accepted the fact that apps are the way to get the most of the smartphones. So, it will be riveting to trace the history markups for the mobile apps development.

### Where Did It All Start?
On the 3rd day of April 1973, the first mobile phone call was made by Martin Cooper of Motorola to Dr. Joel S. Engel of Bell Labs. That device or instrument weighed 1.1 kg and measuring (23 x 13 x 4.45) cm. And, it took two decades of Research and development (R&D) to get first mobile application for smartphones, and the credit goes to IBM Simon, who introduced the world with the first mobile apps for smart phones.

### What Makes Mobile Apps So Popular?
Most people have smart phones and iPhones today, so apps are easy to access and simply make your life better as a result. There are millions of mobile apps at present. For examples, apps for social networks, travel, health, banking, fitness, calendars, games, news and much more. The Apple App store adds more than 20,000 apps every month.

### Mobile App Development Timeline 
Mobile application development is not only the leading business of today, but it is also the bread earner for many individuals across the globe. Take WhatsApp; this small app was developed and revolutionized the global communication, and is now part of the biggest and arguably the most popular social network while at the same time has rewarded its owners with millions of dollars. What business owners fail to realize when asking an app development industry are the timelines that should be minded by both the parties for the app development. Through this article, we intend to clarify the misconceptions clients have with the application development process. App development is not a child’s game; it requires a significant amount of critical thinking, research, and market analysis prior to development. All this takes time.

### How can you start making apps?
There are many tools at your disposal from which you can start making your own apps. The most popular is Android Studio which uses Java and XML. XCode lets you create apps for iOS. But these apps require good amount of programming knowledge. For all the beginners out there, MIT AppInventor 2 comes to the rescue. With simple block-based programming you can easily code and publish apps for others.
