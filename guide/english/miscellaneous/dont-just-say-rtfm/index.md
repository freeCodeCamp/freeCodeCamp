## Don't Just Say Rtfm
RTFM comments generally useless

**"RTFM"** is **rude**, no doubt about it. However, **links to the manual in comments are perfectly acceptable**, and sometimes the only appropriate response to a question.

It can happen that the person reading the product or something related to the article didn't find the manual and we say RTFM, it can be bad for him and can hurt his/her feelings.
Also, it is better to "Be Nice" and use "Polite" words in order to make him read and understand the manual system.

So when posting a manual link, be smart. **Drop the RTFM and use nicer wording** so the link survives. Suggestions:

*   Check out the manual page: (link)
*   See the manual: (link)
*   This is explained in the manual: (link)

If the OP was really lazy:

*   Your question is answered in the manual: (link) For future reference, please always remember to look in the manual first. Thanks!

And the person didn't looked in the manual then: 

*   You can ask your question in the Contact menu (link).
