title: Advantages of Using Free Code Camp
---
Free Code Camp's main advantage is that we're accessible to busy adults who want to change careers.

Specifically, we're:

*   Free
*   Self-paced
*   Browser-based

One of the most noticeable differences in this curriculum compared to other Code-Camp/School environments is the **high level of support**: Using the chat-rooms for help, guidance, and assisting fellow coders gives you a better understanding of the code, easier access to explanations, and it's in real-time so you can question the confusion.
