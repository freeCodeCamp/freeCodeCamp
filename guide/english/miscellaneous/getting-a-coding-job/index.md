## Here are the facts:

*   There are hundreds of thousands of unfilled coding jobs.
*   Employers and the US government have joined together to promote nontraditional coding programs like Free Code Camp.
*   Full stack JavaScript and Swift are two of the best paying skill sets, and have a ton of job openings.
*   The best proof that you're an employable developer is a portfolio filled with real apps that real people are using.

You'll still need to develop basic interviewing skills and soft skills (if you've been working a knowledge-worker type job for a few years, you probably already have these).

You'll also need to work hard to network with coders in your city. You can do this by joining <a href='https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/LocalGroups-List' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>your city's Local Group</a> and participating in as many events as possible.

I've found <a href='https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>this</a> link to be useful. It does a great job of explaining the process.

## Pro tip

- Like in any other industry or field, the hardest part is actually getting started. Do not worry too much and take action instead - the results will be mesmerizing.
- Also, if you're new to coding, don't immediately focus on your salary, but focus on finding a job where you can improve your coding skills and up your game. The rest will follow.

## Remote Coding Jobs

Of those hundreds of thousands of coding jobs out there, there is a growing number that are remote. In fact, there are quite a bit of remote coding jobs out there. Remote offers companies the opportunity to find the best fit for their position without being geographically limited. Similarly remote jobs opens up opportunities for you that may not be available locally or even in the same timezone.
