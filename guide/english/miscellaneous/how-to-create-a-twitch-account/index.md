title: How to Create a Twitch Account

# What is Twitch?

Twitch is a live streaming video platform that was founded in June 2011. More than 2 million people broadcast on Twitch each month with over 100 million unique visitors.

## Setting up your Twitch Account

Creating an account with Twitch enables you to interact with chat, get alerts when someone you know streams and maybe even stream yourself.

1.  Click here to [create a new account](https://www.twitch.tv/signup).

2.  You should now choose an appropriate username and password.

1.  Then submit your date of birth and your email address.

> It's important that you provide a correct email address as you will need this later to verify your account and get alerts when someone goes live.

1.  Now all you need to do is complete the captcha and you're ready to rock!

2.  Once you have signed up, you will receive an email regarding verifying your account.

### Changing some Settings

Once you've logged in, go to the [settings page](https://www.twitch.tv/settings).

On this page you can change your profile picture, email address and write a bio. Unfortunately, Twitch doesn't allow you to change your username once you've signed up. However, you can change the capitalization.

## Following FreeCodeCamp

### We are currently moving away from using Twitch, we will update this page once details have been finalized.

### Watching past broadcasts

If we aren't live, you can watch some of our previous streams. Past broadcasts are only saved for 14 days after they are originally streamed, so bare that in mind.
