## Elixir

Elixir is a dynamic, functional programming language built to run on the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM). Elixir is known for being a concurrent and general purpose language that is often leveraged with the powerful Phoenix framework. This language was created by José Valim, and has been influenced by languages like Ruby, Erlang, and Closure.
