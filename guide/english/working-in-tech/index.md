## Working in Tech and IT

A wide variety of technology-related fields such as web development, design, data science, infrastructure support, information security, and product management are often lumped into the catch-all term "tech" or IT. 

This section will focus on additional career challenges faced by under-represented minorities and people from non-traditional education backgrounds. Specific topis will include sexism and ageism, which have been particularly prevalent in certain industries and organizations. 

### Computer Security

The field of computer security is growing at a rapid rate every year. A recent report estimates that by 2021, 3.5 million jobs in computer security will be unfilled. The demand is due to the ever-increasing amount of valuable data being created every day that must be kept safe and secure from cyber attacks.
