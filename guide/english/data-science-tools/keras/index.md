## You have just found simple way to implement deeplearning tools

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [CNTK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cntk), or [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano). It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. *Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.*

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

- Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

Read the documentation at [Keras.io](https://keras.io).

Keras is compatible with: Python 2.7 +.

With keras you can implement different API and deeplearning tools just by writing few lines which is crazy its like you a magic wond in your hand.
