### Build Error

```markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes but it looks like there is an error with the Travis CI build. ⚠️

Once you resolve these issues, We will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

```

### Syncing Fork

> When PR is not up to date with the `master` branch.

Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes but it looks like there is an error with the Travis CI build. ⚠️

```bash
Error: ENOTDIR: not a directory, open 'src/pages/java/data-abstraction/index.md'
``````

This particular error was not caused by your file but was an old error caused by merging faulty code to the `master` branch. It has since been resolved.

To pass the build, you will have to sync the latest changes from the `master` branch of the `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp` repo.

Using the command line, you can do this in three easy steps:

```bash
git remote add upstream git://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git

git fetch upstream

git pull upstream master
```

If you're using a GUI, you can simply `Add a new remote...` and use the link `git://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git` from above.

Once you sync your fork and pass the build, We will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

> When PR has merge conflicts that need to be resolved.¹

```markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes but it looks like you have some merge conflicts. ⚠️

### Duplicate

```markdown
Hey @username

It seems that similar changes have already been accepted earlier for this article you are editing, sorry about that. 😓
