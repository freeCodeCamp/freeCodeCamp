### I am new to GitHub and Open Source. Where should I start?

Read our ["How to Contribute to Open Source Guide"](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source). It's a comprehensive reference for first-timer-friendly projects. And it includes a lot of open source contribution tips.

### What do I need to know to contribute to the codebase?

freeCodeCamp runs on a modern JavaScript stack. If you're interested in contributing to our codebase, you will need some familiarity with JavaScript and some of the technologies we use like Node.js, MongoDB, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, and Webpack.

### Can I translate freeCodeCamp's resources?

Yes - You can contribute to any of the 30+ languages we have enabled on our translation platform.

We have user-contributed translations live in some languages. We intend to localize freeCodeCamp into several major world languages. You can read all about this in our [announcement here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/help-translate-freecodecamp-language/).

如果你對參與翻譯貢獻有興趣，請務必首先[閱讀本指南](how-to-translate-files.md)。

### Can I contribute articles to freeCodeCamp News or videos to freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel?

Yes - you can contribute to our publication blog and YouTube channel.

### 我如何報告一個新的 bug？

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["How to Report a Bug"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-report-a-bug-to-freecodecamp/) article and follow its instructions.

如果你確信這是一個新的bug，請創建一個新的 GitHub issue。 請務必包含儘可能多的信息，以便我們能夠重現 bug。 我們有預設的 issue 模版來幫助你提交 GitHub issue。

請注意，這些 GitHub issues 僅爲了代碼庫相關的問題和討論，而不是爲了獲得編程學習方面的幫助。 當你有疑問時，應該在創建一個 GitHub issue 前[在論壇上尋求幫助](https://forum.freecodecamp.org)。

### 我如何報告一個安全問題？

請不要爲安全問題來創建 GitHub issue。 反之，請 [遵循我們的安全政策](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/security)。

### 我是一名學生。 我可以爲學術學分參與一個功能開發嗎？

可以的。 請注意，我們無法承諾你的學院或大學可能要求的任何時間表或文書工作。 我們收到了許多來自於志願開發者的推送請求以及代碼貢獻，並且我們尊重他們的時間與勞動。 出於對我們所有其他貢獻者的尊重，我們不會僅僅因爲與學校有關而給予任何優先考慮。

我們請求你提前計劃，並在貢獻代碼時知曉這一點。

### 這些不同的在問題上標籤意味着什麼？

代碼維護人員會根據優先級、嚴重程度和其他因素對 issue 和 pull request 進行[分類](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management)。  你可以在這裏找到[其含義的完整詞彙表](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels).

### 如果我想就一個問題開展工作，我將從哪裏開始？

你應該瀏覽標註有 [**`help wanted`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) 或 [**`first timers only`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22first+timers+only%22) 的 issue，以快速瞭解可供你貢獻的內容。

> [!TIP] **`help wanted`** issues are up for grabs, and you do not need to seek permission before working on them. 然而，具有 **`first timers only`** 標籤的 issue 是特別爲以前沒有爲 freeCodeCodeCamp 代碼庫貢獻的人設計的任務。

### I found a typo. Should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without creating an issue first. Please be sure to mention details in the pull request description to help us understand and review your contribution – even if it's just a minor change.

Please do create an issue if you want to discuss bigger aspects of the codebase or curriculum.

### How can I get an issue assigned to me?

We typically do not assign issues to anyone other than long-time contributors. Instead, we follow the below policy to be fair to everyone:

1. We are most likely to merge the first pull request that addresses the issue.
2. In the case of multiple contributors opening a pull request for the same issue at around the same time, we will give priority to the pull request that best addresses the issue. Some of the things we consider:
   - Did you include tests?
   - 你是否考慮了所有用例？
   - 你是否確保通過所有測試，並確認所有東西在本地正常運行？
3. Finally, we give priority to pull requests which follow our recommended guidelines.
   - Did you follow the pull request checklist?
   - Did you give your pull request a meaningful title?

### I am interested in being a moderator at freeCodeCamp. Where should I start?

Our community moderators are our heroes. Their voluntary contributions make freeCodeCamp a safe and welcoming community.

First and foremost, we would need you to be an active participant in the community, and live by our [code of conduct](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/) (not just enforce it).

Here are some recommended paths for some of our platforms:

- To be a **Discord/Chat** moderator, have an active presence in our chat and have positive engagements with others, while also learning and practicing how to deal with potential conflicts that may arise.
- To be a **Forum** moderator, similar to a chat moderator, have an active presence and engage with other forum posters, supporting others in their learning journey, and even giving feedback when asked. Take a look at [The Subforum Leader Handbook](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/the-subforum-leader-handbook/326326) for more information.
- To be a **GitHub** moderator, help process GitHub issues that are brought up to see if they are valid and (ideally) try to propose solutions for these issues to be picked up by others (or yourself).

Altogether, be respectful to others. 我們是來自世界各地的人。 With that in mind, please also consider using encouraging or supportive language and be mindful of cross-cultural communication.

If you practice the above **consistently for a while** and our fellow moderator members recommend you, a staff member will reach out and onboard you to the moderators' team. Open source work is voluntary work and our time is limited. We acknowledge that this is probably true in your case as well. So we emphasize being **consistent** rather than engaging in the community 24/7.

Take a look at our [Moderator Handbook](moderator-handbook.md) for a more exhaustive list of other responsibilities and expectations we have of our moderators.

### I am stuck on something that is not included in this documentation.

**Feel free to ask for help in:**

- The `Contributors` category of [our community forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/contributors).
- The `#Contributors` channel on [our chat server](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay).

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. If you ask us questions on the related issue threads, we will be glad to clarify. Be sure to search for your question before posting a new one.

Thanks in advance for being polite and patient. Remember – this community is run mainly by volunteers.
