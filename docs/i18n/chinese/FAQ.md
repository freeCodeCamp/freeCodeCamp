### I am new to GitHub and Open Source. Where should I start?

Read our ["How to Contribute to Open Source Guide"](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source). It's a comprehensive reference for first-timer-friendly projects. And it includes a lot of open source contribution tips.

### What do I need to know to contribute to the codebase?

freeCodeCamp runs on a modern JavaScript stack. If you're interested in contributing to our codebase, you will need some familiarity with JavaScript and some of the technologies we use like Node.js, MongoDB, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, and Webpack.

### Can I translate freeCodeCamp's resources?

Yes - You can contribute to any of the 30+ languages we have enabled on our translation platform.

We have user-contributed translations live in some languages. We intend to localize freeCodeCamp into several major world languages. You can read all about this in our [announcement here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/help-translate-freecodecamp-language/).

如果你对参与翻译贡献有兴趣，请务必首先[阅读本指南](how-to-translate-files.md)。

### Can I contribute articles to freeCodeCamp News or videos to freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel?

Yes - you can contribute to our publication blog and YouTube channel.

如果你有兴趣为 freeCodeCamp News 撰写文章，请访问此 [专栏写作指南](https://www.freecodecamp.org/chinese/news/developer-news-style-guide/)。 In addition, please read our [style guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-news-style-guide/) as this will help you write stronger and more effective articles.

### 我如何报告一个新的 bug？

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["How to Report a Bug"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-report-a-bug-to-freecodecamp/) article and follow its instructions.

如果你确信这是一个新的bug，请创建一个新的 GitHub issue。 请务必包含尽可能多的信息，以便我们能够重现 bug。 我们有预设的 issue 模版来帮助你提交 GitHub issue。

请注意，这些 GitHub issues 仅为了代码库相关的问题和讨论，而不是为了获得编程学习方面的帮助。 当你有疑问时，应该在创建一个 GitHub issue 前[在论坛上寻求帮助](https://forum.freecodecamp.org)。

### 我如何报告一个安全问题？

请不要为安全问题来创建 GitHub issue。 反之，请 [遵循我们的安全政策](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/security)。

### 我是一名学生。 我可以为学术学分参与一个功能开发吗？

可以的。 请注意，我们无法承诺你的学院或大学可能要求的任何时间表或文书工作。 我们收到了许多来自于志愿开发者的推送请求以及代码贡献，并且我们尊重他们的时间与劳动。 出于对我们所有其他贡献者的尊重，我们不会仅仅因为与学校有关而给予任何优先考虑。

我们请求你提前计划，并在贡献代码时知晓这一点。

### 这些不同的在问题上标签意味着什么？

代码维护人员会根据优先级、严重程度和其他因素对 issue 和 pull request 进行[分类](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management)。  你可以在这里找到[其含义的完整词汇表](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels).

### 如果我想就一个问题开展工作，我将从哪里开始？

你应该浏览标注有 [**`help wanted`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) 或 [**`first timers only`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22first+timers+only%22) 的 issue，以快速了解可供你贡献的内容。

> [!TIP] **`help wanted`** issues are up for grabs, and you do not need to seek permission before working on them. 然而，具有 **`first timers only`** 标签的 issue 是特别为以前没有为 freeCodeCodeCamp 代码库贡献的人设计的任务。

### I found a typo. Should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without creating an issue first. Please be sure to mention details in the pull request description to help us understand and review your contribution – even if it's just a minor change.

Please do create an issue if you want to discuss bigger aspects of the codebase or curriculum.

### How can I get an issue assigned to me?

We typically do not assign issues to anyone other than long-time contributors. Instead, we follow the below policy to be fair to everyone:

1. We are most likely to merge the first pull request that addresses the issue.
2. In the case of multiple contributors opening a pull request for the same issue at around the same time, we will give priority to the pull request that best addresses the issue. Some of the things we consider:
   - Did you include tests?
   - 你是否考虑了所有用例？
   - 你是否确保通过所有测试，并确认所有东西在本地正常运行？
3. Finally, we give priority to pull requests which follow our recommended guidelines.
   - Did you follow the pull request checklist?
   - Did you give your pull request a meaningful title?

### I am interested in being a moderator at freeCodeCamp. Where should I start?

Our community moderators are our heroes. Their voluntary contributions make freeCodeCamp a safe and welcoming community.

First and foremost, we would need you to be an active participant in the community, and live by our [code of conduct](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/) (not just enforce it).

Here are some recommended paths for some of our platforms:

- To be a **Discord/Chat** moderator, have an active presence in our chat and have positive engagements with others, while also learning and practicing how to deal with potential conflicts that may arise.
- To be a **Forum** moderator, similar to a chat moderator, have an active presence and engage with other forum posters, supporting others in their learning journey, and even giving feedback when asked. Take a look at [The Subforum Leader Handbook](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/the-subforum-leader-handbook/326326) for more information.
- To be a **GitHub** moderator, help process GitHub issues that are brought up to see if they are valid and (ideally) try to propose solutions for these issues to be picked up by others (or yourself).

Altogether, be respectful to others. 我们是来自世界各地的人。 With that in mind, please also consider using encouraging or supportive language and be mindful of cross-cultural communication.

If you practice the above **consistently for a while** and our fellow moderator members recommend you, a staff member will reach out and onboard you to the moderators' team. Open source work is voluntary work and our time is limited. We acknowledge that this is probably true in your case as well. So we emphasize being **consistent** rather than engaging in the community 24/7.

Take a look at our [Moderator Handbook](moderator-handbook.md) for a more exhaustive list of other responsibilities and expectations we have of our moderators.

### I am stuck on something that is not included in this documentation.

**Feel free to ask for help in:**

- The `Contributors` category of [our community forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/contributors).
- The `#Contributors` channel on [our chat server](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay).

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. If you ask us questions on the related issue threads, we will be glad to clarify. Be sure to search for your question before posting a new one.

Thanks in advance for being polite and patient. Remember – this community is run mainly by volunteers.
