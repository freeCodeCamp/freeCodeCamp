## Erro de compilação

```markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes but it looks like there is an error with the CI build. ⚠️

Once you resolve these issues, we will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

---

Feel free to reference the [contributing guidelines](how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md#testing-challenges) for instructions on running the CI build locally. ✅

## Sincronização de forks

> Quando um PR não está atualizado com a branch `main`.

````markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes, but it looks like the branch is not up to date. ⚠️

To resolve this error, you will have to sync the latest changes from the `main` branch of the `freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp` repo.

Using the command line, you can do this in three easy steps:

```bash
git remote add upstream git://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git

git fetch upstream

git pull upstream main
```

If you're using a GUI, you can simply `Add a new remote...` and use the link `git://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp.git` from above.

Once you sync your fork and pass the build, we will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

Feel free to reference the ["Syncing a fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) article on GitHub for more insight on how to keep your fork up-to-date with the upstream repository. 🔄

## Conflitos ao fazer o merge
> Quando um PR tem conflitos de merge isso precisa ser resolvido.¹

```markdown
Hey @username

We would love to be able to merge your changes, but it looks like you have some merge conflicts. ⚠️

Once you resolve these conflicts, we will be able to review your PR and merge it. 😊

---

If you're not familiar with the merge conflict process, feel free to look over GitHub's guide on ["Resolving a merge conflict"](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github/). 🔍️

Also, it's good practice on GitHub to write a brief description of your changes when creating a PR. 📝
```

¹ Se é a primeira vez de um colaborador e se ele tem um conflito de merge, os mantenedores resolverão o conflito para ele.

## Duplicado

> Quando um PR é duplo ou repetitivo.

If you feel you have additional changes to expand upon this PR, please feel free to push your commits and request this PR be reopened.

## Adicionando comentário sobre erros de iniciante

```markdown
Hi there, 

Thanks for creating this pull request.

Please ensure you follow the PR checklist and not just tick things off; otherwise, we won't take you seriously. Respect the requirements to earn the respect of your fellow maintainers. You will also save everyone time :)

Since you are new here, please slow down and read our [contributing guidelines](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org), as we see that you may still need to catch up on a few things.

<details>
<summary>Here are some examples (expand)</summary>

1. Do not edit files directly on GitHub – while you can, it's not a good idea. 

   Typos and formatting errors can break the tests.

2. Use the correct way to link issues. 

   Add the issue number only in the description of the PR by updating the `XXXXXX`. Do not just add issue numbers everywhere and anywhere you feel like.

4. Keep mentions and review requests to a minimum. 

   We understand you are excited about contributing, and our maintainers will get back to you when they can.

5. Do not work directly off your `main` branch. 

   You can always create a new branch for the changes you are working on. That way, you can sync change to your PR branch as the main repository moves ahead while your PR is waiting in the merge queue.

</details>

Don't worry. You don't have to close this PR. Feel free to ask specific queries on improving your PR here; someone will guide you.

We are happy you are excited to contribute and appreciate you taking the time to help us. Looking forward to more contributions!

Happy Contributing.
```
