# Security Policy

This document outlines our security policy for the codebase, and how to report vulnerabilities.

| ----------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| production  | `prod-current` | :white_check_mark: | freecodecamp.org |
| beta        | `prod-staging` | :white_check_mark: | freecodecamp.dev |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you have found a vulnerability, _please report responsibly_. Don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

We appreciate any responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities that might impact the integrity of our platforms and users.

While we do not offer any bounties or swags at the moment, we'll be happy to list your name in our [Hall of Fame](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/security-hall-of-fame) list, provided the reports are not low-effort for example: using tools & online utilities to report SFP configurations, or SSL Server tests, etc. We consider those in the category of ["beg bounties"](https://www.troyhunt.com/beg-bounties/).

Ensure that you are using the **latest**, **stable** and **updated** version of the Operating System and Web Browser available to you on your machine.
