# Min Heap Tree Visualizer

An interactive visualization of a Min Heap using SVG.

## Why this exists

Heaps are commonly taught using array representations, which makes it difficult
for beginners to visualize the underlying tree structure. This tool bridges that gap.

## Features

- Tree-style heap visualization
- Edge connections between nodes
- Interactive insertion
- Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## How to run

Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Future improvements

- Animated heapify
- Extract min operation
- Max heap toggle
