<!-- We actually don't want the anchor elemet to link to catphotos.com. So on the achor tag, change the value of the href attribute to equal "#". This will keep the text as a link but it will no longer link to anything. This is often used to create a placeholder link or when changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript. -->
