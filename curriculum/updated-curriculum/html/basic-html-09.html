<!-- All img elements should have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load. Add an alt attribute to the image element with the text "A cute orange cat lying on its back.". For example, <img src="cat.jpg" alt="A cat."> has an alt tag with the text "A cat.". -->
