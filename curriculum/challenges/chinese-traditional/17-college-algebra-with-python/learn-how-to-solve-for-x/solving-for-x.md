# --description--

This first video will show you the essence of algebra and then how Python code does the same task in a different way.

Here is the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11Zi77gs1FKoEqfPqYa2HtTENiWZyQAO2?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Colab notebook to go along with this video.</a> Add the code from the video to your algebra Colab notebook to see how to solve for X using Python. Then change the code if you want, test it, and compare it to paper-and-pencil solving. Remember the equation input needs to be in Python syntax.
