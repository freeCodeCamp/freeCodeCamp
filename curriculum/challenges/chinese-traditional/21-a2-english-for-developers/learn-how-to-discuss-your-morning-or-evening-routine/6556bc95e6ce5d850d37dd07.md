# --description--

Adjectives are words that describe or give more information about nouns or pronouns. For example, in the phrase `the blue sky`, `blue` is an adjective describing the sky.

Notice how the adjective comes before the noun. It is `blue sky` not `sky blue`.

Expressive language can include idiomatic expressions or descriptive adjectives to communicate strong feelings or vivid ideas, like saying `sparkling eyes` to describe someone's bright, lively eyes.

Here are some more examples:

`She wakes up early every day` - `Early` describes the time of her waking up. `He has a quick shower in the morning` - `Quick` describes the short duration of the shower.
