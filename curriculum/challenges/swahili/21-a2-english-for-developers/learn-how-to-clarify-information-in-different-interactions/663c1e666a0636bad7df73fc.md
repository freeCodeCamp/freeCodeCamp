<!-- (Audio) Tom: You're on the right track. It's a kind of coffee machine. -->

# --description--

When someone says `you're on the right track` when you are answering a question, what they mean is that your answer was a good one. It was not necessarily 100% correct, but you had a good idea to answer what was being asked of you.

A `coffee machine`, you probably guessed it, is a machine used for making coffee. A `percolator` is one example of a `coffee machine`.

Listen to the sentence and fill in the blanks.
