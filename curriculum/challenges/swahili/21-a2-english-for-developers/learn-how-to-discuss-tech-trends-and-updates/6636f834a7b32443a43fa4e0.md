Lisa mentions that serverless computing makes cloud computing more convenient, not more expensive. It reduces the burden of managing servers.

---

It reduces the effectiveness of cloud computing by limiting control over servers.

### --feedback--

On the contrary, Lisa highlights that serverless computing enhances convenience, not reduces effectiveness or control.
