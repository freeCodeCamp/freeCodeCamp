AUDIO REFERENCE:
Tom: I often find function descriptions in the documentation, but I'm not sure how to interpret them. What should I focus on when reading these?

# --description--

`Interpret` means trying to understand or find the meaning of something, like figuring out what a difficult word means or what someone is trying to say. For example, `He tried to interpret the instructions as best as he could.`

`Focus` is when you pay extra attention to one specific thing, ignoring others. It's like looking through a camera and adjusting it so only one object is clear, while everything else is blurry. For example, `She decided to focus on her math homework to finish it quickly.`
