# --description--

The word `potential` refers to something that could possibly happen or exist in the future, even though it isn't certain. In programming, talking about a `potential issue` means there could be a problem with the code that might occur under certain conditions. It's not a definite problem but something that could become one.

For example, `There is a potential issue if the user enters a very large number.` This means the problem isn't happening right now, but it could happen if the situation occurs.
