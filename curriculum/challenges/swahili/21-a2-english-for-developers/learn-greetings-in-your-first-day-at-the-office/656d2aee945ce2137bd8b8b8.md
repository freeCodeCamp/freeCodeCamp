# --description--

In many security systems, a sound is used to indicate a specific action.

In this dialogue, the `click` sound means that the door has been unlocked. The term `lock` refers to securing something, usually a door or a container, so that it cannot be opened without the correct key or combination. For example, you might lock your house when you leave to keep it safe.

`Unlock` means to open a lock, allowing access. In some places, when a door is unlocked, it might make a `click` sound as an indicator.
