challengeType: 4
isRequired: true

## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/</a> and deploy it to Heroku.
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <a href='/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects'>https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects</a>.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
