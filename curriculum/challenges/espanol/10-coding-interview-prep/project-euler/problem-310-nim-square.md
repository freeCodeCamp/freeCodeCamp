# --description--

Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.

Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap.

The number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c).

If 0≤a≤b≤c≤29 then the number of losing positions for the next player is 1160.

Find the number of losing positions for the next player if 0≤a≤b≤c≤100 000.

# --hints--

`euler310()` should return 2586528661783.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler310(), 2586528661783);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler310() {

  return true;
}

euler310();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
