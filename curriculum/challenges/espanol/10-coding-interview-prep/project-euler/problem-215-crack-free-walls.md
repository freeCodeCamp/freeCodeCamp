# --description--

Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2×1 and 3×1 bricks (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

For example, the following 9×3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:

<img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="9x3 wall with one lined up gap between horizontally-adjacent bricks" src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/project-euler/crack-free-walls.gif" style="background-color: white; padding: 10px;" />

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9×3 wall, written $W(9,3) = 8$.

Calculate $W(32,10)$.

# --hints--

`crackFreeWalls()` should return `806844323190414`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(crackFreeWalls(), 806844323190414);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function crackFreeWalls() {

  return true;
}

crackFreeWalls();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
