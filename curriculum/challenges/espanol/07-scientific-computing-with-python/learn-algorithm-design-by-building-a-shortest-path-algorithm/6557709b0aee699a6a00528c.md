# --description--

Now, replace the existent keys with the strings `A` and `B` — one for each node. Then, replace each value with the string representing the node connected to the key.

# --hints--

Your dictionary should have an `A` key.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    "A" in graph
  `))
})
```

Your `A` key should have `B` as the value.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    graph["A"] == "B"
  `))
})
```

Your dictionary should have an `B` key.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    "B" in graph
  `))
})
```

Your `B` key should have `A` as the value.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    graph["B"] == "A"
  `))
})
```

Your dictionary should have two keys.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
    graph = __locals.get("my_graph")
    len(graph) == 2
  `))
})
```
