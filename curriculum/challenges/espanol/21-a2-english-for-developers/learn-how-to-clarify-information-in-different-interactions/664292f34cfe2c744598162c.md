<!-- (Audio) Maria: And for the vegetarian options, you mentioned 5 large trays of salad, but I think 3 large trays is enough. -->

# --description--

Listen to Maria and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

What can we conclude in terms of the amount of vegetarian food at the party?

## --answers--

Maria believes that there should be 5 trays of salad for the party

### --feedback--

She actually says that 3 would be enough.

---

She thinks 3 trays of salad are as much as the vegetarians in the team need

---

She will order 5 trays of salad along with the 3 they had decided to order

### --feedback--

That would be an exaggeration, since she thinks 3 trays are enough.

---

She wants to order 3 trays of chicken wings because she thinks they are enough

### --feedback--

Chicken wings were discussed previously. The discussion, now, is about the salad.
