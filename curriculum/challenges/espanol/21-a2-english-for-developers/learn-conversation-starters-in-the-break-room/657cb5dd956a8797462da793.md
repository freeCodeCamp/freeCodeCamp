# --description--

When you want to know about someone's character or personality, you can ask, `What is (he/she) like?` or `What are they like?`.

This question is about the qualities of a person, not about their physical appearance. Example:

Imagine you meet a new student in your programming class and you want to know more about her. You can ask a classmate `What is she like?`.

You are not asking if the new student likes computers or games; you are asking about her personality. Maybe she's friendly, smart, or really good at coding.
