<!-- (Audio) Sarah: It's particularly useful when you have many tasks and a limited coding team. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

For what kind of project or team is low-code development particularly useful, according to Sarah?

## --answers--

For large teams with specialized skills in coding

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Sarah points out that low-code development is more beneficial for teams with limited coding resources, not those that are large and highly specialized.

---

For projects that require extensive manual coding

### --feedback--

This is misleading; Sarah indicates that low-code development is useful specifically because it reduces the need for extensive manual coding.

---

For projects with many tasks and teams that have limited coding resources

---

For small, simple projects that require little to no coding

### --feedback--

While low-code development can be used in small projects, Sarah specifically mentions its usefulness in managing many tasks with limited coding staff, which implies more complexity.
