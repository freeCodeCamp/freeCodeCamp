<!-- (Audio) Brian: Understood. We can investigate this together, and by the end of it, we should have a clearer picture of what's happening. -->

# --description--

The word `clear` means easy to understand or see. When you want to compare something and show it is more `clear`, you add `er` at the end to make `clearer`.

For example:

- This explanation is `clear`.
- This explanation is `clearer` than the other one.

Notice how `clearer` is used to compare two things, indicating that one is more easy to understand than the other.
