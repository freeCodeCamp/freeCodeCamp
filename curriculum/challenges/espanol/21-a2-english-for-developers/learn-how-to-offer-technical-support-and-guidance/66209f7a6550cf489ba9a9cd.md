# --description--

`To handle` something means to deal with or manage it. In programming, `handling` involves managing data or operations. For example, `to handle user input means to manage what happens when a user enters data`.

`Error handling` is dealing with errors that occur when the program runs. It's about writing code that can manage these errors without crashing. For example, `using try-except blocks in Python to handle errors that might occur when a program runs`.
