# --description--

Web developers traditionally use <dfn>lorem ipsum text</dfn> as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.

Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.

Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called "kitty ipsum" text.

# --instructions--

Replace the text inside your `p` element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: `Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.`

# --hints--

Your `p` element should contain the first few words of the provided "kitty ipsum" text.

```js
assert.match(document.querySelector('p').textContent,/Kitty(\s)+ipsum/gi);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Hello Paragraph</p>
```

# --solutions--

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff</p>
```
