# --description--

`a` (*anchor*) elements can also be used to create internal links to jump to different sections within a webpage.

To create an internal link, you assign a link's `href` attribute to a hash symbol `#` plus the value of the `id` attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. You then need to add the same `id` attribute to the element you are linking to. An `id` is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.

Below is an example of an internal anchor link and its target element:

```html
<a href="#contacts-header">Contacts</a>
...
<h2 id="contacts-header">Contacts</h2>
```

When users click the `Contacts` link, they'll be taken to the section of the webpage with the **Contacts** heading element.

# --instructions--

Change your external link to an internal link by changing the `href` attribute to `#footer` and the text from `cat photos` to `Jump to Bottom`.

Remove the `target="_blank"` attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab.

Then add an `id` attribute with a value of `footer` to the `<footer>` element at the bottom of the page.

# --hints--

There should be only one anchor tag on your page.

```js
assert.lengthOf(document.querySelectorAll('a'), 1);
```

There should be only one `footer` tag on your page.

```js
assert.lengthOf(document.querySelectorAll('footer'),1);
```

The `a` tag should have an `href` attribute set to "#footer".

```js
assert.strictEqual(document.querySelector('a').getAttribute('href'), '#footer');
```

The `a` tag should not have a `target` attribute.

```js
assert.notExists(document.querySelector('a').getAttribute('target'));
```

The `a` text should be "Jump to Bottom".

```js
assert.match(document.querySelector('a').textContent,/Jump to Bottom/gi);
```

The `footer` tag should have an `id` attribute set to "footer".

```js
assert.strictEqual(document.querySelector('footer').getAttribute('id'),'footer');
```
