# --description--

Sometimes you want to add `a` elements to your website before you know where they will link.

This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using `JavaScript`, which we'll learn about later.

# --instructions--

The current value of the `href` attribute is a link that points to "`https://www.freecatphotoapp.com`". Replace the `href` attribute value with a `#`, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.

For example: `href="#"`

# --hints--

Your `a` element should be a dead link with the value of the `href` attribute set to "#".

```js
assert.strictEqual(document.querySelector('a').getAttribute('href'),'#');
```
