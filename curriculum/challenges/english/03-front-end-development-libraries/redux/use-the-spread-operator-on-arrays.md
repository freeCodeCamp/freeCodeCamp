# --description--

One solution from ES6 to help enforce state immutability in Redux is the spread operator: `...`. The spread operator has a variety of applications, one of which is well-suited to the previous challenge of producing a new array from an existing array. This is relatively new, but commonly used syntax. For example, if you have an array `myArray` and write:

```js
let newArray = [...myArray];
```

`newArray` is now a clone of `myArray`. Both arrays still exist separately in memory. If you perform a mutation like `newArray.push(5)`, `myArray` doesn't change. The `...` effectively *spreads* out the values in `myArray` into a new array. To clone an array but add additional values in the new array, you could write `[...myArray, 'new value']`. This would return a new array composed of the values in `myArray` and the string `new value` as the last value. The spread syntax can be used multiple times in array composition like this, but it's important to note that it only makes a shallow copy of the array. That is to say, it only provides immutable array operations for one-dimensional arrays.

# --instructions--

Use the spread operator to return a new copy of state when a to-do is added.

# --hints--

The Redux store should exist and initialize with a state equal to `["Do not mutate state!"]`.

```js
assert(
  (function () {
    const initialState = store.getState();
    return (
      Array.isArray(initialState) === true &&
      initialState[0] === 'Do not mutate state!'
    );
  })()
);
```

`addToDo` and `immutableReducer` both should be functions.

```js
assert(typeof addToDo === 'function' && typeof immutableReducer === 'function');
```

Dispatching an action of type `ADD_TO_DO` on the Redux store should add a `todo` item and should NOT mutate state.

```js
const initialState = store.getState();
const isFrozen = !!DeepFreeze(initialState);
store.dispatch(addToDo('__TEST__TO__DO__'));
const finalState = store.getState();
const expectedState = ['Do not mutate state!', '__TEST__TO__DO__'];
assert(isFrozen)
assert.deepEqual(finalState, expectedState);
```

The spread operator should be used to return new state.

```js
assert(code.includes('...state'));
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const immutableReducer = (state = ['Do not mutate state!'], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TO_DO':
      // Don't mutate state here or the tests will fail
      return
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addToDo = (todo) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TO_DO',
    todo
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```

# --solutions--

```js
const immutableReducer = (state = ['Do not mutate state!'], action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TO_DO':
      return [
        ...state,
        action.todo
      ];
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const addToDo = (todo) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TO_DO',
    todo
  }
}

const store = Redux.createStore(immutableReducer);
```
