# --description--

Similar to how the tilde we learned about in the last challenge allows npm to install the latest PATCH for a dependency, the caret (`^`) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.

Your current version of `@freecodecamp/example` should be `~1.2.13` which allows npm to install to the latest `1.2.x` version. If you were to use the caret (^) as a version prefix instead, npm would be allowed to update to any `1.x.x` version.

```json
"package": "^1.3.8"
```

This would allow updates to any `1.x.x` version of the package.

# --instructions--

Use the caret (`^`) to prefix the version of `@freecodecamp/example` in your dependencies and allow npm to update it to any new MINOR release.

**Note:** The version numbers themselves should not be changed.

# --hints--

`"dependencies"` should include `"@freecodecamp/example"`.

```js
  $.get(code + '/_api/package.json').then(
    (data) => {
      var packJson = JSON.parse(data);
      assert.property(
        packJson.dependencies,
        '@freecodecamp/example',
        '"dependencies" does not include "@freecodecamp/example"'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

`"@freecodecamp/example"` version should match `"^1.x.x"`.

```js
  $.get(code + '/_api/package.json').then(
    (data) => {
      var packJson = JSON.parse(data);
      assert.match(
        packJson.dependencies["@freecodecamp/example"],
        /^\^1\./,
        'Wrong version of "@freecodecamp/example". It should be ^1.2.13'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
