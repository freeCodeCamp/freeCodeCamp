# --description--

`Model.remove()` is useful to delete all the documents matching given criteria.

# --instructions--

Modify the `removeManyPeople` function to delete all the people whose name is within the variable `nameToRemove`, using `Model.remove()`. Pass it to a query document with the `name` field set, and a callback.

**Note:** The `Model.remove()` doesn’t return the deleted document, but a JSON object containing the outcome of the operation, and the number of items affected. Don’t forget to pass it to the `done()` callback, since we use it in tests.

# --hints--

Deleting many items at once should succeed

```js
  $.ajax({
    url: code + '/_api/remove-many-people',
    type: 'POST',
    contentType: 'application/json',
    data: JSON.stringify([
      { name: 'Mary', age: 16, favoriteFoods: ['lollipop'] },
      { name: 'Mary', age: 21, favoriteFoods: ['steak'] }
    ])
  }).then(
    (data) => {
      assert.isTrue(!!data.ok, 'The mongo stats are not what expected');
      assert.equal(
        data.n,
        2,
        'The number of items affected is not what expected'
      );
      assert.equal(data.count, 0, 'the db items count is not what expected');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
