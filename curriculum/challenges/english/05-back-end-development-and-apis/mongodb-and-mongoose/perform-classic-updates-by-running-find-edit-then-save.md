# --description--

In the good old days, this was what you needed to do if you wanted to edit a document, and be able to use it somehow (e.g. sending it back in a server response). Mongoose has a dedicated updating method: `Model.update()`. It is bound to the low-level mongo driver. It can bulk-edit many documents matching certain criteria, but it doesnâ€™t send back the updated document, only a 'status' message. Furthermore, it makes model validations difficult, because it just directly calls the mongo driver.

# --instructions--

Modify the `findEditThenSave` function to find a person by `_id` (use any of the above methods) with the parameter `personId` as search key. Add `"hamburger"` to the list of the person's `favoriteFoods` (you can use `Array.push()`). Then - inside the find callback - `save()` the updated `Person`.

**Note:** This may be tricky, if in your Schema, you declared `favoriteFoods` as an Array, without specifying the type (i.e. `[String]`). In that case, `favoriteFoods` defaults to Mixed type, and you have to manually mark it as edited using `document.markModified('edited-field')`. See our <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/introduction-to-mongoose-for-mongodb-d2a7aa593c57/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Mongoose article</a>.

# --hints--

Find-edit-update an item should succeed

```js
  $.post(code + '/_api/find-edit-save', {
    name: 'Poldo',
    age: 40,
    favoriteFoods: ['spaghetti']
  }).then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(data.name, 'Poldo', 'item.name is not what is expected');
      assert.equal(data.age, 40, 'item.age is not what expected');
      assert.deepEqual(
        data.favoriteFoods,
        ['spaghetti', 'hamburger'],
        'item.favoriteFoods is not what expected'
      );
      assert.equal(data.__v, 1, 'The item should be previously edited');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
