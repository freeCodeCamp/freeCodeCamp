# --description--

Mount a POST handler at the path `/name`. Itâ€™s the same path as before. We have prepared a form in the html frontpage. It will submit the same data of exercise 10 (Query string). If the body-parser is configured correctly, you should find the parameters in the object `req.body`. Have a look at the usual library example:

<blockquote>route: POST '/library'<br>urlencoded_body: userId=546&#x26;bookId=6754 <br>req.body: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</blockquote>

Respond with the same JSON object as before: `{name: 'firstname lastname'}`. Test if your endpoint works using the html form we provided in the app frontpage.

Tip: There are several other http methods other than GET and POST. And by convention there is a correspondence between the http verb, and the operation you are going to execute on the server. The conventional mapping is:

POST (sometimes PUT) - Create a new resource using the information sent with the request,

GET - Read an existing resource without modifying it,

PUT or PATCH (sometimes POST) - Update a resource using the data sent,

DELETE - Delete a resource.

There are also a couple of other methods which are used to negotiate a connection with the server. Except for GET, all the other methods listed above can have a payload (i.e. the data into the request body). The body-parser middleware works with these methods as well.

# --hints--

Test 1 : Your API endpoint should respond with the correct name

```js
  $.post(code + '/name', { first: 'Mick', last: 'Jagger' }).then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(
        data.name,
        'Mick Jagger',
        'Test 1: "POST /name" route does not behave as expected'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

Test 2 : Your API endpoint should respond with the correct name

```js
  $.post(code + '/name', {
    first: 'Keith',
    last: 'Richards'
  }).then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(
        data.name,
        'Keith Richards',
        'Test 2: "POST /name" route does not behave as expected'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
