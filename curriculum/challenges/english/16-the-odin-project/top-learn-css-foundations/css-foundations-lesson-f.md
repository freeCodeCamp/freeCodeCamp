Okay, you went over quite a bit so far. The only thing left for now is to go over how to add all this CSS to your HTML. There are three methods to do so.

External CSS is the most common method you will come across, and it involves creating a separate file for the CSS and linking it inside of an HTML’s opening and closing `<head>` tags with a self-closing `<link>` element:

First, you add a self-closing `<link>` element inside of the opening and closing `<head>` tags of the HTML file. The `href` attribute is the location of the CSS file, either an absolute URL or, what you’ll be utilizing, a URL relative to the location of the HTML file. In the example above, you are assuming both files are located in the same directory. The `rel` attribute is required, and it specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked file.

Then inside of the newly created `styles.css` file, you have the selector (the `div` and `p`), followed by a pair of opening and closing curly braces, which create a “declaration block”. Finally, you place any declarations inside of the declaration block. `color: white; ` is one declaration, with `color` being the property and `white` being the value, and `background-color: black;` is another declaration.

A note on file names: `styles.css` is just what you went with as the file name here. You can name the file whatever you want as long as the file type is `.css`, though “style” or “styles” is most commonly used.

A couple of the pros to this method are:

1. It keeps your HTML and CSS separated, which results in the HTML file being smaller and making things look cleaner.
2. You only need to edit the CSS in one place, which is especially handy for websites with many pages that all share similar styles.
