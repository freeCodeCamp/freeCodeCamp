# --description--

Numbers are the building blocks of programming logic! In fact, it’s hard to think of any useful programming task that doesn’t involve at least a little basic math… so knowing how numbers work is obviously quite important. Luckily, it’s also fairly straightforward.

| Operator | Description                  | Example            |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------------|
| +        | Addition                     | 5 + 3 = 8          |
| -        | Subtraction                  | 5 - 3 = 2          |
| *        | Multiplication               | 5 * 3 = 15         |
| **       | Exponentiation               | 5 ** 3 = 125       |
| /        | Division                     | 6 / 3 = 2          |
| %        | Modulus                      | 5 % 3 = 2          |


# --assignment--

Given the table of operators above, write a simple program snippet that demonstrates the use of each operator with the variable `x` initialized to `10`.

# --question--

## --text--

What is the result of applying the modulus operator to `x` where `x = 10`?

## --answers--

`x % 3` results in `1`

---

`x % 3` results in `3`

---

`x % 3` results in `0`

---

`x % 3` results in `2`
