# --description--

Because the box model concept is so incredibly fundamental, letâ€™s dig a bit deeper with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#what_is_the_css_box_model" target="_blank">this lesson from MDN</a>.

Pay close attention to the examples and take the time to experiment with their in-browser editor!
