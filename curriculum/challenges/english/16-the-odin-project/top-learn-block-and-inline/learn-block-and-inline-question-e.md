# --description--

Inline-block elements behave like inline elements, but with block-style padding and margin. `display: inline-block` is a useful tool to know about, but in practice, you'll probably end up reaching for flexbox more often if you're trying to line up a bunch of boxes. Flexbox will be covered in-depth in the next lesson.
