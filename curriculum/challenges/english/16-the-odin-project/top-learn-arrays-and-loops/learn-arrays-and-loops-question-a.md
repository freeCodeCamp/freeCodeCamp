# --description--

Strings and numbers may be our building blocks, but as your scripts get more complex, you're going to need a way to deal with large quantities of them. Luckily, JavaScript has a couple of data types that are used for just that. An Array is an ordered collection of items (Strings, numbers, or other things).

Arrays are a way to store multiple values in a single variable. They are a special type of object that has a length property and a series of numbered properties. Each numbered property is called an element, and each element can store a value of any type.

An Example of an array is:

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
```
