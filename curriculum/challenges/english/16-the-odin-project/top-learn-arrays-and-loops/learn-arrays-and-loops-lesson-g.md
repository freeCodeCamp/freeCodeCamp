# --description--

Now that you know about the most common ways to iterate over values and arrays, there are a few more ways to iterate over arrays. Arrays have a built-in method called `map()`, which is used to create a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array. The `map()` method does not change the original array. The syntax of the `map()` method is as follows:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const newArray = array.map((arrayValue) => {
  return arrayValue * 2;
});

console.log(newArray); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

The `map()` method creates a new array by applying the function `(arrayValue) => { return arrayValue * 2; }` to each element of the original array. This is particularly useful when you want to transform the elements of an array without changing the original array.
