# --description--

Strings defined using backticks are called template literals. They are a new way to define strings in JavaScript. They allow you to embed expressions within the string. This is done by wrapping the expression in `${}`.

For example, the following code:

```javascript
let name = "John";
let age = 25;
let greeting = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
```

will result in the `greeting` variable containing the string "Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old."
