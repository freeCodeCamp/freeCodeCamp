# --description--

Another way to compare conditional statements would be the ternary operator. The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement. It is used to evaluate a condition and return a value based on the result of the condition. The syntax of the ternary operator is as follows:

```javascript
let result = condition ? value1 : value2;
```

In the above example, if the condition is true, the value of `result` will be `value1`. Otherwise, the value of `result` will be `value2`.

Ternary operators are often used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. They are also used to return a value based on a condition.
