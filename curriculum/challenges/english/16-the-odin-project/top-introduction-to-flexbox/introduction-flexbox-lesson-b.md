# --description--

As you’ve seen, flexbox is not just a single CSS property but a whole toolbox of properties that you can use to put things where you need them. Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This is a simple yet important concept.

A flex container is any element that has `display: flex` on it. A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.
