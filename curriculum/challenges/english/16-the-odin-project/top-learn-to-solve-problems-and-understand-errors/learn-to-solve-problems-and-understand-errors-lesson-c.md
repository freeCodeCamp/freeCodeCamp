## Psuedocode

Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code. It helps you slow down and think through the steps your program will have to go through to solve the problem.

Hereâ€™s an example of what the pseudocode for a program that prints all numbers up to an inputted number might look like:

```bash
When the user inputs a number
Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
Print the value of the counter variable
```

This is a basic program to demonstrate how pseudocode looks. There will be more examples of pseudocode included in the assignments.
