# --questions--

## --text--

What's the best answer to Sophie's question?

## --answers--

`Probably because it's important for the project.`

### --feedback--

This does not answer `how long`, as it provides a reason instead of a time frame.

---

`Probably for another two weeks.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Sophies uses `how long` to ask for an estimated duration or time frame. An appropriate response would include a specific amount of time, such as `a few days`, `two weeks`, or `until the end of the month`.
