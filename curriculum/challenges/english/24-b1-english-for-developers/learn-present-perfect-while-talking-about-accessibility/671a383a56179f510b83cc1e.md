2

# --explanation--

Tom's response, `We haven't been receiving as many negative comments`, uses the `Present Perfect Continuous` in the negative form. This tense is formed by `haven't/hasn't + been + verb(-ing)` and is used to describe actions that have not been happening over a period of time. In this case, it shows that fewer negative comments have been received over time, indicating a possible improvement.
