`Tom and Sophie are working to make their app easier to use for people who have visual impairments. They have made adjustments to help screen readers, which are tools that read the screen aloud.`

`Recently, they added special labels to buttons, menus, and forms, so screen readers can understand these parts better. They also improved the way headings, lists, and tables are organized, making the layouts easier for users to move through the app.`

`Tom has been testing these improvements using popular screen readers, while Sophie has been focusing on tweaking the app's text-to-speech function. They also increased the contrast, which helps users see different sections more clearly.`
