Imagine you are working with a teammate on a software update. Your teammate says:

- `I have tested the login feature.`

- `I have been testing the login feature.`

What is the difference in meaning between these two sentences?

The first sentence uses `Present Perfect Simple` tense, meaning the testing is complete, while the second sentence uses `Present Perfect Continuous` tense, meaning the testing started earlier and is still happening.

---

The first sentence means the teammate will start testing soon, while the second sentence means they will keep testing in the future.

# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect Simple` tense (`I have tested the login feature`) suggests that the testing is complete and the result is important. The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense (`I have been testing the login feature`) indicates that the testing has been ongoing and may still be in progress, emphasizing the duration of the action.
