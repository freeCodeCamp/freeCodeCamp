## --text--

`Linda and her team are working on a new voice command system for smart homes. The goal is to make it easier for everyone, including people with disabilities, to control devices like lights and doors using their voice.`

`One challenge is making sure the system understands different accents. The team has been testing the system with users from different regions, but there are still some problems with background noise.`

`For example, the system sometimes has trouble understanding voices in noisy rooms, like kitchens or living rooms with TVs or radios on. To fix this, they are improving the system's ability to filter out noise and better recognize commands.`

`Before launching the system, the team plans to gather real-world feedback from users to see how well it works in different home settings. This feedback will help them make the system more accurate and ready for everyone to use.`

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, pay attention to the section about why the team wants to gather real-world feedback.

The paragraph states that real-world feedback will help the team understand how well the system works `in different home settings`, which is crucial for identifying issues that may not show up in controlled testing environments.

Look for an option that focuses on how the team plans to use feedback from actual users to improve the system.
