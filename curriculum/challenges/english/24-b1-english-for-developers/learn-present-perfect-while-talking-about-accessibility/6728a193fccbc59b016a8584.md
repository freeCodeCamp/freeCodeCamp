<!-- (audio) Bob: How long have you been focusing on this evaluation? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How can you respond to Bob's question using the word `since`?

## --answers--

`I have been focusing on this evaluation since last week.`

---

`I will focus on this evaluation since tomorrow.`

### --feedback--

The use of `since` here is not appropriate because it refers to a future action rather than something that has already started.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

In the `Present Perfect Continuous` tense, `since` is used to indicate the starting point of an action that began in the past and continues into the present, making it clear that Bob is still engaged with the evaluation process.
