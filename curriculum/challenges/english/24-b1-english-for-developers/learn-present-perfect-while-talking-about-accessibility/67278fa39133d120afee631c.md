# --questions--

## --text--

What does Bob want to know from Linda?

## --answers--

If Linda has been engaged in developing the new voice command features.

---

If Linda is planning to work on the new features.

### --feedback--

Bob is asking if Linda has already been working, not about future plans.

---

What the new voice command features are.

### --feedback--

Bob is inquiring about Linda's work on them, not their definition.

---

When Linda started working on the new features.

### --feedback--

Bob's question focuses on whether she has been working, not when she started.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense (`have been working`) indicates an action that started in the past and is still ongoing or has relevance to the present. Bob's question suggests he is interested in Linda's current progress on the project.
