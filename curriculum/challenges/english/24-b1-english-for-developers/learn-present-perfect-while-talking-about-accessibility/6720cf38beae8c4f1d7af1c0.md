## --sentence--

`Alice: James, have you heard about the BLANK on our video platform?`

`James: Yes. For some reason, It hasn't been BLANK for some users. The captions are misaligned and BLANK, which isn't good for accessibility.`

`Alice: Exactly. Do you know if it's been affecting all the videos or just a few?`

`James: It seems to be affecting several videos. Our quality assurance team has been testing the platform, and noticed that the captions aren't syncing properly.`

`Alice: BLANK. Have they found out why it's happening?`

`James: Not yet. The synchronization code hasn't been updated in a while, which might be part of the problem. Also, the captions haven't been BLANK across different devices.`

`Alice: Is there a plan to fix it?`

`James: We're working on it. The development team hasn't found a BLANK yet, but they're narrowing down the possibilities.`
