After their conversation, James wrote an email to Alice to update her about what the development team is doing to fix the issues.

`Hi Alice,`

`I wanted to give you an update about our work on the closed captioning problem we talked about.`

`The development team has been working hard to find the cause of the issues. We think some of the problems, like captions being misaligned or out of sync, are because the synchronization code is old. We are now updating the code and testing it on different devices to make sure the captions work better everywhere.`

`We haven't found a final solution yet, but we are seeing some improvements. The captions are showing up better on most devices, but we still need to do more testing to make sure it works well on all of them. We also plan to add a system that will catch any new errors quickly.`

`I'll keep you updated as we make more progress. If you have any questions or ideas, please let me know.`

`Best,`

`James`
