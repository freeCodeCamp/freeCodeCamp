# --explanation--

The interrogative form of the `Present Perfect Continuous` is created by using `Have/Has + subject + been + verb(-ing)`. It is used to ask about actions that started in the past and are still happening. For example:

`Have they been testing the new software features?` - Someone checks if the testing has been ongoing.
