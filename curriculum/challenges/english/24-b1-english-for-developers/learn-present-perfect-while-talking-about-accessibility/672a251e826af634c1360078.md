`Integration` is the process of linking different systems or components. For example: 

`The integration of our new software with the old system was quick and efficient.` - This means that the two systems were successfully combined to work together.

`Seamless` refers to something being smooth, continuous, and without problems or interruptions. For example: 

`The integration of the new software was seamless, with no disruptions to the workflow.` - This means that the software `integration` happened smoothly, without any problems or delays, making the transition easy and efficient.
