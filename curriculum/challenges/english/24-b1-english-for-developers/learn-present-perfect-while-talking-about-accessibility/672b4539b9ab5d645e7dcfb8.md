`Linda and her team are working on a new voice command system for smart homes. The goal is to make it easier for everyone, including people with disabilities, to control devices like lights and doors using their voice.`

`One challenge is making sure the system understands different accents. The team has been testing the system with users from different regions, but there are still some problems with background noise.`

`For example, the system sometimes has trouble understanding voices in noisy rooms, like kitchens or living rooms with TVs or radios on. To fix this, they are improving the system's ability to filter out noise and better recognize commands.`
