`Anna: Hi James, have you been reviewing the BLANK for our accessibility program?`

`James: Yes, I've been working on it since the last training session. We've received a lot of positive comments, but there are some areas we still need to improve.`

`Anna: That's great to hear. How long have we been running these sessions?`

`James: We've been conducting them for about six months now. It's been a BLANK, but we've seen steady progress in our teams' understanding of accessibility.`

`Anna: Are there any specific areas where people haven't been BLANK?`

`James: We're working on it. The instructional design team has been brainstorming ideas to make the sessions more interactive. We're also considering incorporating more BLANK.`
