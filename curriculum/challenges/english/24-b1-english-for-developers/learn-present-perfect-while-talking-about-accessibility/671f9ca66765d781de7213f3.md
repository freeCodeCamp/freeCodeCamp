# --explanation--

`Development team` refers to the group of people working on building or improving a product.

`Solution` means an answer or method that resolves a problem. For example:

`We found a solution to the server issue.` - It indicates that the server problem could be addressed and resolved.

`Narrow down` means to reduce the number of options to focus on the most likely ones. For example:

`We need to narrow down our choices to the top three candidates.` - It means you need to limit the list of candidates to a smaller, more manageable number.
