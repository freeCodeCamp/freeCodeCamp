# --explanation--

A `firewall` is a security system that protects a network by controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules. 

`Settings` refer to configurations or adjustments that determine how something functions. 

`Firewall settings` are the specific rules or configurations used to manage network security. For example:

- `We updated the firewall settings to block unauthorized access.` - This means adjustments were made to prevent access by unauthorized users.

- `Enhancing firewall settings can help prevent cyber attacks.` - This means improving the configurations to increase security against online threats.
