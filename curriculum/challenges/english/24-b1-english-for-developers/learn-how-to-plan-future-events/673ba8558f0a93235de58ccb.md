# --explanation--

The pronoun `its` is a possessive pronoun that indicates something belongs to or is associated with a subject. For example:

`The system operates best when its temperature is regulated.` - This means the system works well when the temperature belonging to it is controlled.

The word `lowest` is the superlative form of `low`, meaning the least amount or the smallest degree. For example:

`The lowest temperature recorded was in the early morning.` - This means the smallest temperature measured occurred in the morning.

In Maria's sentence, `at its lowest` refers to the lowest level of user traffic for the server.
