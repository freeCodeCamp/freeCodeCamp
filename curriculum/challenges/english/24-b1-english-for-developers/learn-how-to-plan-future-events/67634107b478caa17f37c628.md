# --explanation--

The purpose of the training is to improve the team's skills and reduce security risks. Let's break it down:  

The text begins with, `To protect our databases from threats like SQL injection attacks`. The preposition `to` introduces the purpose of the entire training. It shows that the main goal is to protect the database from threats.  

The next part, `we are going to focus on improving the team's skills`, explains how this purpose will be achieved. By improving their skills, the team will learn methods to address these threats effectively.  

The training is described as teaching developers `how to use parameterized queries and follow best practices`. These specific actions connect directly to reducing security risks, which ties back to the purpose stated at the beginning.  

By following this structure, you can conclude that the training is focused on improving skills to protect the database, making this the primary purpose of the session.
