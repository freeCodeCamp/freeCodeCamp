# --explanation--

`Database` refers to a system where data is stored and organized.

`Activity` refers to the actions or processes happening in the database.

- `The database contains customer information and order details.` - This means the database stores important business data.  

- `There was unusual activity in the database last night.` - This means something unexpected happened in the database.

Together, `database activity` means all the actions, changes, or processes happening within the database system.
