`Reassure` means to provide confidence or reduce someone's anxiety about a situation.

`We are taking` combines the verb `to be` with a verb ending in `-ing`. This is often used to talk about future actions already planned or happening soon. For example:

- `I'll reassure the team that we are reviewing the report.` - This means you will comfort the team by telling them the review is happening soon.  

- `She is meeting the client tomorrow to reassure them about the changes.` - This shows the `to be` + a verb ending in `-ing` structure for a planned event.
