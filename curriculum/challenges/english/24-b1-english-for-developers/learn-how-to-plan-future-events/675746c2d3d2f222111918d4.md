# --explanation--

Jake uses `might` to show uncertainty about the deadlines being affected. He also says, `I hope it won't`, which expresses hope that the deadlines remain unaffected. For example:

- `The software update might cause some delays.` - This means it is possible, but not certain, that delays will happen.

- `I hope the server won't go down during the deployment.` - This expresses a desire for the server to remain operational.
