This is a message Jake sent to his team:

`Hi Team,`

`Here is the checklist for the upcoming system update. All tasks must be completed on time:`  

`- Thursday afternoon: The training session for the new security protocols is planned.`  
`- Friday afternoon: All security patches are ready to be deployed.`  
`- Friday evening: The final system checks are set.`  
`- Saturday at 2 AM: The system update is scheduled to start, with server downtime lasting two hours.`  
`- During the update: The support team is on call to manage any immediate issues.`  

`Firewall settings are enhanced by Friday to prevent potential DoS attacks. Let me know if there are any questions!`

To find out when the final system checks take place, focus on the part of the message that lists the schedule. 

Look for the phrase `The final system checks are...` to find the correct time.
