# --explanation--

`Database security` refers to protecting databases from unauthorized access or attacks. For example:

`The team is improving database security to prevent hackers from accessing confidential data.` - This means they are making the database safer to stop any illegal access. 

Jake says he is `looking into` their `database security`, which means he is investigating or checking its safety.
