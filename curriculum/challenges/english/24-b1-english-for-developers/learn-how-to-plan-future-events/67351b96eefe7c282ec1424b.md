# --explanation--

`To be scheduled` means to set a specific date and time for something to happen. In this case, the system update is planned for a specific day and hour. For example: 

- `The meeting is scheduled for Monday at 10 AM.` - This means the meeting will happen on Monday at 10 AM. 

- `The release is scheduled for next month.` - This means the release will take place sometime in the upcoming month.
