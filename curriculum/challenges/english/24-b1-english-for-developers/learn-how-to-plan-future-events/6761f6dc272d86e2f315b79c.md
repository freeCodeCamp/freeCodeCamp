Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What's Jake's plan?

## --answers--

To improve the database's performance with faster queries.

### --feedback--

Jake's plan focuses on minimizing risk, not improving the database speed.

---

To implement parameterized queries to minimize the risk.

---

To add more servers to handle heavy traffic.

### --feedback--

Jake doesn't mention servers or traffic. He talks about securing the database.

---

To fix the errors caused by broken queries.

### --feedback--

Jake is not fixing broken queries. He's focused on reducing risks by implementing a specific security method.

# --explanation--

`Implement` means to put an idea or solution into action.  

`Parameterized queries` are a method used in databases to reduce security risks, like SQL injection. This works by using placeholders for data instead of inserting user input directly into the query.  

In this sentence, Jake's plan is to take action to improve security and prevent risks.
