# --explanation--

Maria asks, `when is that planned?` The verb `is` in the `Present Simple` shows she believes the training session is already scheduled. The `Present Simple` is often used for fixed future plans, like schedules or timetables. For example:

- `The train departs at 6 PM.` - This shows a planned future event using the `Present Simple`.

- `What time does the concert start?` - This assumes the concert has a fixed start time.
