# --explanation--

Maria's statement, `Yes, Jake, I've reviewed the timetable`, shows she has already checked or looked over the schedule for the system update. `To review` something means to examine or go over it carefully. For example:

- `I reviewed the project proposal before the meeting.` - This means you checked the proposal to understand it.

- `She reviewed the instructions before starting the task.` - This means she examined the instructions to ensure she knew what to do.
