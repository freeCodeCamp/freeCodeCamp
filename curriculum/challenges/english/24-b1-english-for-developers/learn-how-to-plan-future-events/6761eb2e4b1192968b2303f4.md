<!-- (audio) Jake: I've been looking into our database security, and I think we're going to need some additional measures to prevent SQL injection attacks. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does Jake describe their current database security?

## --answers--

They are not prepared at all and need to start from scratch.

### --feedback--

Jake doesn't say they have no security at all. Listen again to his comment about needing additional measures.

---

They have some security, but they need more measures to improve it.

---

They have already taken additional measures and are now fully protected.

### --feedback--

Jake mentions `additional measures`, which means they haven't done it yet.

---

Their security is perfect, and no further actions are required.

### --feedback--

Jake clearly says they need to add more measures, so their security is not perfect yet.

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

Jake says he has been `looking into` their database security, which means he is investigating its current state. He concludes that they `need additional measures`, meaning some security exists, but it's not enough. For example:  
 
`The team needed additional measures to ensure their security was strong.` - This means the team added extra steps to improve something that already existed. 

Jake's statement shows their database security is in place but requires more work to prevent `SQL injection attacks`.
