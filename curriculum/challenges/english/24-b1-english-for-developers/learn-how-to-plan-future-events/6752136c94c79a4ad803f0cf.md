This is a message Jake sent to his team:

`Hi Team,`

`Here is the checklist for the upcoming system update. All tasks must be completed on time:`  

`- Thursday afternoon: The training session for the new security protocols is planned.`  
`- Friday afternoon: All security patches are ready to be deployed.`  
`- Friday evening: The final system checks are set.`  
`- Saturday at 2 AM: The system update is scheduled to start, with server downtime lasting two hours.`  
`- During the update: The support team is on call to manage any immediate issues.`  

`Firewall settings are enhanced by Friday to prevent potential DoS attacks. Let me know if there are any questions!`

Why are the firewall settings enhanced by Friday?

## --answers--

To prevent potential DoS attacks.

---

To minimize disruption during the downtime.

### --feedback--

While minimizing disruption is mentioned elsewhere, it is not the reason given for enhancing firewall settings.

---

To ensure the system update happens on time.

### --feedback--

The system update happens on Saturday, but this task is unrelated to the timing of the update.

---

To manage immediate issues during the update.

### --feedback--

Managing immediate issues is the responsibility of the support team, not the firewall settings.

# --explanation--

To find out why the firewall settings are enhanced, focus on the sentence `Firewall settings are enhanced by Friday to prevent potential DoS attacks.` 

The text explicitly states this purpose, emphasizing the importance of preparing for potential cyber threats.
