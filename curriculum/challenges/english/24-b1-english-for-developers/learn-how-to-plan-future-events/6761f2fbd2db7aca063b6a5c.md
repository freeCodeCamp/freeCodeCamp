# --explanation--

`Recommend` means to suggest or advise something as a good idea or solution. Maria uses `going to` in her question to ask about **future actions** or plans. For example:  

`What are you going to recommend for the project?` - This asks what someone will suggest as a solution or improvement.  

In this sentence, Maria wants to know what Jake will suggest to improve security in the future. She is not asking about past actions or problems, but about ideas to move forward.
