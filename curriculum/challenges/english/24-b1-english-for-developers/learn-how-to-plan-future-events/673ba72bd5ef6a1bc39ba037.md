`downtime`

This word refers to a period when a system or service is not available or operational.

# --explanation--

`Downtime` is a period when a system or service is unavailable or not operational. It is often scheduled to perform maintenance, updates, or repairs. 

`Server downtime` specifically refers to the time when a server — a computer system that provides data, services, or resources to other devices — is temporarily unavailable. For example:

- `The server downtime was scheduled at midnight to minimize the impact on users.` - This means the server was made unavailable at midnight to reduce inconvenience to users.

- `Unexpected downtime occurred due to a power failure.` - This means the system became unavailable without prior planning because of a power outage.
