A `Denial of Service (DoS)` attack is a cyber-attack intended to make a network or service unavailable to its intended users, usually by overwhelming it with traffic. This type of attack disrupts normal service, causing slowdowns or complete outages. For example:

- `The system went down due to a denial of service attack.` - This means the system became unavailable because it was overwhelmed by malicious traffic.
  
- `Enhanced firewall settings can help prevent DoS attacks.` - This means improved firewall configurations can reduce the risk of such attacks by blocking unwanted traffic.
