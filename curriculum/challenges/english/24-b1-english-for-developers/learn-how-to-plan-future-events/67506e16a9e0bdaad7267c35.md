## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

`And when does the team perform the final checks?`, uses the `Present Simple` tense (`does perform`) to ask about a scheduled future event. 

The correct answer, `The final system checks are set for Friday night`, also uses the `Present Simple` to describe a fixed plan. 

`Present Simple` is often used for future events that are part of a schedule or timetable. For example:

- `The train departs at 8 PM tonight.` - This indicates a scheduled departure.

- `Our meeting starts tomorrow morning.` - This shows a planned time for a future event.

In this context, the `Present Simple` makes the answer concise and appropriate for discussing a fixed event.
