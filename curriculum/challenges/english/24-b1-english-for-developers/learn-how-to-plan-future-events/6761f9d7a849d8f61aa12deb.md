# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, listen for the words:  

`Should reduce` shows Jake's intention to make something smaller or less likely.    

`Unauthorized access` refers to someone without permission trying to view or use data.  

Jake says `this should reduce the chances of unauthorized access to our data`. 

This shows his plan is to minimize a security risk, not to fix backups, errors, or improve database performance.
