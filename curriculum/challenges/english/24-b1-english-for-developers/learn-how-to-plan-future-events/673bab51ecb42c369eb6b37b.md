# --explanation--

Maria's question uses the `Present Simple` tense, `The server downtime starts...`, to talk about a planned event. 

This is common when discussing schedules or timetables, as the `Present Simple` indicates something fixed or organized in the future. Her intention is to confirm the timing of the downtime as planned.

The answer, `That's right. The update should last about two hours`, confirms her statement and provides additional detail about the expected duration of the update.
