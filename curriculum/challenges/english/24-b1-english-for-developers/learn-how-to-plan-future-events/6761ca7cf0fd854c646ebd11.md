# --explanation--

The clients say, `We're very concerned about the security of our data.` 

This clearly shows their main concern is the **safety of their data**. 

They ask, `Can you confirm when this issue will be fully resolved?` which suggests they are looking for reassurance that their data is secure and the problem will soon be fixed. For example:  

- `We're worried about losing sensitive information.` - This shows concern for data safety.  

- `Is the system safe now?` - This reflects a need for confirmation about the resolution.
