<!-- (Audio) Alice: That makes sense. Do we have any plans for how often we'll check their progress? -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`That makes sense. Do we have BLANK plans for how often we'll check BLANK progress?`

## --blanks--

`any`

### --feedback--

This determiner is used when asking about the existence of plans, often in questions or negatives.

---

`their`

### --feedback--

This possessive determiner shows that the progress belongs to the new developers.

# --explanation--

`Any plans` uses `any` because Alice is asking if plans exist - `any amount`, not specific plans.

`Their progress` uses `their` to show ownership - the progress belongs to the new developers they are discussing.
