`no extra developers`

### --feedback--

These three words show a total lack of available people.

# --explanation--

`Your point` uses `your` to show ownership - it's the point Maria made.

`No extra developers` uses `no` to express a complete lack of available people for the task. Another example:

`No extra designers are available this week.` - No other designers can help right now.
