# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`What about BLANK new developers we started onboarding BLANK weeks ago?`

## --blanks--

`those`

### --feedback--

This demonstrative determiner points to specific developers known to both the speaker and listener.

---

`a few`

### --feedback--

It's a quantifier used to talk about a small number of things (more than one, but not many). Use two words.

# --explanation--

`Those new developers` uses `those` because Alice is talking about specific developers they already know and have discussed.

`A few weeks` uses `a few` to describe a small number of weeks - typically 2-4 weeks.
