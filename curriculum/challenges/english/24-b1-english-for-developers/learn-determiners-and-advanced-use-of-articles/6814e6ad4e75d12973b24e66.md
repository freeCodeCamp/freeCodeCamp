# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I'll make a plan for BLANK and share it with you tomorrow.`

## --blanks--

`resource allocation`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means how something is shared or assigned.

# --explanation--

`Resource allocation` means deciding how to divide and assign resources (like time, people, or tools) to different tasks or projects. For example:

- `Good resource allocation helps the team work faster.` - If you share resources well, the team finishes tasks more quickly.

- `Poor resource allocation caused delays in the project.` - The resources weren't shared properly, so the project was late.

You don't use an article before it because `allocation` is uncountable in this context and is part of a general concept.
