After meeting with Maria, Jake prepared the report she asked for:

`Cloud Storage Comparison Report`

`Prepared by Jake`

`As we expand globally, we need a cloud storage provider that supports our capacity and security needs. I've compared two main options: one based in the U.S. and the other in Europe.`

`The U.S. provider offers strong security features at a lower cost, but may fall short on data privacy, especially under strict European regulations. The Europe-based provider ensures better compliance with laws but comes at a higher price.`

`In terms of performance, our developers have reported slowdowns with the current provider, particularly in Europe. The European option could improve speed for users in that region.`

`For scalability, both options support growth, but we'll run a test project next month with the European provider to check real-time performance, support quality, and how well it can scale with us.`

`Choosing the right provider means balancing cost, security, performance, and compliance. I'll keep you updated as we gather more insights from the test.`
