# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Perhaps we could slightly extend BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`the current team's hours`

### --feedback--

These four words refer to the working time of a specific group. Use the definite article, an adjective for time, and a possessive form before a plural noun.

# --explanation--

`The current team's hours` uses `the` because it refers to a specific group (the current team) and their existing working schedule. More examples:

- `The current team's hours are already maxed out.` - The team is already working as much as they can.

- `Can we adjust the current team's hours to cover the evening shift?` - Someone is asking if the team's schedule can be changed to include later work.
