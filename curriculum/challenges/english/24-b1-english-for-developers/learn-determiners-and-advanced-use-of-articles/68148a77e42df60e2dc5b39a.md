# --explanation--

`That sounds reasonable` shows that you agree politely and think the plan makes sense. `Reasonable` means something is fair, logical, and possible to do. For example:

- Person 1: `We can test the new feature on Friday and release it next week.`

- Person 2: `That sounds reasonable. Let's go with that plan.` - This person agrees and thinks the idea is fair or makes sense.
