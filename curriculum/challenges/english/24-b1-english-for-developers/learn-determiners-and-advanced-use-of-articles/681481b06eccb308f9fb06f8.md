# --explanation--

`Allocate` means to divide and assign resources, such as time, money, or technology, for a specific task or project. For example:

`The manager will allocate resources based on project priority.` - The manager will decide where the resources should go depending on which project is most important.

`Server capacity` means the available computing resources - storage, power, or space - that a server can provide. For example:

`The server capacity wasn't enough during the sale event.` - Too many people visited at once, and the server couldn't keep up.
