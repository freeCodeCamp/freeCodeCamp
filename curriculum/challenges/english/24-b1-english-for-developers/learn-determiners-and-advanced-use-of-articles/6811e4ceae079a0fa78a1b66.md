## --sentence--

`Jake: Maria, as we expand globally, we need to ensure our BLANK meets our capacity and security needs. I've checked out a few options, focusing on data centers in Europe and North America.`

`Maria: That's great, Jake. Since our data is sensitive, choosing the right location is crucial, especially with the BLANK in Europe. What options are we considering?`

`Jake: I've narrowed it down to two main providers. One has data centers mostly in the U.S., offering strong security features at a lower cost. The other provider has data centers in Europe, giving better data privacy but at a higher price.`

`Maria: Security and cost are important, but we also need to think about speed and growth. Our developers have said there are BLANK with our current provider, especially during busy times.`

`Jake: That's a good point. The European option might reduce slowdowns for our European customers and improve performance. But, we need to balance that with higher costs.`

`Maria: Can we try out the European BLANK? Testing it in real situations could give us better insights into its performance.`

`Jake: That's a practical idea. I'll arrange for a test project with them next month. We'll track key performance details and get feedback from the team.`

`Maria: Great, Jake. Let's also ensure that the provider we choose can grow with us without needing BLANK.`

`Jake: Agreed. I'll include growth plans in our tests and review the support services to see how helpful they are with tech issues.`

`Maria: Thanks, Jake. Keep me updated on the test's progress and prepare a detailed BLANK. We should go over it together to make a final choice.`

`Jake: Will do, Maria. I'll make sure everything is carefully tested so we can choose a solution that balances performance, cost, security, and BLANK.`
