<!-- (audio) Jake: I've checked out a few options, focusing on data centers in Europe and North America. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Is Jake correct to leave out an article before `Europe and North America`?

## --answers--

No, he should say `the Europe and the North America`.

### --feedback--

This is incorrect - continent names don't take `the`.

---

Yes, because names of continents don't need articles.

---

No, he should say `some Europe and some North America`.

### --feedback--

This is not natural English for continents or regions.

---

Yes, but only because they are both in the same sentence.

### --feedback--

The sentence structure doesn't affect the article use. It's about the type of noun.

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

Zero article is used with most continent and country names: `Europe`, `Asia`, `North America`, `Germany`, etc.

`The` is used with groups or plural names, like: `the Netherlands`, `the United States`, or `the Philippines`.
