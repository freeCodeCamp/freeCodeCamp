## --sentence--

`We'll meet again BLANK to finish everything.`

## --blanks--

`this Friday`

### --feedback--

These two words refer to a specific day this week.

# --explanation--

`This Friday` means the Friday in the current week - not next week or in general.

You use `this` as a demonstrative determiner to show something is near in time or already expected. For example:

- `I have a lot of deadlines this month.` - Many tasks must be finished before the month ends.

- `The meeting is scheduled for this Thursday.` - The meeting will happen on the upcoming Thursday.
