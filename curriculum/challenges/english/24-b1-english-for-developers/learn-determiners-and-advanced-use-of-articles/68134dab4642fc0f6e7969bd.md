## --blanks--

`their`

### --feedback--

This possessive determiner shows that the responsibilities belong to each team member.

---

`the`

### --feedback--

This article is used because `end` is specific - it's a known point in time.

---

`this`

### --feedback--

This demonstrative determiner refers to the current week.

# --explanation--

`Their responsibilities` uses `their` to show that the responsibilities belong to each person individually.

`The end` uses `the` because it refers to a specific moment (the end of the week).

`This week` uses `this` to refer to the current week they are in right now.
