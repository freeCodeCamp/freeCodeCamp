### --feedback--

This two-word phrase refers to a document that shows differences and similarities between two or more things.

# --explanation--

`Test's progress` refers to the ongoing development or advancement of a test. Here, it uses `the` because it refers to a specific, known test (the one they are planning). Another example:

`I'll update you on the test's progress after reviewing the latest results.` - You'll tell somene how the test is doing, whether it's going well or needs some adjustments.

A `comparison report` is a document that shows the differences and advantages between different options, helping people make a decision. Here, it uses `a` because it's the first mention of this specific report. Another example:

`I need to finish the comparison report by tomorrow.` - You have to complete the document that compares different options by tomorrow.
