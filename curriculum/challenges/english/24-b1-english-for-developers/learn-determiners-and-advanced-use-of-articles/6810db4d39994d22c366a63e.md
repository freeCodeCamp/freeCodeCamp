# --explanation--

The article `a` is used before singular countable nouns when you talk about something in a general or non-specific way.

In the sentence `That's a good point`, the word `point` is a singular countable noun. Since it's not a specific point Jake has talked about before, he uses the article `a` to introduce it. This rule also applies to similar phrases like:

- `That's a good idea.`

- `That's a nice thing to say.`

In each case, you are mentioning one general example of an idea, thing, or point - not a specific one, so you use `a` instead of `the`.
