<!-- (Audio) Jake: That's a good point. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`That's BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`a good point`

### --feedback--

These three words mean a valid idea or opinion.

# --explanation--

The article `a` is used before singular countable nouns when you talk about something in a general or non-specific way.

In `That's a good point`, `point` is a singular countable noun. Since it's not a specific point Jake has talked about before, he uses the article `a` to introduce it. 

This rule also applies to similar phrases like:

- `That's a good idea.`

- `That's a nice thing to say.`

In each case, you are mentioning one general example of an idea, thing, or point - not a specific one, so you use `a` instead of `the`.
