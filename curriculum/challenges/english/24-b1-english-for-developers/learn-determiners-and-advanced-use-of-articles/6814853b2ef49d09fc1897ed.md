`our yearly goals`

### --feedback--

These three words describe shared targets for a team or group. Use a possessive adjective followed by a plural noun and a time-related adjective.

# --explanation--

`Half of` means 50% of something - part of a whole. For example:

- `Half of the users reported a bug.` - 50% of the users said there was a problem.

- `Only half of the team could join the meeting.` - Just 50% of the team was present.

`The main project` uses `the` because they are referring to one specific, most important project.

`Our yearly goals` uses `our` to show ownership as these goals belong to their company or team.
