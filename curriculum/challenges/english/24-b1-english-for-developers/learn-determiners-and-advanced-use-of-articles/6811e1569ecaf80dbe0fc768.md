# --explanation--

`A solution` is an answer to a problem or challenge. Here, it uses `a` because it introduces a new, singular option - one solution among many. Another example:

`She found a solution that works for both teams.` - She found something that makes everyone happy.

`Compliance` is an uncountable noun meaning following rules and legal requirements. No article is used when speaking about it generally. For example:

`Compliance is important when dealing with sensitive information.` - It's important to follow the rules when working with private data.
