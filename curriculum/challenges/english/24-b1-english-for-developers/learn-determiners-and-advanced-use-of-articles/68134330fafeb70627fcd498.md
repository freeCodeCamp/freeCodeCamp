`a little short on`

### --feedback--

This four-word phrase means not having enough of something but not by a large amount.

# --explanation--

`A little short on` is an informal phrase that means not having quite enough of something. It suggests a small lack, not a major shortage. For example:

- `We're a little short on time, so let's keep the meeting brief.` - The team doesn't have much time available.

- `The project is a little short on resources to finish by Friday.` - It doesn't have enough tools, money, or people to be completed on time.

It's softer and less serious than saying `we don't have enough`.
