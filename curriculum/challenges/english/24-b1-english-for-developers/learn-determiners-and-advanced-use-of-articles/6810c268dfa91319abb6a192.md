# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`One has data centers mostly in BLANK U.S., offering strong security features at BLANK lower cost.`

## --blanks--

`the`

### --feedback--

This article is used before country names that include words like `States`, `Kingdom`, or `Republic`.

---

`a`

### --feedback--

This is the correct article to introduce a general singular noun that is not specific.

# --explanation--

`The U.S.` is an example of a country name that takes the definite article because it's short for `the United States of America` - a collection of states. You can also use `the` with `the Netherlands`, `the United Kingdom`, etc.

`A lower cost` uses the indefinite article `a` because it refers to one unspecified example among many possible levels of cost.
