# --explanation--

`Make changes` is a common phrase that means to edit, adjust, or update something. For example:

- `We need to make changes to the design.` - The current design isn't working, so they should update it.

- `They made changes after testing the app.` - The team updated the app based on what they learned from testing.

`The whole team` uses `the` because Maria is talking about a specific, known team - the one working on the current project.
