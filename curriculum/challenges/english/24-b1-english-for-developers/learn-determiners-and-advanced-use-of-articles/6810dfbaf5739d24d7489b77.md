# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`But we need to balance that with BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`higher costs`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase describes the type of price.

# --explanation--

In `higher costs`, no article is needed because `costs` is a plural countable noun used in a general sense.

Earlier, Jake mentioned `a lower cost` and `a higher price` - these were singular, specific amounts, so an article (`a`) was needed. Take a look:

- `We must prepare for higher costs.` - Here, `costs` is plural and used in a general sense.

- `They offered a lower cost.` - Here, `cost` is singular and one `cost` being talked about.
