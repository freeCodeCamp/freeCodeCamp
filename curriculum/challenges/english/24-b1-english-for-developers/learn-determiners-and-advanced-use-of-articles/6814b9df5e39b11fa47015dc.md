# --explanation--

`Either` is used to introduce a choice between two options. In this case, using contractors or spreading the work.

`Contractors` are temporary or freelance workers, often hired for a specific job. For example:

`We hired contractors to help with the new app design.` - External workers are helping with designing the app.

In this dialogue, you don't use an article before `part-time contractors` because it's a general category, not a specific group.
