# --explanation--

`Growth plans` refer to strategies for business expansion or development. Since it's plural and mentioned in a general way, no article is needed. Another example:

`The team discussed their growth plans for the next year.` - They talked about how they want to grow or improve.

`The support services` refer to the help provided by a company, usually for technical or customer issues. You use `the` because Jake is talking about specific services from the provider being tested. Another example:

`The support services are available 24/7.` - You can get help any time of the day.

`Tech issues` is short for `technology issues`, which refers to general technical problems. It is plural and used without an article when talking generally. For example:

`We had some tech issues during the video call.` - There were problems with the technology while the team was on the call.
