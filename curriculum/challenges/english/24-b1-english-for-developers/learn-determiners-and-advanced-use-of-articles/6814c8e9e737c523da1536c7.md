## --sentence--

`Let's also ensure that any changes in BLANK are communicated clearly.`

## --blanks--

`task distribution`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means how something is shared or spread across different people or areas.

# --explanation--

`Task distribution` means how tasks are shared or assigned among team members. For example:

- `Task distribution was not fair during the last project.` - Some team members had too much work, others had too little.

- `Good task distribution helps everyone work faster.` - When tasks are shared well, the team can be more productive.

In this dialogue, `task distribution` is abstract - you don't use an article before it when referring to it in general.
