# --explanation--

A `slowdown` is when something becomes slower. For example:

`There was a slowdown in the website after the update.` - The website started working more slowly than before.

`Busy times` refer to general peak periods (like mornings or holidays) when systems often experience heavy use. For example:

`During busy times, our servers need to handle more traffic.` - When many people use the system at once, it has to work harder.

You don't need an article here because it's a general description of when performance drops.
