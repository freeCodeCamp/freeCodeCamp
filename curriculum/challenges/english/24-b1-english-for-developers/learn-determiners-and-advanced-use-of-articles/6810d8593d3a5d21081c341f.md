# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Our developers have said there are BLANK with our current provider, especially during BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`slowdowns`

### --feedback--

This noun means things are moving more slowly than usual.

---

`busy times`

### --feedback--

These two words mean periods when many people use the service.

# --explanation--

A `slowdown` is when something becomes slower. For example:

`There was a slowdown in the website after the update.` - The website started working more slowly than before.

`Busy times` refer to general peak periods (like mornings or holidays) when systems often experience heavy use. For example:

`During busy times, our servers need to handle more traffic.` - When many people use the system at once, it has to work harder.

You don't need an article here because it's a general description of when performance drops.
