`I'm considering bringing in BLANK people for BLANK project.`

## --blanks--

`a couple more`

### --feedback--

---

`this`

### --feedback--

This demonstrative determiner refers to the specific project they are already working on.

# --explanation--

`A couple more` means two or three additional people - it's an informal way to talk about a small increase. For example:

`I downloaded a couple more plugins for the website.` - You added two or a few additional tools to improve the website.

`This project` uses `this` because Bob is referring to the current, specific project they are already discussing.
