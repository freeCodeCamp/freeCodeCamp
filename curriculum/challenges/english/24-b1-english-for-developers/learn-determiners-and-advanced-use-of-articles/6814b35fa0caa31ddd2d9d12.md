<!-- (Audio) Maria: Neither the developers nor the project managers want longer hours. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK the developers BLANK the project managers want longer hours.`

## --blanks--

`Neither`

### --feedback--

This word is used to show that not one or the other wants something. The first letter is capitalized.

---

`nor`

### --feedback--

This word is used together with `neither` to join two negative options.

# --explanation--

`Neither ... nor` is a paired conjunction structure used to show that two things are both not true. For example:

- `Neither the app nor the website is working right now.` - Both the app and the website are not working.

- `He has neither the experience nor the skills for this task.` - He doesn't have experience or skills.

You use `the` before both `developers` and `project managers` because they refer to specific roles within the team.
