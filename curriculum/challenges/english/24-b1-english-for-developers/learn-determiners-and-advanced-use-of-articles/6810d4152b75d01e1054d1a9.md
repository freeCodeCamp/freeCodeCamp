`growth`

### --feedback--

This word refers to progress or expansion, and it is used as an uncountable noun when talking generally.

# --explanation--

In this sentence, the nouns `security`, `cost`, `speed`, and `growth` are used in a general, abstract way.

You don't use articles like `the` or `a` with uncountable or abstract nouns when you talk about them in general terms. For example:

- `Security is a big concern.` - Here, you talk in general.

- `The security of this building is very strict.` - It's a specific case, so `the` is used.
