What does Maria suggest they do before sharing the plan?

## --answers--

Give the plan directly to the team without reviewing it.

### --feedback--

Maria says they should review and adjust it before showing the team.

---

Review it and make changes together first.

---

Send it to only the managers.

### --feedback--

She wants to share it with the whole team, not just managers.

---

Make changes after the team gives feedback.

### --feedback--

She suggests making changes before sharing the plan, not after.

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Maria wants to `review it together and make changes` first, so the version they show to `the whole team` is clear and complete. She's suggesting team collaboration before a full release.
