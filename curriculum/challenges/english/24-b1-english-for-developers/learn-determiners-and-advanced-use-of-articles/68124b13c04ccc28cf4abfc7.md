<!-- (Audio) Bob: This way, every new person gets help and no one feels too stressed. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK way, BLANK new person gets help and BLANK one feels too stressed.`

## --blanks--

`This`

### --feedback--

It's a demonstrative determiner pointing to the method Bob just explained.

---

`every`

### --feedback--

It means all members of a group individually, seen as a whole group.

---

`no`

### --feedback--

It means not a single person.

# --explanation--

`This way` uses `this` to refer to the method Bob just described.

`Every new person` uses `every` when talking about all individuals together (like a whole group).

`No one` means zero people - not a single person.

Both `each` and `every` describe all people, but the feeling is slightly different:

- `Each` focuses on individuals separately: `Each developer has a mentor.`

- `Every` focuses on the group as a whole: `Every developer gets support.`
