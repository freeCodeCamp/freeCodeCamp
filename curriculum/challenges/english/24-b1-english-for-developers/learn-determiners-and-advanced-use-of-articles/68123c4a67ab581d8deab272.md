`tasks`

### --feedback--

This word means pieces of work that need to be completed. Use the plural form.

# --explanation--

`Each` is used to talk about every single member of a group separately. For example:

`Each team member has a different role.` - Every person in the team does something different.

`Their` is a possessive determiner that matches plural meaning without showing gender (his/her). For example:

`They updated their software yesterday.` - The software that belongs to them was updated.

`Tasks` are specific jobs or pieces of work assigned to someone. For example:

`I finished my daily tasks before lunch.` - You completed the things you needed to do today before lunchtime.
