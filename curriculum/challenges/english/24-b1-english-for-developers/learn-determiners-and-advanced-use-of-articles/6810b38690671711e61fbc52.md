## --sentence--

`I've checked out a few options focusing on BLANK in Europe and North America.`

## --blanks--

`data centers`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase refers to large facilities that store digital information. Use the plural form.

# --explanation--

`Data centers` are buildings or systems used to store and manage large amounts of data. For example:

`Our files are stored in secure data centers.` - The company keeps digital information safe in special buildings.

Because it is a plural noun used generally, there is no `the` or `some` in this case.
