# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Yes. We'll meet BLANK two weeks to talk about how everyone is doing and to solve BLANK problems.`

## --blanks--

`every`

### --feedback--

This determiner means happening regularly for each period (here, every two weeks).

---

`any`

### --feedback--

This determiner is used for non-specific problems - not known yet.

# --explanation--

`Every two weeks` means something happens once in each two-week period - this is often called `bi-weekly`.

`Any problems` uses `any` to refer to any issues that might happen, even if we don't know what they are yet.

**Note:** `Bi-weekly` can sometimes mean "twice a week" or "every two weeks", but here it means "every two weeks" based on the context.
