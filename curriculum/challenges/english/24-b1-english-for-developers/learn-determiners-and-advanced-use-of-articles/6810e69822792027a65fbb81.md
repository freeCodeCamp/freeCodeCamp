`Its` is a possessive determiner used to show that something belongs to a thing (not a person). Notice there's no apostrophe. Here, `its performance` means the performance of the European provider.

No article is used before `real situations` or `better insights` because they are plural, general ideas.

You normally do not use articles when talking about general, plural nouns.
