# --explanation--

Jake is talking about getting the company's digital tools ready to support international growth.

He mentions `cloud storage` (where data is saved online) and `capacity and security needs` (what is required for the system to handle more users safely). This means they want to make sure their systems are strong enough as the company expands.
