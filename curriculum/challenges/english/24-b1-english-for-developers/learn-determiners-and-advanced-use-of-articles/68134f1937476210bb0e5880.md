`technical requirements`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase refers to specific needs a project must meet.

# --explanation--

`A list` uses `a` because it introduces something new - one list, mentioned for the first time.

`Technical requirements` are specific needs a system or project must meet (like software functions, speed, storage, etc.). They describe what the technology must be able to do. For example:

- `The software didn't meet the technical requirements.` - The program didn't follow the needed technical standards.

- `Can you list all the technical requirements for the new app?` - Someone is asking to name all the tech needs the app must follow.
