`Pushback` refers to opposition or disagreement with a plan or suggestion. For example:

- `We got some pushback from the client about the new design.` - The client didn't fully agree or had objections to the design.

- `Expect pushback if we change the deadline again.` - People may resist or complain if the date changes.
