`Testers` are people who check products (like apps or websites) to find problems or bugs before the final version is released. For example:

- `The testers found several bugs during the first round.` - People who tested the product discovered some issues.

- `Our testers are focusing on user experience this week.` - The team of testers is currently checking how easy and smooth the app is to use.

`QA testers` (Quality Assurance testers) are very important for ensuring the product works correctly.
