# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Great, Jake. Let's also ensure that BLANK we choose can grow with us without needing BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`the provider`

### --feedback--

This refers to a specific company or service. Don't forget to use an article if necessary.

---

`big changes`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means major adjustments.

# --explanation--

`The provider` uses the definite article `the` because it refers to the specific provider they are planning to choose.

`Big changes` are major updates or adjustments that affect a system, team, or plan. For example:

`The company made big changes to the website design.` - The website looks very different now.

`Big changes` does not use an article because `changes` is a plural countable noun used in a general way (not specific).
