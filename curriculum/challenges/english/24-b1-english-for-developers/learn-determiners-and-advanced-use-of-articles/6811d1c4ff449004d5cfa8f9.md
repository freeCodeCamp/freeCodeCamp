`big changes`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means major adjustments.

# --explanation--

`The provider` uses the definite article `the` because it refers to the specific provider they are planning to choose.

`Big changes` are major updates or adjustments that affect a system, team, or plan. For example:

`The company made big changes to the website design.` - The website looks very different now.

`Big changes` does not use an article because `changes` is a plural countable noun used in a general way (not specific).
