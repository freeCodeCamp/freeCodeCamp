# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`We need to make sure BLANK is missed.`

## --blanks--

`no critical task`

### --feedback--

This phrase means not a single task should be forgotten. Use a negative determiner followed by an adjective and a singular countable noun.

# --explanation--

`No critical task` means not a single important task should be forgotten or left out.

`No` is a strong determiner used to say none of something exists or should happen. For example:

`The project failed because there was no proper task distribution.` - The tasks weren't given out in a good way, and the project didn't work.
