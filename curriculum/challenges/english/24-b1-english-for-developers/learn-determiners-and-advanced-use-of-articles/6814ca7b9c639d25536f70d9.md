### --feedback--

# --explanation--

`No critical task` means not a single important task should be forgotten or left out.

`No` is a strong determiner used to say none of something exists or should happen. For example:

`The project failed because there was no proper task distribution.` - The tasks weren't given out in a good way, and the project didn't work.
