`our smaller initiatives`

### --feedback--

This refers to the smaller projects. Don't forget to use a possessive determiner showing it belongs to the team.

# --explanation--

`The other half` uses `the` because it refers to the second part of something already discussed - the server capacity.

`Initiative` refers to a new plan or action designed to solve a problem or improve a situation. It often means a project, program, or effort started by a person or team to reach a specific goal. For example:

`The company launched a new sustainability initiative.` - They started a new plan focused on environmental goals.

In this dialogue, `our smaller initiatives` uses `our` because the smaller projects belong to James' team.
