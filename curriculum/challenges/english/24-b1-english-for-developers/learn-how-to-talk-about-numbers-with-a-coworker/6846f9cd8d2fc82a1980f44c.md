## --blanks--

`tenth task`

### --feedback--

These two words show the position of a task in a sequence.

# --explanation--

Remember, an **ordinal number** shows order or position in a list: `first`, `second`, `third` ... `tenth`.

Here, `tenth task` means it's the final step in the plan. Another example:

`The tenth task on the agenda was project review.` - It came last in a list of ten items.
