<!-- (audio) Tom: Most of them, around thirty, are allocated to the design team. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK of them, BLANK thirty, are allocated to the design team.`

## --blanks--

`Most`

### --feedback--

This word means "more than half", or "the majority". The first letter is capitalized.

---

`around`

### --feedback--

This word means "approximately" - not the exact number, but close.

# --explanation--

`Most` means the majority, or more than 50% of something. For example:

`Most developers use version control tools.` - The majority of developers work with version control.

`Around` means about or approximately. It is used when the number is not exact. For example:

`Around 20 people joined the training session.` - About 20 people attended the training.

So Tom is saying that a large part of the licenses - about 30 - are used by the design team.
