What does Sophie mean when she says they need to `go through the inventory`?

## --answers--

They should throw out all their old software.

### --feedback--

She says `go through`, not `throw out` or `remove`.

---

They need to review or check each item on the list.

---

They should install new software tools.

### --feedback--

There's no mention of installing new tools.

---

They are going to test all the tools today.

### --feedback--

Testing may be part of it, but `go through` means checking the full list first.

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

`Go through` means to review something step by step. For example:

`She will go through the design with the client tomorrow.` â€” She will review and discuss the design with the client.

Sophie means they should review the inventory of software tools and likely check what's still in use or needs updating.
