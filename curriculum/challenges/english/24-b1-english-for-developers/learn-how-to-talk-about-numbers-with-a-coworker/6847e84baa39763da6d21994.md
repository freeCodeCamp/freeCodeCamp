`Start with` means to begin by focusing on one part before the rest. For example:

`Start with what you know.` - Begin by using the information or skills you already have.

`Allocated across` means that resources (like money) are divided and assigned to different parts of a project. For example:

`Resources are allocated across multiple projects.` - Tools, time, and people are shared between different projects.

David is asking Alice to begin by explaining how the money is divided among the project phases.
