<!-- (audio) Alice: Up to this point, we've used about 40% of the total budget. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How much of the total budget has been used so far?

## --answers--

More than 80%

### --feedback--

That would be near completion. Alice says only 40% has been used so far.

---

Only 4%

### --feedback--

That's too low. She mentions 40%, which is a large part of the budget.

---

About 40%

---

The entire budget has already been spent.

### --feedback--

She clearly says `about 40%`, so some funds are still available.

## --video-solution--

3

# --explanation--

Alice says, `Up to this point, we've used about 40% of the total budget`.
