# --explanation--

To `redefine` means to change the way you see or do something - usually to make it clearer or better. For example:

`The company redefined its goals after customer feedback.` - The team changed their goals to improve them.

A `milestone` is an important point in a project - like a big goal or checkpoint. For example:

`Finishing the first version of the app is a major milestone.` - It's a key step in the process that shows progress.

Jessica wants to `redefine the milestones`, which means to change the goals or checkpoints of the project.
