# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Hi, Jessica. We have BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`four major phases`

### --feedback--

The first word is a cardinal number, and the following two-word phrase refers to the important steps in a process.

# --explanation--

A **cardinal number** tells you "how many" of something there are. Words like `one`, `two`, `three`, `four` are all cardinal numbers. For example:

`We completed two phases of the project.` - `Two` tells you the number of phases.

`Major phases` means the important stages or main parts of a project. So, `four major phases` means there are four big or important steps in their project plan.
