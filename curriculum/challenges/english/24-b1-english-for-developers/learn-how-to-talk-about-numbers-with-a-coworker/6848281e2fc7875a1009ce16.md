This refers to a backup plan or budget reserved for possible unexpected problems. Don't forget to use an article if necessary.

# --explanation--

To `set aside` means to reserve or save something, especially money or time, for a specific future purpose. For example:

`It's smart to set aside money for unforeseen expenses.` - It's good to keep some extra money for surprises.

A `contingency` is a backup or emergency plan, especially for situations that might not happen but could. For example:

`It's important to have contingency measures during testing.` - You need extra steps or plans in case things don't go as expected during testing.

Alice is saying they reserved 15% of the budget in case of unplanned situations.
