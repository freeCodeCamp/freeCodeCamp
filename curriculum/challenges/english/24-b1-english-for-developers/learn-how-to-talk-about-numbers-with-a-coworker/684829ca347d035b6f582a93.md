# --explanation--

`Unexpected costs` are surprise expenses - things you didn't plan for in the original budget. For example:

`The project was delayed due to unexpected costs.` - The team had to stop or slow down the work because they had to pay for things they didn't plan for.

`The later stages` are the final parts of a project. For example:

`Design changes are easier to make before the later stages.` - It's easier to change the design early in the project, not near the end.

Alice is saying the reserved funds will be used if problems happen near the end of the project.
