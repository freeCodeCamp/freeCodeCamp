After talking with James, Jessica updated the project timeline with a clear timeline and shared it with the team:

`Updated Project Timeline`

`Hi team,`

`We've updated our project timeline after reviewing the schedule.`

`The first phase is finalizing the software requirements, which should be done by Friday, March 7, 2025. In the second phase, we have ten development tasks. One important task is setting up the core database, as many other parts depend on it. This development phase will run from March 10 to April 4, 2025. The third phase is all about initial testing, and we aim to finish it by April 30, 2025. Finally, in the last phase, we'll spend two weeks on beta testing and fixing any critical issues. The final task in this phase is preparing the deployment documentation, which should be ready by May 16, 2025.`

`Let me know if you have any questions or need help with your part of the plan.`

`Best,`

`Jessica`
