# --explanation--

`User experience` (or `UX`) is about how a user feels when using a product — whether it's easy, enjoyable, and smooth. For example:

`Improving page load time boosts user experience.` — Making pages load faster helps users enjoy the app more.

`Enhancements` are changes made to improve a product or process. For example:

`The latest update includes performance enhancements.` — The new version makes the app work better and faster.

In Alice's sentence, half of the design budget is spent on making the product easier and better to use.
