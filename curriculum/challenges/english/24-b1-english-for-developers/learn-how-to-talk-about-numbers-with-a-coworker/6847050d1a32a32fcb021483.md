# --explanation--

A `breakdown` means a clear and simple explanation, often step-by-step. For example:

`The breakdown of the schedule helps us plan better.` - Splitting the schedule into steps makes it easier to understand.

Just to clarify - Jessica is not talking about a `mental breakdown`. That would mean being overwhelmed or stressed out. In this dialogue, it's a positive thing - she's thanking James for explaining the plan clearly.
