## --sentence--

`We should have that ready near BLANK the project.`

## --blanks--

`the last week of`

### --feedback--

These four words refer to the final seven days before something (like a deadline or event) ends.

# --explanation--

`The last week of` means the final seven days in a time period. It's often used in planning and scheduling. For example:

`We'll do final checks in the last week of April.` â€” That means during the final seven days before April ends.

James says they want the task finished around the final days of the project.
