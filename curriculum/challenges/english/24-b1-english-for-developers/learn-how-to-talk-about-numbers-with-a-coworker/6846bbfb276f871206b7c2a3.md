# --explanation--

`Initial phase` means the beginning stage of something. For example:
 
`During the initial phase of testing, we found several bugs.` - This means bugs were found at the start of testing.

To `finalize` means to complete or finish something officially. For example:

`We need to finalize the design before the meeting.` - They need to complete the design.

So, James is saying: In the first stage, the most important job is to complete the software requirements.
