# --explanation--

`Installed` means software is set up and applied on a device so it works properly. For example:

`The installed program is working fine.` - The program that was set up is working well.

`By next day`, `by next week`, `by next month` mean no later than the end of next day/week/month. For example:

- `The update should be ready by next day.` - The update will be finished the following day.

- `We plan to finish testing by next month.` - Testing should be done before the next month starts.

Tom is saying these software updates are urgent and must be completed within a specific time frame.
