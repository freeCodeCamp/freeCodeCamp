`fifty licenses`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase uses a cardinal number to state the legal permissions granted to use, own, or perform something. The second word is in the plural form.

# --explanation--

Remember, **cardinal numbers** are used to show how many of something there are. For example, `one license`, `ten computers`, `fifty users`.

In the dialogue, `fifty licenses` means the team currently has 50 permissions to use various software tools.
