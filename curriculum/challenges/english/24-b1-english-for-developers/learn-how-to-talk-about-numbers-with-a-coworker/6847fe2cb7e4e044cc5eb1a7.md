# --questions--

## --text--

What is the correct way to spell out ⅗?

## --answers--

`Three-fifths`

---

`Three-fifth`

### --feedback--

This is missing the plural form `-s` for `fifths`. Use plural when the numerator is more than one.

---

`Third-fifths`

### --feedback--

This mixes up ordinal and fractional terms. `Third` is not used here.

---

`Five-thirds`

### --feedback--

This reverses the numbers. ⅗ means three parts out of five - not five parts out of three.

# --explanation--

The correct way to write ⅗ in words is `three-fifths`. Use this format:

Numerator (in cardinal form) + denominator (in plural if numerator > 1). For example:

- ⅖ = `two-fifths`

- ⅘ = `four-fifths`

This is helpful when explaining data or sharing financial details in spoken presentations.
