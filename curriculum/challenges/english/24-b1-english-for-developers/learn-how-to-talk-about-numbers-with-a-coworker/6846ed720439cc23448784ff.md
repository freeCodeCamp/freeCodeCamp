`If all goes well` means that things happen smoothly and as planned, without delays or problems. For example:

`We can launch the new app next week if all goes well.` — If everything works out, the app will be ready next week.

`Third` is an ordinal number showing the position in a sequence.

`Initial testing` is the first stage of testing, usually focused on checking the basic features and spotting major bugs early. For example:

`The app passed initial testing on Android.` — The app worked well in the first test on Android phones.
