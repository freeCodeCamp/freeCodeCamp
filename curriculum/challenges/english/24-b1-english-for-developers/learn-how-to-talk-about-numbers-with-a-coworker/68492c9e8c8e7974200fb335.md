# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Let's start with BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`the licenses`

### --feedback--

These are legal permissions that allow you to use software. Don't forget to use an article if necessary.

# --explanation--

A `license` is a legal agreement that allows you to use software or a digital product. Companies often buy licenses for tools like Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Cloud, or development platforms. For example:
 
`We have five licenses for our design software.` - This means five people can legally use that software.

In Sophie's sentence, she wants to begin by checking how many software licenses the team has.
