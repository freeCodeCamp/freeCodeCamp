# --explanation--

`Make sure to` is used to express responsibility or promise which means the speaker will definitely do something. For example:

`Make sure to save your work before closing.` - Don't forget to save before you shut the program.

`As needed` means doing something only when it becomes necessary. For example:

`We can add more team members as needed.` - They'll add people only if it becomes necessary.

In Alice's sentence, she's saying she'll regularly inform David and change the budget plan if the project's progress requires it.
