This two-word phrase refers to a detailed explanation of how money is planned and divided in a project.

# --explanation--

A `budget` is a plan for how money will be spent during a project or time period. For example:

`We went over budget last month.` - They spent more money than they planned.

A `breakdown` is a detailed explanation or division of something. For example:

`The breakdown of expenses shows where the money was spent.` - Here, `breakdown` means a detailed list that explains costs.

So, a `budget breakdown` shows how the total project budget is divided into smaller parts, such as salaries, tools, or services.
