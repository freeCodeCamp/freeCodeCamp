## --blanks--

`a stable release`

This two-word phrase means launching a version of the product that is reliable, tested, and free from serious bugs. Don't forget to use an article if necessary.

# --explanation--

A `stable release` refers to a final version of a product that has been fully tested and is safe for real users. It should work correctly, with minimal bugs or errors. For example:

`A stable release means the software is reliable and safe to use.` - This version of the software doesn't crash or have serious errors, so users can trust it.

In Alice's sentence, she's saying it's important to invest in testing and quality to make sure the software is reliable when it's launched.
