<!-- (audio) Sophie: I saw some in the storage room. How many are there? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Sophie is asking for a number. Which answer is correct?

## --answers--

`There are ten tablets in the storage room.`

---

`Ten tablets is in the storage room.`

### --feedback--

This is incorrect grammar as the subject and verb don't match.

---

`It's ten tablets there.`

### --feedback--

This sentence is unclear and informal. It doesn't follow proper sentence structure.

---

`Are ten tablets in the storage.`

### --feedback--

This is phrased like a question and `storage` is missing the word `room`.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

The correct structure to give a count is:

`There are` + cardinal number + item in the plural form + `in` + place. â€” `There are ten tablets in the storage room.`

This is grammatically correct and clearly answers the question.
