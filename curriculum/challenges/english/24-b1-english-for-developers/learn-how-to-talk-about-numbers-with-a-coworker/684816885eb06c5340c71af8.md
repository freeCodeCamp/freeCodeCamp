<!-- (audio) Alice: This covers everything from initial unit tests to final quality assurance checks before launch. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`This covers everything from BLANK to final BLANK before launch.`

## --blanks--

`initial unit tests`

### --feedback--

These three words refer to the first tests developers run on individual pieces of code.

---

`quality assurance checks`

### --feedback--

These three words refer to detailed tests done at the end of development.

# --explanation--

`Initial unit tests` are the first step in testing. Developers check small parts of the code (`units`) to make sure they do what they're supposed to. For example:

`We wrote initial unit tests to check the main functions.` - The team created early tests to make sure the most important parts of the code worked correctly.

`Quality assurance (QA) checks` are final tests done by QA teams to make sure the software is reliable, user-friendly, and ready for launch. For example:

`Regular QA checks help prevent bugs from reaching users.` - Frequent testing by QA helps catch errors early, so users don't face problems.

Alice is describing how the testing budget covers all steps, from early coding checks to final testing before launch.
