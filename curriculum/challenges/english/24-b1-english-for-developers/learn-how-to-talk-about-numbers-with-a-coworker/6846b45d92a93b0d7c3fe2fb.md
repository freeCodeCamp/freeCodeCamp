# --explanation--

A `phase` is one part of a larger process. Projects are often divided into `phases` to help manage tasks and time. For example:

`We are in the testing phase of the project.` - The project is in the part where they test what they've built.

Jessica is asking how many different steps or `phases` are already planned in the project.
