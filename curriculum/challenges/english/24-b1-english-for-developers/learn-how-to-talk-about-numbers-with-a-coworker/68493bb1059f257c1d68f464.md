`cloud storage`

These two words refer to online space where files are saved and accessed through the internet.

# --explanation--

`Cloud storage` is a way to save files online so that they can be accessed from anywhere with internet. For example:

Tom says some of the licenses are stored online, in case they're needed outside the main office system.
