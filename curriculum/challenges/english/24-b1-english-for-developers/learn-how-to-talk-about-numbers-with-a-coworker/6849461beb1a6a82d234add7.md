<!-- (audio) Tom: There are ten tablets in the storage room, right between the spare monitors and the old project files. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`There are ten tablets in the storage room, right between BLANK and the BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`the spare monitors`

### --feedback--

These are extra screens not currently in use but kept in case they're needed. Use two words and an article if necessary.

---

`old project files`

### --feedback--

These are saved documents from past work that are no longer active. Use three words.

# --explanation--

`Spare monitors` are extra computer screens kept as backups or for future use. For example:

`We have three spare monitors in case one breaks.` — There are 3 extra monitors ready to use if needed.

`Old project files` refer to documents or data from completed projects. For example:

`He found some old project files on the server.` — He found files from past projects saved on the server.

Tom is explaining exactly where the tablets are placed in the storage room — between these two items.
