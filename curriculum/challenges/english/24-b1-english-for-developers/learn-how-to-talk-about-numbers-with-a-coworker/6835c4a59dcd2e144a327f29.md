`Jessica: Hey James, I've been reviewing our project schedule, and I think we need to redefine our milestones. How many phases do we currently have planned?`  
`James: Hi Jessica, we have four major phases. For the BLANK, the first task is to finalize the software requirements by next Friday.`  
`Jessica: Okay, that’s good. For the BLANK, how many development tasks are we looking at?`  
`James: We’ve outlined ten tasks for development. The BLANK involves setting up the core database, and it’s crucial since everything else depends on it.`
`Jessica: Right, let’s make sure we allocate enough time for that. By when do you think we can complete the third phase?` 
`James: If all goes well, we should complete the third phase, which includes all initial testing, by the end of April.` 
`Jessica: Perfect. For the BLANK, we should aim to have at least two weeks for beta testing and fixing any critical issues that our testers find. What’s the last task in that phase?`  
`James: The last, or BLANK, is to prepare the deployment documentation. We should have that ready near the last week of the project.`  
`Jessica: Excellent. I'll update our project timeline with these numbers and make sure everyone's clear about the order and deadlines. Thanks for the BLANK, James!`
