# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Specifically, BLANK of this portion is directed towards back-end development, which is crucial given our scalability goals.`

## --blanks--

`one-fourth`

### --feedback--

This is the correct way to say ¼ in words. Remember to use `-`.

# --explanation--

**Fractions** are used to describe parts of a whole.

`One-fourth` (¼) is one part out of four equal parts. Other examples:

- ½ = `one-half`

- ⅓ = `one-third`

- ¾ = `three-fourths`

In Alice's case, one-fourth of the development budget is spent on back-end development, which shows how money is divided within a category.
