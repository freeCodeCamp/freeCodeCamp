<!-- (Audio) Jessica: Hey James, I've been reviewing our project schedule, and I think we need to redefine our milestones. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Jessica want to do with the project milestones, and how sure is she about it?

## --answers--

She wants to cancel the project, and she sounds unsure.

### --feedback--

Jessica never mentions canceling the project. She only talks about changing part of the plan.

---

She wants to speed up the project, and she sounds very confident.

### --feedback--

Jessica doesn't say anything about speeding up the timeline, and her tone is thoughtful, not very confident.

---

She wants to keep everything the same, and she sounds completely sure.

### --feedback--

She actually suggests a change, not keeping things the same. The word `think` shows she is not completely sure.

---

She wants to change the milestones, and she is not completely sure about it.

# --explanation--

To answer this question, focus on two parts of the audio:

- What she wants to do: Listen for the verb that shows her intention. The word `redefine` is a clue that she wants to make a change to the milestones.

- How sure she is: The phrase `I think` shows sheâ€™s not 100% certain. These kinds of phrases often signal a suggestion or opinion, not a firm decision.
