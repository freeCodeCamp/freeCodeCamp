## --sentence--

`What BLANK our BLANK is still available for unforeseen expenses?`

## --blanks--

`fraction of`

### --feedback--

These two words mean "a part of a whole", especially when measured in portions or percentages.

---

`resources`

### --feedback--

This word in the plural form refers to money, time, people, or tools that are available to complete a project.

# --explanation--

A `fraction of` something means a part or portion of the total. For example:

`We used a fraction of the budget for testing.` - They spent only a small part of the money on tests.

`Resources` are the things you use to complete a project, such as budget, tools, people, or time. For example:

`The manager allocated more resources to speed up development.` - The manager gave extra help to make the work faster.

In David's sentence, he's asking how much of the total project budget or support is still left for unexpected costs.
