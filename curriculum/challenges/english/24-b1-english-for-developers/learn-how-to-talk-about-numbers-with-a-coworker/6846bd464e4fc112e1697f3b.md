# --explanation--

**Ordinal numbers** tell the position of something in a sequence, such as steps, tasks, or stages. Examples include: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, and so on.

To form most ordinal numbers, you take the **cardinal number** (1, 2, 3, 4...) and add the correct ending. For example, 1 becomes `first`, 2 becomes `second`, 3 becomes `third`, and 4 becomes `fourth`. Most ordinal numbers follow the pattern of adding `-th`, but 1st, 2nd, and 3rd are irregular.

In the dialogue, `the first task` means it is the first action that needs to be completed in the initial phase.
