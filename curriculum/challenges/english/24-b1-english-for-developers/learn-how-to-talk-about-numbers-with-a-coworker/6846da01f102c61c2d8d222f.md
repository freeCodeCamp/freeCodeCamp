Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`The BLANK involves setting up the core database, and it's crucial since everything else depends on it.`

## --blanks--

`third task`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase uses an ordinal number to show the task's position in a list or sequence.

# --explanation--

Remember, an **ordinal number** shows the order or position of something: `first`, `second`, `third`, etc.

In this case, `third task` tells you it is the third step in the list of ten tasks. Another example:

`The third task is to deploy the software.` â€” It's the step that comes after the second and before the fourth.
