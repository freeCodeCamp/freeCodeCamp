# --explanation--

`Core database` refers to the main or central data storage in a software system. It holds the key information that other parts of the system need. For example:
 
`All user information is stored in the core database.` — It's essential for the system to work.

`Crucial` means very important or essential. For example:

`It's crucial to test the login feature before launch.` — It's necessary to do this first.

James says the `core database` is `crucial` because everything else depends on it, which means that the project can't work without it.
