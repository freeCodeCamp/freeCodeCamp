Only five tablets exist in total.

Tom said there are ten in one place and another five somewhere else.

# --explanation--

`Another` before a number means an additional quantity. For example:

`We ordered another five laptops for the new team.` â€” They got 5 more laptops for the new team.
  
Tom already said there are ten tablets in one location, and now he's adding five more in a different place.
