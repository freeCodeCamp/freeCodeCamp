`Development` refers to the process of creating, building, or improving software, apps, or digital systems. It often includes activities like writing code, designing features, and testing and fixing bugs. For example:

- `We are in the early stages of product development.` - The product is still being created and improved.

- `Software development takes careful planning.` - Creating software is a step-by-step process.

A `development task` is a piece of work related to building or coding part of a software project.

Jessica wants to know how many `development tasks` are part of the second phase.
