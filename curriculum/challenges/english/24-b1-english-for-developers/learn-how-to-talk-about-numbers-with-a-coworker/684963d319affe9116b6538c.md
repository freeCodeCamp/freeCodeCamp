# --explanation--

`On average` means the typical amount something happens when you look at a time period as a whole. For example:

`On average, developers work 30 hours per week on the project.` - Usually, developers spend 30 hours weekly on the project.
 
It's useful when the exact number changes from week to week, but you want to show the usual pattern.
