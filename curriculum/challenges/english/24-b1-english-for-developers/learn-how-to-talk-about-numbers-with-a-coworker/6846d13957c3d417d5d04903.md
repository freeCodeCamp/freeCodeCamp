`second phase`

### --feedback--

The first word is an ordinal number that means the step after the first one, and the second word refers to a stage in a project.

# --explanation--

`Second` is an ordinal number that shows something comes after the first position in a sequence. For example:

`The second step is testing the software.` - It shows that this step comes after the first.

A `phase` is a part or stage of a project. So `second phase` means the second main part of the project plan.
