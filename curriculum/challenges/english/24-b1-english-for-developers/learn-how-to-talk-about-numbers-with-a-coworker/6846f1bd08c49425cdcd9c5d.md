To `aim` means to plan to reach a goal or target. For example:

`We aim to release the app next month.` - They hope or plan to do it.

`Beta testing` is when real users test a nearly finished product to find any bugs. For example:

`The app is now in beta testing.` - People are trying the app to find problems.

`Critical issues` are very serious problems that must be fixed before release. For example:

`The app crashing on login is a critical issue.` - It's a serious problem that blocks usage.
