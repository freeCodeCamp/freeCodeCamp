<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What could James say to answer Jessica’s question?

## --answers--

`Hi Jessica, we have four major phases.`

---

`Hi Jessica, the budget was approved yesterday.`

### --feedback--

This does not answer the question about how many phases are planned. It’s about the budget, which is a different topic.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

To answer a question that begins with `How many`, listen for a number or quantity in the reply. Jessica asks about the number of `phases`, so the correct answer should include both a number and the word `phases`.
