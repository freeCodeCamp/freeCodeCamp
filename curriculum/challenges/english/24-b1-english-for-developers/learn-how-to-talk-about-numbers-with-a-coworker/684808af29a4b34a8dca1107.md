# --explanation--

The `user interface` (often shortened to `UI`) is the visual and interactive part of a digital product - what users click, see, or touch. For example:

`The user interface includes the navigation bar and search field.` - The part of the app users see has things like the menu and the search box.

To `consume` means to use something up, like time, energy, or budget. For example:

`Testing often consumes a large part of the schedule.` - Testing usually takes a lot of time in the project plan.

Alice explains that UI design and front-end coding use up 27% of the budget - a significant portion.
