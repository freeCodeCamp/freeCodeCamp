# --explanation--

`Deployment` means releasing or launching software so it can be used in a real environment. For example:

`We're planning the next deployment for Thursday.` - The team will release new changes on Thursday.

`Documentation` is written information that helps explain how something works or how to use it. For example:

`The software needs better documentation.` - The instructions or user guide should be clearer.

Together, `deployment documentation` means the written steps and instructions needed to launch the software correctly.
