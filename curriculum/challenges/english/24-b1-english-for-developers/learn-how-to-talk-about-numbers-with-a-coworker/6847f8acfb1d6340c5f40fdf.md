# --explanation--

Alice says, `45% of our total budget has been allocated to the development phase`. This kind of sentence is common in project management when giving financial status updates or discussing resource planning. Other examples:

- `As of today, 60% of our budget has been used.` — By today, more than half of the money planned for the project has already been spent.

- `Only 10% of the timeline remains.` — There is very little time left to finish the project — just 10% of the planned time is left.

Sentences like these help clearly communicate project status using numbers and percentages.
