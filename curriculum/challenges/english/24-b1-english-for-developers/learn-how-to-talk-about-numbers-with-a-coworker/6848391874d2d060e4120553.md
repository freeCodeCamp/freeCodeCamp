# --explanation--

`Initial setup` means the first steps in a project — preparing systems, tools, and access before real work starts. For example: 

`The initial setup of the system took one day.` — The beginning part of installing the system took a day.

`Early development` refers to the beginning of the building process, often including prototypes or base functionality. For example:

`In early development, we focused on design.` — At the beginning, they worked mostly on how it looked.

In Alice's sentence, she's explaining that most of the money already spent went to these early project stages.
