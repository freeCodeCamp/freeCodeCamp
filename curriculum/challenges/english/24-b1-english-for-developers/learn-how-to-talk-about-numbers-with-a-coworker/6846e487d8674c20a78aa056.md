# --explanation--

Jessica asks, `By when...?` It's commonly used to ask when something will be finished. This is a polite way to ask for a time estimate or deadline. For example:

`By when do you need the report?` - What is the latest time you want the report?

James replies with a realistic and polite answer that shows he's not completely sure, but has a good estimate.
