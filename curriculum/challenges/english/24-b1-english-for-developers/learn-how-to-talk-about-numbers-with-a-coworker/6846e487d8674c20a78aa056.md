<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

James isn't completely sure about the end date. What could he say?

## --answers--

`I have no idea. It might never be ready.`

### --feedback--

This is too negative and unprofessional. Jessica is looking for an estimated timeline.

---

`If all goes well, we should complete the third phase by the end of April.`

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

Jessica asks, `By when...?` It's commonly used to ask when something will be finished. This is a polite way to ask for a time estimate or deadline. For example:

`By when do you need the report?` - What is the latest time you want the report?

James replies with a realistic and polite answer that shows he's not completely sure, but has a good estimate.
