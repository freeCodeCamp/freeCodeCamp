# --explanation--

A `strategy` is a plan of action designed to achieve a specific goal. In marketing or business, strategies are used to organize efforts and reach results efficiently. For example:

`The team developed a new marketing strategy to attract more users.` – This means they created a plan to increase user interest and engagement.

`Effective` means something that has a strong or successful result - it does what it's supposed to do. If something is not `effective`, it doesn't work as well as needed. For example:

`Their new email campaign was very effective.` – This means it produced good results, such as more clicks or sales.
