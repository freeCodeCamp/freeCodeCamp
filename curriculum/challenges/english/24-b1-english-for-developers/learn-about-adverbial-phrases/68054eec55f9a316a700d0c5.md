## --text--

While meeting with Bob, Sarah took notes of the important topics of their discussion.

`Meeting Focus: Making daily huddles more effective`

`Who: Bob and Sarah`

`Problem: Too much repetition in daily updates`

`Current Situation: Backend team meets every morning`

`Suggested Changes:`

- `Keep daily meetings, but shorter`

- `Add detailed updates only 2x per week (Tuesdays + Thursdays at 9 AM)`

- `Teams with fewer changes might meet weekly`

`Next Steps:`

- `Monitor how it works (me)`

- `Submit a report at the end of the month (me)`

- `Review the report and decide if more changes are needed (team)`

What is the main reason Bob wants to change the daily huddle meetings?
