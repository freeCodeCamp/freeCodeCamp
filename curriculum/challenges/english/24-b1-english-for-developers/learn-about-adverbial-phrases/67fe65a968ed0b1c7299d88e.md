# --explanation--

`The day before` is an adverbial phrase that refers to the previous day. It gives a sense of time, indicating that something happened one day before the current day. 

Be mindful that simply saying `yesterday` has to do with the day before `today`. You can use `the day before` to talk about a day preceding any day. For example:

`We discussed the new feature the day before.` â€“ This means the discussion occurred the previous day to the day being discussed.

In contrast, saying `yesterday`, as in `We discussed the new feature yesterday.`, specifically means it happened the day before today.
