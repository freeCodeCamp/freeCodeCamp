# --explanation--

`To be good for something` means to be suitable or appropriate for a specific purpose or situation. For example:

- `This laptop is good for graphic design work.` – This means the laptop has the right features or performance needed for graphic design tasks.

- `This room is good for small team meetings.` – This means the room is suitable in size and setup for a small group to meet.

In this context, it means the servers are performing well enough to handle the current level of usage or demand.
