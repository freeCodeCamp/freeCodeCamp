## --sentence--

`Riker: Good morning, Maria. I've prepared the final report on our recent BLANK. It really helped increase our BLANK levels, especially in Europe.`

`Maria: That's great. How much did our engagement improve? Did we reach our targets?`

`Riker: Yes, our engagement went up by about 40%. That's a big increase. The UK and Germany saw the most improvement, even more than we expected.`

`Maria: That's BLANK. What about our budget? Did we stay within it?`

`Riker: We went over budget by just 5%, which isn't too much. The ads cost more than we thought they would.`

`Maria: I see. Where could we do better? Which areas didn't BLANK completely?`

`Riker: Our campaign did well in Europe, but not as much in Asia. The impact there was quite low. We need better content that fits each local market.`

`Maria: Right. We should improve our BLANK in areas where they weren't very effective. And for our next campaign, how can we manage our budget better?`

`Riker: I think we should plan our budget based on different regions' costs. We need to BLANK more wisely to avoid going over budget.`

`Maria: Excellent. Can you write a new strategy based on our talk today and share it at our next team meeting? It's important that we use what we've learned to improve.`

`Riker: Okay, Maria. I'll get a detailed plan ready and go over it with the team to BLANK.`
