## --sentence--

`I see. Where could we do better? Which BLANK didn't meet our BLANK completely?`

## --blanks--

`areas`

### --feedback--

This refers to parts or sections of a project, activity, or focus, such as marketing, communication, or design. Use the plural form.

---

`expectations`

### --feedback--

This refers to what someone hoped or believed would happen — their goals, standards, or predictions. Use the plural form.

# --explanation--

An `area` refers to a specific part or aspect of something, like a task, department, or focus in a project. In this sentence, Maria is asking which parts of the project didn't perform as well as expected. For example:

`Customer service is one area we need to improve.` – This means the customer service part of the business needs more attention.

`To meet expectations` means to perform as well as was hoped or predicted. Not doing so means something didn't succeed the way people thought it would. For example:

`The app didn't meet user expectations because of bugs.` – This means users expected a better experience than what they got.
