# --explanation--

`To review` means to look at or examine something in order to understand it better or to check for mistakes. In this sentence, Sarah means that the team looks at their progress and any issues to understand the current situation and possibly make improvements. For example:

`We need to review the report before submitting it.` â€“ This means they will examine the report to check for errors or improve it before sending it out.
