# --explanation--

`To do better` means to improve performance or results compared to a past effort or expectation. Maria is asking which parts of the campaign could be improved. For example:

- `We need to do better in our customer response times.` – This means the team should improve how quickly they reply to customers.

- `He did better on the second test than the first.` – This means his performance improved in the second attempt.
