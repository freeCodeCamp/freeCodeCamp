# --explanation--

`To be enough` means to be sufficient or adequate to meet a requirement or need. For example:

`A simple explanation is enough to clarify the situation.` – This means the explanation is sufficient to help understand the situation.

In this case, Bob believes that a quick status check will be sufficient for the daily meetings, and detailed updates are not necessary.

`We don't need a big team for this project; a few experienced members will be enough.` – This means that having only a few people with the right experience is sufficient to complete the project.
