## --blanks--

### --feedback--

---

`twice`

### --feedback--

This refers to something happening two times within a specified period.

# --explanation--

`To limit something` means to reduce or restrict the quantity, frequency, or extent of something. In this context, Sarah is suggesting that the full team updates should be reduced or restricted to only twice a week. For example:

`We should limit the number of meetings to avoid overloading the team.` – This means reducing the number of meetings to prevent too much time spent in them.

`Twice a week` means two times every week. It indicates the frequency of an event or action. For example:

`The team meets twice a week to discuss progress.` – This means the team gathers two times per week to have discussions.

**Important**: `twice a week` clarifies that an event is going to happen two times in the same week. It is preferable to `biweekly`, since the latter might be understood as happening every two weeks, or twice a month. In this dialog, however, both Sarah and Bob seem to have a common understanding of `biweekly` meaning the same as `twice a week`.
