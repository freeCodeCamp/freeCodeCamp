# --explanation--

`To write something up` or `to write up something` means to prepare a written version of information, often in a clear and organized way. It's commonly used for creating reports, summaries, or plans. For example:

- `I'll write up the meeting notes and send them out.` – This means you will organize and document the notes to share with others.

- `She wrote up a summary of the test results.` – This means she created a clear written report of the results.
