# --explanation--

`That works (for me/us)` is a common way to show that you agree with or accept a suggestion, especially when talking about plans, times, or schedules. It means the suggestion fits well or is convenient. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's meet at 3 p.m. tomorrow.` - Person 1 proposes a time for a meeting.

- Person 2: `That works for me.` â€“ This means the second person is okay with the time suggested.
