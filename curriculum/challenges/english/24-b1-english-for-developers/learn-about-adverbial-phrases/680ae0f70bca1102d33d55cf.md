# --explanation--

`To go up` means to increase or rise in number, level, or amount. It is often used in business, prices, statistics, or performance discussions. For example:

- `Prices usually go up before the holidays.` – This means prices increase regularly during that time.

- `Sales went up after the product launch.` – This means sales increased in the past, after the launch happened.

Here, `went` is the `Simple Past` form of the irregular verb `go`.
