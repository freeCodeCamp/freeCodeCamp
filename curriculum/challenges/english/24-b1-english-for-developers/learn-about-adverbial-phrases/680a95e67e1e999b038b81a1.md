# --explanation--

A `final report` is a complete and finished document that summarizes the results, progress, or findings of a project, event, or activity. It is usually created at the end of a task to review what was done and what was learned. For example:

`The final report showed that the training program improved employee performance.` â€“ This means the report gave a summary of results after the training program ended.
