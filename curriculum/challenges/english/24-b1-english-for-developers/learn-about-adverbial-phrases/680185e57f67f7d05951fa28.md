# --explanation--

`How about` followed by a verb in the `-ing` form is a common way to make a suggestion. It introduces an idea in a friendly and informal way. The verb that follows is in the gerund form because it acts like a noun in the sentence. For example:

`How about starting the meeting a little earlier tomorrow?` â€“ This means the speaker is suggesting to begin the meeting earlier.
