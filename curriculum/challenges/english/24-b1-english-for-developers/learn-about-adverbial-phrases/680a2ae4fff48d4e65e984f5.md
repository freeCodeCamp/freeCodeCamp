<!-- (Audio) James: True. Do you think we might face any big problems with how fast it responds on different servers? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What could Sophie say to show James that his concern makes sense?

## --answers--

`That won't happen at all.`

### --feedback--

This dismisses the concern completely, which isn't supportive of what James is asking.

---

`It's possible.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`It's possible` is a polite and open-ended way to respond to a question that starts with `Do you think we might...?`. It shows that the speaker thinks the situation could happen and is worth considering, but they're not giving a definite answer.

In this case, James is asking if there might be problems with the app's performance on different servers. By saying `It's possible`, Sophie shows she understands and accepts the concern as reasonable.

Another example:  

- Person 1: `Do you think we might run into issues with the new system?` - This person is asking if there's the chance of issues happening when the new system is used.

- Person 2: `It's possible. Let's test it more before launch.` - This shows understanding without overreacting or making assumptions.
