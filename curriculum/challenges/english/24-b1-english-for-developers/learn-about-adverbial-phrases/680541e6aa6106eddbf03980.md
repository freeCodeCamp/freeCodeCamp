# --explanation--

`To meet someone's needs` means to satisfy or fulfill the requirements or expectations of a person, group, or situation. In this sentence, Bob is saying that the team will review whether the changes are actually helping or solving the problem. For example:

`The new software update meets our needs better than the old version.` – This means the update works well for what the team requires.

`Further` in this context means additional or more. It refers to possible extra changes that might be needed after reviewing the current ones. For example:

`If the issue continues, we may need to take further action.` – This means more action will be required beyond what has already been done.
