# --explanation--

`Especially` is used to show that something is more true, more important, or more noticeable in one particular case than in others. For example:

`She enjoys all sports, especially tennis.` â€“ This means she likes sports in general, but tennis is her favorite or the one she enjoys the most.

Here, it means that engagement increased everywhere, but it was most noticeable in Europe.
