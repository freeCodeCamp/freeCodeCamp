# --explanation--

`To focus on something` means to give your full attention or effort to one specific task or goal. For example:

`She wants to focus on improving her coding skills this month.` – This means she will spend most of her time and energy on getting better at coding.

`To optimize` means to make something as good, fast, or efficient as possible. For example:

`We need to optimize our website for mobile users.` – This means the team should improve how the website works on mobile phones.
