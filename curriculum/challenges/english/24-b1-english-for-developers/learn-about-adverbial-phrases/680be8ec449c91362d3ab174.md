# --explanation--

Here, `to` introduces the purpose or goal of the action - it shows that the team should use their experience aiming at improving. For example:

- `We are studying harder to pass the exam.` – This means the purpose of studying harder is to succeed in the exam.

- `She practices speaking every day to become more fluent.` – This means her goal of practicing is to speak English better.
