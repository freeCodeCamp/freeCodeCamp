# --explanation--

`Which` is used to introduce a non-defining relative clause - a sentence that gives more information about the whole idea before it. It adds extra detail, but it's not essential to the main meaning of the sentence. For example:

`She missed the deadline, which surprised everyone.` â€“ The clause adds extra information about how people reacted to her missing the deadline (the part that mattered most in the sentence).

In the context, Riker uses `which` to state his opinion about the extra expenditure, an extra piece of information in relation to the amount over budget - what Maria really asked about.
