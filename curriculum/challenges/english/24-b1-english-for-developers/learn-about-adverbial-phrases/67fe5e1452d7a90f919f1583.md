`To be honest` is used when someone wants to speak truthfully or directly, often about something they might not otherwise say. It signals that the speaker is being open or sincere about their opinion. For example:

`To be honest, I think we need more time to finish the project.` – Here, you're giving your sincere opinion.

`To end up doing something` means to eventually do something, often as a result of a series of events or actions, sometimes unexpectedly. It suggests that the outcome wasn't planned. For example:

`We planned to visit the museum, but we ended up going to the park instead.` – This means the team originally intended to go to the museum but eventually went to the park due to some reason or change of plans.
