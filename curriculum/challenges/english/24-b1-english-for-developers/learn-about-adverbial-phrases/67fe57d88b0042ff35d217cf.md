# --explanation--

An **adverbial phrase** is a word or group of words that works together to modify a verb, adjective, or other adverb, providing additional information about time, frequency, manner, place, or degree. Sarah uses two adverbial phrases that describe the frequency of the meeting:

`Currently` is an adverb that refers to the present time. It indicates that the action is happening now, in the present moment. For example:

`Currently, we are testing the new software.` - It means the testing is happening at the present time.

`Every morning` is an adverbial phrase that describes frequency, indicating how often the meetings occur. For example:

`She exercises every morning before work.` - It means she exercises daily, specifically in the morning.

These phrases help provide more context and give the listener or reader a better understanding of when and how frequently the actions take place.
