# --explanation--

`Workflow` refers to the sequence of tasks or steps that are followed to complete a process or job. It helps describe how work moves from start to finish in an organized way. For example:

`We're trying to improve our workflow to speed up delivery times.` – This means the team wants to make the steps more efficient to deliver faster.

`To compile` means to collect and organize information into a single document or report. It often refers to putting data, results, or ideas together in one place. For example:

`She compiled all the feedback from the team into one summary.` – This means she gathered different pieces of feedback and organized them into a clear, single document.
