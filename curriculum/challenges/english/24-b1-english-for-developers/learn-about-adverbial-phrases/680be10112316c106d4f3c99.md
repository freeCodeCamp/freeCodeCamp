# --explanation--

`To spread` in this context means to distribute something over a wider area or across different parts. For example:

`The team spread the project tasks evenly among all members.` – This means the work was divided fairly so that each person had a similar amount to do.

`Funds` refers to money that is available for a specific purpose, like a project, campaign, or event. For example:

`The company set aside special funds for emergency expenses.` – This means they reserved money to be used only if unexpected problems happen.
