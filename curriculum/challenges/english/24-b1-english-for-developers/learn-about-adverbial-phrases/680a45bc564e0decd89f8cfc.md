# --explanation--

`To look at something` in this context means to review, examine, or go over something carefully, often to check for correctness or make a decision. It's a common phrase used in planning or collaboration. For example:

- `Let's look at the report before we send it out.` – This means to review the report and make sure everything is correct or clear.

- `We looked at the feedback from users and made some improvements.` – This means they examined the feedback closely and used it to make changes.
