# --explanation--

`Not as much` is a comparative expression used to show that something happens or exists to a lesser degree than something else. For example:

- `She studies a lot, but not as much as her brother.` – This means she studies less than her brother does, even though she studies a lot.

- `The first product sold well, but not as much as the second one.` – This means the second product had better sales than the first, even though the first product sold well.
