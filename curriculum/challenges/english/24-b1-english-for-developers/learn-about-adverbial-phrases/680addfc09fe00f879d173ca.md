# --explanation--

`To reach the target` means to successfully achieve a planned goal or result, especially one that has been set in advance. This is often used in business, marketing, or sales. For example:

- `The team reached its target of 10,000 downloads in one week.` – This means they met the goal they had set for downloads.

- `We reached our fundraising target thanks to everyone's support.` – This means they collected the amount of money they planned to raise.
