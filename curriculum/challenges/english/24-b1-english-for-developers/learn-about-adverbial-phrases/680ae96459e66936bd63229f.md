# --explanation--

`What about...` is a phrase used to ask for information or raise a new topic related to what was just discussed. It's often used to shift focus or check on a different aspect of something. For example:

- `We finished the presentation. What about the handouts?` – This means the speaker is asking whether the handouts are ready or if they've been considered.

- `That plan sounds good. What about the timeline?` – This means the speaker agrees with the idea but wants to ask about how long it will take.
