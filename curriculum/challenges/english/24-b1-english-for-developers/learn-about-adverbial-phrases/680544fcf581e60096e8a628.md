# --explanation--

The structure `as` + adjective + `as possible` is used to compare or emphasize the degree of something. It is useful when setting goals or describing ideal conditions.

By `as productive as possible`, for instance, Bob means the meetings should reach the highest level of productivity they can. Another example:

`We want the launch to be as smooth as possible.` â€“ This means they want the launch to go very smoothly, with no problems.
