# --explanation--

`To get someone's thoughts` means to ask for their ideas, opinions, or feedback about something. It shows that the speaker wants to hear what others think before making a decision or moving forward. For example:

- `Before launching the new product, we should get the customers' thoughts.` – This means asking customers for feedback and ideas before the launch.

- `I sent my draft to my manager to get her thoughts on it.` – This means you wanted feedback or advice from the manager.
