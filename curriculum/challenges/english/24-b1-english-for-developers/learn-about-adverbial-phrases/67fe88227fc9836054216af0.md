# --explanation--

`Bi-weekly` means occurring every two weeks. It is used to describe something that happens twice a month, with roughly a two-week gap between occurrences. For example:

- `The team holds a bi-weekly meeting to discuss progress.` – This means the meeting occurs once every two weeks.

- `We receive bi-weekly updates on the project's status.` – This means updates are given every two weeks.
