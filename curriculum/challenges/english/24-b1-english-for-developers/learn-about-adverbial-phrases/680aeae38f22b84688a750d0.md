# --explanation--

`To be within budget` or `to stay within budget` means to spend only the amount of money that was planned or allowed and no more. It shows that the project or activity is managed well financially. For example:

`The team stayed within budget, so we didn't need extra funding.` â€“ This means they did not spend more than what was originally planned.
