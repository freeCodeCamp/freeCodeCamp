A `status check` refers to reviewing or checking the current condition or progress of something. It typically involves a brief update to understand how things are going. For example:

`We will do a quick status check at the start of each meeting to ensure everything is on track.` – This means checking the progress of the tasks or project at the beginning of each meeting.
