After talking to Sophie, James comes up with an initial draft for their plan. Here's what he wrote:

`Title: Draft Plan â€“ Chat Feature Rollout`

`Here is a first version of the plan for launching the new chat feature. The goal is to make sure it works well for all users, no matter where they are. These are the main steps we can follow:`

1. `Test with Central Servers: Start by testing the feature on our current central servers. Check if it works smoothly in our main environment.`

2. `Try Different Locations: Test the chat feature in different regions. This will help us see if response times stay fast around the world.`

3. `Watch for Delays: Pay attention to any slow response times. The new feature might increase server load and cause delays at first.`

4. `Start Small: Launch the feature for a small group of users. This lets us see how it performs without affecting everyone.`

5. `Fix Issues Early: If we find problems, fix them before expanding. This helps us improve the system step by step.`

6. `Increase User Group: Slowly add more users after each round of testing. This helps us understand system limits better.`

7. `Review and Adjust: After testing, we'll look at the full plan again. If needed, we can change parts of it before the full launch.`

`Let's go over this together and decide if any steps need updates.`
