# --explanation--

Bob asks Sarah to provide information about the frequency of the team's discussions.

Notice that the question `How often does the team currently discuss back-end development?` changes its word order when it becomes the object of another question. Subject and verb are reversed from the original interrogative format.

In other words, when you use a question as the object of another question, you change the word order to an affirmative form. For example:

- `How often does he travel for work?` becomes `Can you tell me how often he travels for work?` - The question now is `Can you tell me...?`

- `What time does the meeting start?` becomes `Do you know what time the meeting starts?` - The question now is `Do you know...?`

In both cases, the auxiliary verb `does` is dropped and the subject and verb are inverted into an affirmative statement format when used as the object of another question.
