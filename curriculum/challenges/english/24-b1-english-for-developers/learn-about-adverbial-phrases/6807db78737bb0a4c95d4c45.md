`As we start on the new chat BLANK, we need to make sure it BLANK well everywhere.`

## --blanks--

`feature`

### --feedback--

This refers to a part or function of a product, especially in software.

---

`works`

### --feedback--

This means to functioning or operating. Use `-s` in the end, since it's third person.

# --explanation--

A `feature` is a specific part or function of a product, especially in apps or software. `Features` are what make a product useful or interesting. For example:

`The new update includes a search feature that helps users find content quickly.` – This means the app now has a tool for searching.

`To work well` means to function effectively, without problems, and in the way it is supposed to. For example:

`The app works well on both Android and iOS devices.` – This means the app runs smoothly and correctly on both platforms.
