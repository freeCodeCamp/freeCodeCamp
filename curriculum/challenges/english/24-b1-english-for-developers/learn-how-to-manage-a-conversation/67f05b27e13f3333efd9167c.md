# --questions--

## --text--

## --answers--

`Not yet.`

---

`We will see.`

### --feedback--

This is too general. It doesn't directly respond to Sarah's question about the timeline.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Not yet.` is a common short answer used to say that something hasn't happened or been decided at this moment in time, but it may happen in the future. It's often used when something is expected but not confirmed. For example:

- Person 1: `Have they sent the report?` - This person is asking if the other has already received a report.

- Person 2: `Not yet.` â€“ This means the report hasn't been sent, but it might be sent soon.
