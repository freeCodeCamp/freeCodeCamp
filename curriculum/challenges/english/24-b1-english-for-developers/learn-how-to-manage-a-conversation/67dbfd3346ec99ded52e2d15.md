# --explanation--

`Earlier` is the comparative form of `early`. It is often used to compare two points in time, but in this case, it simply refers to a moment before the current conversation. For example:

`I called you earlier, but you didn't pick up.` - Here, `earlier` means "at a previous time" without specifying a comparison (`earlier than now`, for instance).

The same situation normally applies to the comparative form of `late`: `later`. For example:

`I'll see you later.` - Here, `later` means "at a time in the future". The comparison (`later than now`, for instance) is omitted.
