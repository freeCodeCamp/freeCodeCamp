# --explanation--

`Go ahead` is a phrase used to give someone permission to begin or continue with something. It shows approval in a friendly way. For example:

- Person 1: `Can I ask a question?` — This person is asking for authorization to do something.

- Person 2: `Sure, go ahead.` – This means person 1 is allowed to ask their question now.
