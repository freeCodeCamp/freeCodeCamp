# --explanation--

Phrasal verbs are verbs combined with prepositions or adverbs that create a new meaning. In this part of the dialogue, you see the difference between `to send something` and `to send something over`.

`To send something` means to make something go from one place or person to another, whereas `to send something over` adds the idea of delivery to a person or place, often informally or digitally. Take a look at one example of each:

- `I'll send the letter tomorrow.` - A basic statement of transferring something.

- `Can you send over the file by email?` - This emphasizes sending something *to someone*, usually over a short distance or digitally. The addition of `over` makes the phrase sound more natural in casual conversation.
