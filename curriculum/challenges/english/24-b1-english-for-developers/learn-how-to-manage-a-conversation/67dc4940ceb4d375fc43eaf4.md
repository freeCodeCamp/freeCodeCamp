# --explanation--

`Does that work for you?` is a polite way to ask if something is acceptable or convenient for someone. It is often used in professional and casual conversations to check for agreement. For example:

`We can schedule the meeting for Monday. Does that work for you?` - This asks if Monday is a good time for the other person.
