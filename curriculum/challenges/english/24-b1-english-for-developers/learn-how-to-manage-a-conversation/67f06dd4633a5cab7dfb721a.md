# --explanation--

`Not for now` means that there's nothing more to say or do at the present time, but it doesn't close the door to discussing more in the future. It's a polite way to pause or end a conversation. For example:

- Person 1: `Do you have any questions?`

- Person 2: `Not for now, thanks.` â€“ This means the person has no questions at the moment, but might have some later.
