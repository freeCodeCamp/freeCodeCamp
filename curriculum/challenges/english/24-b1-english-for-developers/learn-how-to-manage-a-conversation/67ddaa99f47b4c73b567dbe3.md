# --explanation--

`Sure thing.` is an informal and friendly way to say `Of course` or `I'll do it`. It shows that the speaker agrees to the request without hesitation. For example:

- Person 1: `Can you send me the file this afternoon?` - This person is asking for a file. 

- Person 2: `Sure thing.` - This means the speaker agrees and will send the file as requested.
