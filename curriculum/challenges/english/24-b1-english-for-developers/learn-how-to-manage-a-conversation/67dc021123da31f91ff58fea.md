# --explanation--

Phrasal verbs are combinations of a verb with a particle that create a new meaning different from the original verb by itself. For example:

- `To pick` means to select or take something. `To pick up`, however, means to continue something.

- `To leave` means to go away from a place, but `to leave off` means to stop something.

Another example:

`Turn on the light, please.` - Here, `to turn on` means to activate something. By itself, `to turn` simply means to change direction.

Phrasal verbs are frequently used in everyday conversations, even in more formal situations. They are used to express a lot of actions and ideas in a concise and natural way, so learning them will help you express your thoughts in ways that will sound more natural to native speakers.
