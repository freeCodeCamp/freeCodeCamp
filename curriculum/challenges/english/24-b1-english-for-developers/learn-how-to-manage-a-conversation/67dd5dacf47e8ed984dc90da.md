## --answers--

`Not yet.`

---

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Not yet.` is a short and natural way to say that something hasn't happened or been completed up to the present moment, but it may happen in the future. For example:

- Person 1: `Have you sent the email?` - Here, the person is asking about an email that should be sent.

- Person 2: `Not yet.` â€“ This means the email hasn't been sent, but that the person still plans to send it.
