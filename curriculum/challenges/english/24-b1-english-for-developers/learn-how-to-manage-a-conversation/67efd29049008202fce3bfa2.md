# --explanation--

`I wanted to` is a polite way to express a desire or intention. When starting a request, it shows that you are thinking about what the other person might do or respond to. For example:

`I wanted to ask if you could help me with this task.` â€“ In this example, the speaker is politely expressing their desire for help in the past, but the request is still valid.
