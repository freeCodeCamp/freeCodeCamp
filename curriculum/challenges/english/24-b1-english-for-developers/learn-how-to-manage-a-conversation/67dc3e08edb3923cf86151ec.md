<!-- (Audio) James: Sure, Alice. We were talking about the new project requirements, right? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What could Alice say to confirm the topic they were discussing?

## --answers--

`Yes, that's right.`

---

`I don't remember.`

### --feedback--

This does not confirm the topic of discussion.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`That` in `Yes, that's right.` is used to refer to something previously mentioned by the other speaker. It acts as a pronoun replacing the entire idea of what James said. Another example:

- Person 1: `The meeting is at 3 PM, right?` - This person is affirming something (the time of the meeting) and asking for confirmation. 

- Person 2: `Yes, that's correct.` - Here, `that` refers to what person 1 affirmed (`The meeting is at 3 PM`).
