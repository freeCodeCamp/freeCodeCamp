# --explanation--

`Good point` is a short and positive phrase used to show that you agree with someone's idea or opinion. It means you think what the person said is logical or useful. For example:

- Person 1: `We should save time by preparing the slides in advance.` - Person A brings an idea to the table - preparing for an upcoming presentation.

- Person 2: `Good point.` â€“ This shows the speaker agrees and values the suggestion.
