Saying `Absolutely` is a strong, enthusiastic way to agree with a suggestion. In response to a question like `Would that help?`, it is like saying `Yes, that would definitely help`. For example:

- Person A: `Can I send you the report by noon?` - The person is offering to send the report at a proposed time.

- Person B: `Absolutely.` – Person B shows full agreement with no hesitation.
