# --questions--

## --text--

What could Sarah say to tell Brian that the meeting would be helpful?

## --answers--

`Not really.`

### --feedback--

This means the meeting would not be helpful.

---

`Absolutely.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Saying `Absolutely` is a strong, enthusiastic way to agree with a suggestion. In response to a question like `Would that help?`, it is like saying `Yes, that would definitely help`. For example:

- Person 1: `Can I send you the report by noon?` - The person is offering to send the report at a proposed time.

- Person 2: `Absolutely.` â€“ Person B shows full agreement with no hesitation.
