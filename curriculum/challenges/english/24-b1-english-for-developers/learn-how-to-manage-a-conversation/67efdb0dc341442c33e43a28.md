# --explanation--

`Everything` is treated as a singular noun, even though it refers to multiple things. In sentences like `How is everything?` or `Everything's fine`, the verb is in the third person singular form because `everything` is considered a singular subject. For example:

`Everything is ready for the presentation.` â€“ Even though `everything` refers to multiple items or tasks, it uses the singular verb `is`.
