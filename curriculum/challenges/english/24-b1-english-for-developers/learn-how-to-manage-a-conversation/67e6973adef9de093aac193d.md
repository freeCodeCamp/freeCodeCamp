# --explanation--

`The rest of something` means the remaining part or people not yet mentioned. For example:

`She finished the report and emailed the rest of the documents.` – This means she sent the remaining documents that hadn't been sent yet.

`To handle something` means to take responsibility for or deal with a task or problem. For example:

`I'll handle the client meeting this afternoon.` – This means the speaker will take care of the meeting.
