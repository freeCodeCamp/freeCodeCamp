# --questions--

## --text--

## --answers--

`I'm not sure.`

### --feedback--

`That should work.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`That should work.` is a common way to agree with a suggestion. It means the idea sounds acceptable or possible, even if it's not 100% confirmed. For example:

- Person 1: `Can we meet at 3 PM tomorrow?` - This person is suggesting a time to meet on the following day.

- Person 2: `That should work.` - This means the time is likely okay for them to meet.
