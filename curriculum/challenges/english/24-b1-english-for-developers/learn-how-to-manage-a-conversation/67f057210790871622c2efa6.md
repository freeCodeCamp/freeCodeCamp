# --explanation--

`Though` is used to contrast two ideas. It often shows that something is happening despite a difficulty or unexpected situation. In this case, it shows that even though there are problems, the team is still working on them. For example:  

`The task is difficult. I'm going to finish it, though.` â€“ This means the person will complete the task despite the difficulty.
