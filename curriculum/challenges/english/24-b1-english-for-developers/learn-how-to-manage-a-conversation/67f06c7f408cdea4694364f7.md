# --explanation--

`I'll` is the contraction of `I will` and is often used to make a decision or promise at the moment of speaking. 

In this sentence, `I'll send you the details` is a promise Brian is making to take action. Another example: 

`I'll call you later with the results.` â€“ This means the speaker is promising to call at a later time to give more information.
