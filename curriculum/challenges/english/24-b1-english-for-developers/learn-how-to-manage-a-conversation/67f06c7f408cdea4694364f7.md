# --explanation--

`I'll` is the contraction of `I will` and is often used to make a decision or promise at the moment of speaking. In this sentence, `I'll send you the details` is a promise Brian is making to take action.

For example:  
`I'll call you later with the results.` – This means the speaker is promising to call at a later time to give more information.
