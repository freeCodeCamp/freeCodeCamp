# --explanation--

`What do you think about...` is often used to make a polite suggestion, not just to ask for an opinion. It invites the other person to respond or give input on a possible plan. For example:

`What do you think about moving the meeting to Friday?` â€“ This is a polite way to suggest changing the meeting day. Instead of asking if the other person likes or dislikes the plan, you are actually suggesting moving the meeting to another date.
