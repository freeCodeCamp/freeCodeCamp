# --explanation--

`To take long` means that something requires more time than was initially planned or expected. It's used to talk about the duration of something. When you say something is `longer than expected` emphasizes that something is taking more time than anticipated. The comparative form of `long` (`longer`) is used to compare the actual time taken with what was expected or planned. For example:

- `The delivery took longer than planned.` – This means the delivery required more time than originally expected.

- `The journey took longer than expected due to traffic.` – This means the journey lasted more time than they thought it would.
