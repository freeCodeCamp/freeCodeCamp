# --explanation--

In casual spoken language, you often leave out words when the meaning is still clear. In this case, `Anything else we should discuss?` is a shortened form of `Is there anything else we should discuss?`. This kind of omission is common in conversation. Another example:

`Need any help?` is a shorter way to say `Do you need any help?` â€“ The subject and auxiliary verb are left out, but the meaning stays the same.
