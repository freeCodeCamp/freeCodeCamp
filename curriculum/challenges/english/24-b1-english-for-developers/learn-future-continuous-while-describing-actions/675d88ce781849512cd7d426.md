`The support team resolved over 50 support tickets this week.` - It means more than 50 issues reported by users were addressed by the support team.

`Piling up` means accumulating or gathering in a large quantity, often more than expected or manageable. For example:

`The homework assignments are piling up as the deadline approaches.` - This example highlights how the number of homework assignments is growing significantly, creating a sense of urgency or pressure.
