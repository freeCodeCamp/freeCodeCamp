## --sentence--

`Hey Mark, we've been having some trouble with our BLANK, haven't we?`

## --blanks--

`user authentication`

### --feedback--

This phrase of two words refers to the process of verifying a user's identity to allow access to a system or resource.

# --explanation--

`User authentication` is the process of verifying that a user is who they claim to be. It typically involves entering a username and password, scanning a fingerprint, or using another method to confirm identity. For example:

`Our company uses two-factor user authentication. Users must enter their password and a code sent to their phone to log in.` - This means that the company adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two separate pieces of information — a password and a code — to verify their identity and gain access to the system.
