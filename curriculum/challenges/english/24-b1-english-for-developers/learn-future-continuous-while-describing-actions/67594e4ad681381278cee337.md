### --feedback--

`we`

### --feedback--

This word is the subject of the tag question, matching the subject of the main sentence.

# --explanation--

Tag questions are short questions added to the end of a sentence. They are used to confirm information or ask for agreement. A tag question includes a helping verb and a pronoun that matches the subject of the main sentence. The verb in the tag question must match the verb tense of the main sentence.

`Haven't` and `hasn't` are negative contractions of `have` and `has`, used in tag questions to confirm or check information. 

Use `haven't` when the subject is plural (like `we` or `they`) or when the subject is `I`. Use `hasn't` when the subject is singular (like `he`, `she`, or `it`). For example:

- `We've been working hard, haven't we?` - The main sentence uses `we've` (`we have`), so the tag question uses `haven't we?` to confirm the statement.

- `She's finished her report, hasn't she?` - The main sentence uses `she's` (`she has`), so the tag question uses `hasn't she?` to confirm the statement.
