<!-- (audio) Mark: That seems to be the case. The system is supposed to renew tokens every 30 minutes, isn't it? -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`That seems to be the case. The system is supposed to BLANK tokens every 30 minutes, BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`renew`

### --feedback--

It means to make something valid again or to refresh it.

---

`isn't it`

### --feedback--

These two words form a tag question that confirms or checks the information in the main sentence. The first word is contraction of `is not`.

# --explanation--

`Renew` means to refresh, extend, or restore something to its original condition. For example:

`The subscription needs to renew every year.` - It means to extend or refresh the subscription to keep it active for another year, similar to how tokens need to be refreshed every 30 minutes.

`Isn't it` is used in tag questions to confirm or check information. For example:

`The UI is nice, isn't it?` - The main statement is positive, so the tag question is negative. It asks for confirmation that the UI is, indeed, nice.
