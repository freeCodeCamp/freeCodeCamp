<!-- (audio) Alice: The tokens aren't being refreshed properly, are they? -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`The tokens aren't being refreshed properly, BLANK BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`are`

### --feedback--

This word is part of the tag question and matches `aren't` from the main sentence.

---

`they`

### --feedback--

This word refers to the subject `tokens` in the main sentence and ensures the tag question agrees with it.

# --explanation--

Tag questions are negative if the main sentence is positive, and positive if the main sentence is negative.

The phrase `are they?` is a tag question added to the end of a negative sentence to confirm or check information. For example:

`The updates aren't applied automatically, are they?` - Here, `are they?` checks for confirmation that updates are not being applied automatically. The main sentence is negative, so the tag question is positive.
