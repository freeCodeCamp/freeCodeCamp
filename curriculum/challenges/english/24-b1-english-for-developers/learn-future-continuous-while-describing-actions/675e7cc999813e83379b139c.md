Mark spoke to the team about the importance of solving login problems and keeping users satisfied:

`Team, user authentication is one of the most critical parts of our system, isn't it? When users start complaining about login issues, we need to investigate session management and check if the tokens are being refreshed properly. If the tokens aren't renewed on time, users may lose access or face frustrating errors, and we don't want that, do we?`

`The first step is to analyze the server logs. If we can't find the cause in the logs, the next step is to replicate the issue on a staging server. Testing on a staging server is safe because it allows us to try different solutions without affecting the live system.`

`When login problems continue, support tickets will start piling up, won't they? Solving these issues quickly is not just about fixing the system â€” it's also about maintaining user trust and satisfaction, isn't it? Let's work together, find the root cause, and resolve this problem efficiently.`
