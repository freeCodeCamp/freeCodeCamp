The expression `stuck on` is used to describe a situation where someone is unable to make progress or solve an issue. It emphasizes being trapped or halted in a task. For example:

- `I was stuck on that tricky math problem for hours.` - The problem made me waste a long time.

- `We got stuck on deciding the best solution to the project's issues.` - We did not know the best solution and it took us a long time to find it.

In this sentence, Lisa is referring to a bug they couldn't solve or fix the day before.
