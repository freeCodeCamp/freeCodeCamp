## --sentence--

## --blanks--

`catch`

### --feedback--

Combined with the following word, it's a phrase that Brian uses to suggest talking with Maria about what they've both been up to recently.

# --explanation--

`Catch up` means to meet and update each other on recent events or activities after some time apart. For examples:

- `She stayed late to catch up on her tasks.` - Meaning she worked longer to finish tasks she was behind on.

- `Let's catch up during the meeting tomorrow.` - Meaning you and the other person can talk and update each other at the meeting.

In this context, Brian is telling Maria that they should talk to each other to know what they've been doing.
