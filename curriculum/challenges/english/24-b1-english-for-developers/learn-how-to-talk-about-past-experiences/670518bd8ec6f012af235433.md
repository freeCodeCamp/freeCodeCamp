## --sentence--

`First, I BLANK the recent changes we BLANK to the code.`

## --blanks--

`checked`

### --feedback--

This is the `Simple Past` form of the regular verb `check`, formed by adding `-ed` to the base verb.

---

`made`

### --feedback--

This is the `Simple Past` form of the irregular verb `make`, which does not follow the regular `-ed` pattern.

# --explanation--

You use the `Simple Past` tense in affirmative sentences when you want to talk about completed actions at a moment in the past. 

In the `Simple Past`, regular verbs like `check` are formed by adding `-ed` to the base verb. Irregular verbs, such as `make`, have unique forms that do not follow this rule. In James's sentence:

`Checked` is the past form of the regular verb `check`, indicating an action that was completed in the past. For example: 

`He checked his email before the meeting.` - He looked at the e-mails at a moment in the past prior to the meeting.

`Made` is the past form of the irregular verb `make`, indicating something that was created or done in the past. For example: 

`She made a list of items to buy.` - She created a list of what she wanted to buy before going to the store.
