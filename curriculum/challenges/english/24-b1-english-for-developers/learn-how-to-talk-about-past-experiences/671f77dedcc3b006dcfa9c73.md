`protecting`

### --feedback--

This word is the `-ing` form of a verb used after the preposition `about`, referring to the act of safeguarding something.

# --explanation--

The term `eye-opening` describes something that is enlightening or surprising, often revealing new or unexpected information. For example: 

`The workshop on cybersecurity was eye-opening for the team.` - this means the workshop brought many new ideas and it helped the team understand a lot of things about cybersecurity.

When a verb, like `to protect` follows a preposition, like `about`, it must be in the `-ing` form (gerund). This structure is common in English to describe actions connected to the preposition.  In the sentence, `about protecting` highlights the topic being discussed. For example: 

`She is interested in learning more about artificial intelligence.` - here, `in` is the preposition and `to learn` is the verb in the `-ing` form.
