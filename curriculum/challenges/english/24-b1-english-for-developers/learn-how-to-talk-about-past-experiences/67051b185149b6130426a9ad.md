# --explanation--

In the `Simple Past`, questions may start with a question word (e.g., `what`, `where`, `how`, `who`) using the following structure:

**Question word + `did` + subject + base verb.**

Lisa's question, `What did you find there?`, uses `what` to ask for specific information about the result of James's actions. Other examples include:

- `Where did you go yesterday?` - You are asking about a location.

- `How did they solve the problem?` - You are asking about a method.

- `Who did you call last night?` - You are asking about a person.

In the dialog, Lisa is asking about James's discovery while searching for the bug.
