# --explanation--

The expression `stuck on` is used when someone is unable to move forward with a task or solve a problem. It suggests being trapped or unable to progress. For example:

- `We were stuck on this code error for hours.` - We could not proceed until that error in the code was found.

- `She got stuck on the final question of the exam.` - She spent a long time on the final question.

In the dialogue, Lisa uses `stuck on` to describe how they were unable to make progress in solving a bug in their work.
