# --explanation--

In this sentence, `first` is used to show the initial action James took to debug the code. It indicates the start of a sequence of steps. Other examples of this usage include:

- `First, we need to set up the database.` - This means setting up the database is the initial step.

- `First, I turned on the computer.` - This means that before working on the computer, the initial thing I did was to turn it on.

The word `recent` refers to something that happened or was made not long ago. It describes changes to the code that were made shortly before the bug was discovered. Another example:

`The team discussed the most recent updates to the project.` - The updates that were talked about by the team were only the ones made in the last few days.
