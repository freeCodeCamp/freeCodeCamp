# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Hey, James. BLANK you BLANK that bug we were stuck on yesterday?`

## --blanks--

`Did`

### --feedback--

This word is used to form a question in the past tense. It's placed before the subject (`you`). Don't forget to capitalize it.

---

`find`

### --feedback--

This word means to locate or discover something, in its base form after `did` in questions.

# --explanation--

The `Simple Past` structure for forming questions starts with `did` + subject + base form of the verb. You use `did` to show the action happened in the past, but keep the main verb (e.g., `find`) in its base form. For example:

- `Did they finish the report on time?` - You want to know if the report was concluded before it was due.

- `Did she call you yesterday?` - You want to know if the person received a call the day before.

In Lisa's question, `did you find` is the question form to ask if James located or identified the `bug` they were working on the day before.
