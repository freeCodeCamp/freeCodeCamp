# --explanation--

`Logs` generally means records or reports that document events, actions, or data over time. `Logs` are often used in technical contexts to track system activity. For example: 

`The server logs showed multiple login attempts.` - There is a record in the server of attempts of logging into it.

`Error logs` specifically refer to records of system or application errors. These logs help identify issues by providing detailed information about what went wrong and when. For example: 

`The error logs revealed that the application crashed due to a missing file.` - In the record of issues or problems, you can see a missing file was the cause for the crash.

In James's sentence, he refers to checking the `error logs` carefully to identify the source of a problem. These logs are essential for troubleshooting in programming.
