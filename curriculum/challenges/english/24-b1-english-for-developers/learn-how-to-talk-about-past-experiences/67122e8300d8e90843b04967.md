# --explanation--

`Used to` refers to actions or situations that were habitual or true in the past but are no longer the case. For example: 

`We used to have weekly team meetings, but now we meet monthly.` - This means it was the team's habit to meet more frequently in the past - once a week instead of once a month, as they do now.

`Solely` means exclusively or only. It emphasizes that something was the only focus or priority. For example: 

`The company is solely focused on developing new technology.` - Meaning this is the **only** thing the company wants to concentrate its efforts on.

In this sentence, Linda explains that the team previously focused only on design and user experience, with no consideration for other aspects like security.
