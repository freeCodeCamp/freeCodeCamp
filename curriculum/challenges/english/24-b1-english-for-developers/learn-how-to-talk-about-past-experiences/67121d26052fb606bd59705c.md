# --explanation--

`Implications` refers to the possible results or effects of an action or decision, especially those that are not immediately obvious. In this context, `security implications` are the potential consequences of not considering security during updates. For example: 

`Before launching the new feature, the team discussed the implications for user privacy.` - Meaning they discussed the possible consequences to user privacy that this new feature could bring.

In Jake's question, he is referring to the potential negative outcomes of not considering security during past updates.
