# --explanation--

The word `stressful` describes situations or events that cause stress, tension, or anxiety. It is often used to talk about experiences that are challenging or demanding. For example:

- `The deadline was stressful because we had so much work to do.` - Meaning they felt a lot of stress due to the deadline.

- `Presenting to a large audience can be stressful.` - Meaning you can be feel really anxious when you present in front of an audience.

In this question, Lisa is asking James if fixing the issue with the app and the credentials was a stressful experience for him.
