# --explanation--

The term `postmortem` comes from Latin, meaning *after death*, but in a business context, it refers to a meeting or review conducted after the completion of a project to analyze its successes and problems. 

This meeting helps organizations learn from their experiences and improve future projects. For example:

`The team conducted a postmortem to discuss the challenges faced during the product launch.` - This means the team met after product launch to discuss the challenges they encountered in the process.
