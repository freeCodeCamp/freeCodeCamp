# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`We BLANK BLANK to integrate security and design as much as we should.`

## --blanks--

`didn't`

### --feedback--

This is the auxiliary verb of the simple tenses in the negative form. It shows that the action this was not a habit in the past.

---

`use`

### --feedback--

This is the base form of the verb used for past habits, not conjugated in its past form here, because the auxiliary verb `didn't` carries the past tense.

# --explanation--

In negative sentences with `used to`, the auxiliary verb `didn't` is used to indicate the past, and the main verb `use` remains in its base form (not conjugated). 

This structure emphasizes that an action was not habitual or common in the past. 

**Important:** The auxiliary verb `didn't` makes the sentence negative. The verb `use` stays in its base form because the past tense is already conveyed by `didn't`. For example: 

`We didn't use to have weekly meetings, but now we do.` - This means weekly meetings were not common back then. 

In Linda's sentence, she is saying that integrating security and design was not a regular practice in the past.
