# --explanation--

`Make` someone `think` means to prompt reflection or consideration about a particular topic or situation. It often refers to something that causes a person to evaluate or analyze an issue more deeply. For example: 

`The documentary made me think about how I can reduce my carbon footprint.` - This means that watching the documentary helped you think about how to pollute less.

In this context, the cybersecurity workshop prompted Brian to reflect on how they managed security in their projects in the past.
