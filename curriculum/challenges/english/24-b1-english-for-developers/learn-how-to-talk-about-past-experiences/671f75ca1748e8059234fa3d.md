# --explanation--

To `attend sessions` means to participate in organized events, such as talks, discussions, or meetings, often as an audience member. It typically refers to events at conferences, workshops, or professional gatherings. For example: 

`She attended several training sessions as part of her trainee program.` - Here, she took in a training because this is part of the trainee program.
