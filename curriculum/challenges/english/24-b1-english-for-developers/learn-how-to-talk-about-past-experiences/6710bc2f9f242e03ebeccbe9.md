<!-- (Audio) Linda: I was thinking we could do a quick postmortem of the design project. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Jake very briefly tell Linda that he agrees with the idea of having a quick `postmortem`?

## --answers--

`Oh, absolutely. I think doing a postmortem would be a great idea.`

### --feedback--

Even though this is correct, it is not brief. There's a simple, 4-letter word you can use to say exactly the same.

---

`Sure.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

When agreeing with someone's idea you can briefly tell a person that by saying `Sure`. For example:

- `Would you like to visit another country some day? Sure.` - This means you want to do it.

- `How about going to the movies this week? Sure.` - This means you accept the invitation.
