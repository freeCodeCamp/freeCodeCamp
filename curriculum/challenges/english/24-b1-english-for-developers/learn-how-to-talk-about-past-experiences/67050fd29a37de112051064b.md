# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Yes, I BLANK. It was quite a hunt.`

## --blanks--

`did`

### --feedback--

This word is used in short answers to confirm or emphasize an action in the past.

# --explanation--

Short answers in the `Simple Past` often use the auxiliary verb `did` to confirm or deny an action. This structure avoids repeating the full sentence while maintaining clarity. For example:

Question: `Did you finish the project?` 
Short answer: `Yes, I did.`

Question: `Did they call you back?`
Short answer: `No, they didn't.`

In the dialogue, James uses `Yes, I did` to confirm that he found the bug Lisa asked about.
