# --explanation--

The word `Absolutely` is used to express strong agreement or affirmation. It is often used in response to a statement or question to emphasize certainty or enthusiasm. For example: 

Person 1: `Do you think this approach will work?`

Person 2: `Absolutely!` - This means you are sure the approach will be successful. 

In this context, Brian could say `Absolutely` to enthusiastically confirm that he remembers getting excited about new technology at work.
