## --blanks--

`weren't`

### --feedback--

This is the negative form of the auxiliary verb `to be` in the `Past Continuous`, used for **plural** subjects.

---

`considering`

### --feedback--

This is the main verb in the `Past Continuous`. It has to do with thinking carefully about something.

# --explanation--

The `Past Continuous` in its negative form is used to describe actions that were not happening at a specific time in the past. The structure is:  
**`wasn't` / `weren't` + verb ending in `-ing`**. For example: 

- `He wasn't listening during the meeting.` - This sentence uses the singular form `was` 

- `They weren't following the instructions carefully.` - This sentence uses the plural form `were`.

In this context, `weren't considering` means that, at a certain point in the past, the team was not taking security implications into account while performing updates.  

The verb `consider` means to think carefully about something before making a decision or taking action. For example: 

`We need to consider all options before finalizing the project plan.` - Meaning it's necessary to think about the options.

In Jake's sentence, `considering` refers to the team evaluating or thinking about security implications.
