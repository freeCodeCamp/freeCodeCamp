# --instructions--

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK BLANK, I realized we didn't update the database credentials after the last security patch.`

## --blanks--

`After`

### --feedback--

---

`that`

### --feedback--

Demonstrative pronoun used when something is more distant from the speaker. When something is close to the speaker, you can use `this`.

# --explanation--

`After that` is used to show the order of events, meaning the next action or event followed something that happened previously. It helps organize actions in chronological order. For example:  

- `We finished the code review. After that, we started debugging.` - First, they reviewed the code. Then, they debugged it.

- `He submitted the report. After that, he took a short break.` - First, he submitted the report. Then, he rested.

`After that` is similar in meaning to expressions like `then` or `next`, but it specifically emphasizes that one action follows another in time. 

Here, James uses `after that` to indicate that realizing what the credentials issue was came after another action in the debugging process.
