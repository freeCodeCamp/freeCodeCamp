<!-- (Audio) James: The system wasn't connecting to the database properly. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`The system wasn't connecting to the database BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`properly`

### --feedback--

This word means in the correct or appropriate way.

# --explanation--

`Properly` is the adverb form of the adjective `proper`. Both words can express doing something in the correct or suitable manner, but their usage differs depending on the sentence structure. For example:  

- `The application didn't function properly after the update.` - This means the updates brought errors to the code. The adverb `properly` modifies the verb `function`.

- `This wasn't a proper configuration of the database.` - The adjective `proper` describes the noun `configuration`.

Here, James uses `properly` to describe that the system wasn't connecting to the database in the correct way.
