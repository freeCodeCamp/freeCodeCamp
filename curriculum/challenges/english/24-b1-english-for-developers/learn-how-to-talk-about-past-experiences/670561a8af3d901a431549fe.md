# --explanation--

`Successful` means achieving the desired result or goal. In this context, James says the connection was `successful`, meaning the database connection worked correctly after updating the credentials. For example:

- `The team completed a successful deployment yesterday.` - meaning the deployment finished with good results.

- `Her solution to the problem was successful and saved a lot of time.` - meaning she found a good solution to the problem.

In James's case, updating the credentials to make a successful connection to the database was necessary for the app to start working again.
