## --sentence--

`I did, but not always in BLANK BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`real`

### --feedback--

---

`time`

### --feedback--

This word refers to the ongoing or current moment in which events happen.

# --explanation--

The phrase `in real time` refers to something happening immediately as events occur, without delay. It is often used in the context of monitoring, communication, or data processing. For example: 

`The system updates the dashboard in real time, so you can see changes instantly.` - Meaning the dashboard changes immediately after the updates are applied.

In Jake's sentence, he means that while he checked for security vulnerabilities, it wasn't always done immediately as the updates happened.
