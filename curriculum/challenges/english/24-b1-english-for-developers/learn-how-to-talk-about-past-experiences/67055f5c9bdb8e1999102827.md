<!-- (Audio) James: I realized we didn't update the database credentials after the last security patch. Lisa: Ah, so the credentials were the issue. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

After these lines, Lisa then asks James if he solved the problem. How could she ask that **in a brief way**?

## --answers--

`Did you fix the credentials that were causing the issue?`

### --feedback--

That is indeed what she wants to know, but she asks a much shorter question than this one.

`Did you fix them?`

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

When talking about something you already mentioned before, you can use `it` to replace it if it is a singular noun or `them` if it is a plural noun to avoid repetition. For example:

- `You were looking for a car to buy. Did you buy it?` - `It` is used instead of `the car` in the question.

- `How were your tests last week? Did you do well on all of them?` - `Them` replaces `your tests` here.
