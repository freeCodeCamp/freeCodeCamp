# --explanation--

James uses the word `nothing`, which indicates the absence of any discovery. For example:

- `She found nothing unusual in the report.` -The report had the usual characteristics.

- `We saw nothing strange during the test.` - It was a pretty common test.

In contrast, in negative sentences, you'll use `anything` instead of `nothing`. For example:  

- Affirmative: `He found nothing.` - There were no discoveries.

- Negative: `He didn't find anything.` - There were no discoveries.  

Notice that, in negative sentences and in questions with `did`, the main verb (in this case, `find`) is in its base form. The auxiliary verb `did` is what shows that this sentence is in the past tense. For example:

- `They didn't find anything wrong with the program.` - Not finding anything was in the past.

- `I didn't see anything unusual during the presentation.` - Nothing unusual was seen in the presentation that happened in the past.

This structure helps avoid double negatives. James's answer, `Nothing at first`, reflects an affirmative sentence emphasizing that he couldn't find anything when he began his search.
