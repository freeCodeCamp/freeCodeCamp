# --explanation--

The phrase `so that` is used to express purpose or reason, showing why an action is done. For example: 

`She explained the process clearly so that everyone could understand it.` - This means her intent with explaining the process clearly was to make everyone understand it. 

In the dialog, Brian uses it to show that his goal in providing training is to empower others to perform at the same level as he did when he fine-tuned the code himself.
