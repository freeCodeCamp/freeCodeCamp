<!-- (Audio) Linda: We didn't use to integrate security and design as much as we should. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Jake tell Linda he agrees with what she is saying?

## --answers--

`Nonsense.`

### --feedback--

When you use `nonsense` to reply to a comment, it is because you do not believe it is true or deserves credit.

---

`Agreed.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`Agreed` is a concise way to express strong agreement with someone's statement. It is the opposite of the expression `Nonsense.` 

`Agreed` is often used in professional or conversational contexts to show alignment with what has been said. For Example: 

Person 1: `We should prioritize user feedback in our next update.`

Person 2: `Agreed.` - This answer implies you strongly agree with prioritizing used feedback on the next update.

In this context, Jake could use `Agreed` to acknowledge that he fully supports Linda's statement about the lack of integration between security and design in the past.
