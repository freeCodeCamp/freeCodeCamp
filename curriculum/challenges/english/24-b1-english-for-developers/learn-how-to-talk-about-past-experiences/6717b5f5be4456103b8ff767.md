# --explanation--

The `Present Continuous` tense is used here to describe two ongoing actions happening at the same time: `security checks are happening` and `design updates are being made`. This emphasizes simultaneous activities. For example:

`The team is testing the new feature while the developers are fixing bugs.` - This means the tests and the process of bug fixing are happening at the same time.

This tense is often used to indicate that two events are occurring at the same time, creating a sense of coordination or overlap in actions. In Jake's statement, he stresses the importance of ensuring that both actions occur simultaneously.
