The `Past Continuous` tense is used to describe actions or thoughts that were in progress at a specific time in the past. 

This tense is often used to describe background actions or ongoing processes in the past. The structure is **`was`/`were` + verb ending in `-ing`**.  

In this sentence, `I was thinking` shows that Linda's thought about doing a postmortem was in progress at a specific time. Another example:  

`He was reviewing the report when the meeting started.` - Meaning that the action of reviewing the report was in progress and another situation interrupted it.
