This word means strange or unusual.

# --explanation--

`Odd` is used to describe something that is unusual, strange, or unexpected. It often refers to something that does not fit the norm or is out of the ordinary. For example:

- `The system showed an odd behavior during the test.` - Meaning the system acted different from the normal.

- `I saw an odd pattern in the data.` - Meaning the pattern in the data was different.

In James's sentence, he uses `odd` to describe something he noticed that seemed strange or unexpected while reviewing the logs.
