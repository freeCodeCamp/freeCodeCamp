# --explanation--

`Issue` in this context means a problem or difficulty that needs to be solved. In the sentence, it refers to the database credentials being incorrect. For example:  

- `There was an issue with the system configuration.` - The problem was related to the configuration of the system.

- `The main issue was a missing file.` - The problem was caused by a file not being where it should be.

`Them` is a pronoun used to replace plural nouns already mentioned. In Lisa's question, `them` refers to the `credentials`. For example:

- `The files were corrupted. Did you fix them?` - `them` refers to the files.

- `The permissions were incorrect. I updated them this morning.` - `them` refers to the permissions.

Lisa's question asks if James fixed the credentials.
