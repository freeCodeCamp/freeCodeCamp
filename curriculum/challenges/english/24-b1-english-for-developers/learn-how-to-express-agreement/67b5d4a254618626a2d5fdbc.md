`Login` refers to the action of entering your username and password to access an account or system. It's commonly used in tech to describe the authentication process. For example:

`The login page asks for your username, password, and a security code.` - In this case, the `login` is the process of entering credentials to verify your identity and access an account.

`Lengthy` means something that is taking longer than usual or expected. For example:

`The lengthy installation process took more than an hour to complete.` - This means the installation took more time than expected, making it feel long.
