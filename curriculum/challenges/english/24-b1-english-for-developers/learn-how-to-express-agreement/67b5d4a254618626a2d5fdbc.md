# --explanation--

`Login` refers to the action of entering your username and password to access an account or system. For example:

`The login page asks for your username, password, and a security code.` - In this case, the `login` is the process of entering credentials to verify your identity and access an account.

`Length` refers to the measurement of something from end to end, usually in terms of distance or size. For example:  

`The length of the table is two meters.` – Here, `length` describes the physical measurement of the table.  

`Lengthy` means something that takes more time than usual or expected. It describes duration rather than physical size. For example:  

`The lengthy installation process took more than an hour to complete.` – This means the installation took longer than expected.
