`Reasonable` means fair, practical, or logical based on the context. It is used to ask if something makes sense or is acceptable. For example:  

- `The timeline for completing the project seems reasonable.` - This means the timeline is fair and achievable.  

- `Itâ€™s reasonable to expect a response within 24 hours.` - This means it is practical and fair to expect a reply within that time.

Using `reasonable` in conversation shows a polite and professional way **to confirm agreement** or check if a suggestion is acceptable.
