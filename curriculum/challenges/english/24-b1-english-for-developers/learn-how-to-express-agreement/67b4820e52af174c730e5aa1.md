<!-- SPEAKING -->

<!-- (audio) Jim: However, I've noticed that the app tends to lag a bit when switching between different sections. Could we work on that? -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Maria wants to show that she empathizes with Jim's concern. What should she say?

## --answers--

`I understand your point.`

---

`That's not a big deal.`

### --feedback--

This response dismisses Jim's concern. A better response would acknowledge the issue and express understanding, rather than minimizing it.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

When someone raises a concern, especially about something technical, the most appropriate response is to show that you understand and are ready to address it. 

Dismissing the issue with `That's not a big deal` is unhelpful and unprofessional.
