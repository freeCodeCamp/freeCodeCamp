A `sketch` is a rough drawing used to plan or visualize an idea. For example:

`She made a quick sketch of the website layout before designing it digitally.` – This means she created a simple drawing before starting the actual design.  

A `wireframe` is a simple outline or blueprint of a digital design, showing structure without details. For example:

`The team created wireframes to plan the website's navigation before adding colors and images.` – This means they first designed a basic structure before working on the visual details.
