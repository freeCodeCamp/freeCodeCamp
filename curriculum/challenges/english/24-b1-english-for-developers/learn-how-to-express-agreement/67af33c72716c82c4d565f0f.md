# --explanation--  

`Look forward to` is a phrasal verb that always needs to be followed by a **noun** or a **verb in its** `-ing` **form**. For example:  

- `I'm looking forward to meeting with the team tomorrow.` – Here, `meeting` is the `-ing` form of the verb, making the sentence correct.

- `We are looking forward to the event next week.` – In this case, `event` is a noun, which is also correct.  

Incorrect examples often use the base form of the verb instead of the `-ing` form. The correct answer follows this rule.
