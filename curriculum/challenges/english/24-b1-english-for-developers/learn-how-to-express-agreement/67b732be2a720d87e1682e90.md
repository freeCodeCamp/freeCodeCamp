After the conversation with Jim, Maria sent an email to the team:

`Hi team,`

`I wanted to share the recent feedback we received from Jim regarding the latest version of the app. Overall, he's happy with the user-friendly design and the navigation. However, he raised a few points for improvement: the lag when switching sections and the color scheme, which he feels could use a bit more energy. He also suggested that the login process could be improved, especially for returning users.`

`Here's what we'll focus on:`

`Fix the lag issue in the app – we're already working on this in the next update.`

`Adjust the color scheme by adding brighter tones for a feel of more energy – I'll discuss this with the design team.`

`Implement the "Remember Me" feature to speed up the login process, particularly for returning users – this will be prioritized for the next release.`

`Thanks for your hard work, and feel free to reach out if you have any more ideas.`

`Best,`

`Maria`
