`Implement` means to bring something into use, like a feature or plan. In tech, it's commonly used when you start using a new function or system. For example:

`We're planning to implement a new security measure next month.` - This means to start using or applying a new feature or system.

`Remember Me` is a feature used in websites and applications that allows users to stay logged in automatically for a period of time, without needing to re-enter their login details every time. For example:

`The "Remember Me" option saves your login information so you don't have to type it in again.` - This means `Remember Me` helps users by saving their login information, making the login process quicker.
