After the conversation with Linda, Bob sent an email to the team.

`Hi team,`

`I hope you're all doing well. Our first weekly meeting to review the mobile app project progress is scheduled for Friday morning at 9:00 AM. We'll go over the timeline, the prototype status, and the next steps for the design sketches and wireframes.`

`As we discussed, Linda will lead the UX design, and I'll be the one to coordinate with the developers. We'll also need to allocate tasks for the next phase, especially around the front-end design.`

`I'm excited to hear everyone's updates, and I'm confident these regular check-ins will help us stay focused and meet our deadlines. Looking forward to seeing you all!`

`Best,`

`Bob`
