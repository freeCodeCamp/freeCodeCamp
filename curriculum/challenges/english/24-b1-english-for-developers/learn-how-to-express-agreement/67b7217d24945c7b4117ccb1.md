`Prioritized` means making sure something is considered more important than other tasks. In a work context, it's often used when certain tasks need to be done first or urgently. For example:

`We need to ensure that the bug fix is prioritized for the next software update.` - This means the `bug fix` is considered urgent and needs to be handled before other tasks.

`Release` refers to the process of launching a new version of a product or software for public use. For example:

`The company will release the new feature next month.` - It indicates making the new feature available for users to use.
