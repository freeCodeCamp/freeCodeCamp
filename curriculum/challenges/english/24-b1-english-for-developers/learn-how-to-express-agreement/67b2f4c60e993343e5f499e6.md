## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

`Got it` is a casual, concise way to confirm understanding and agreement. In this context, it shows that you acknowledge Sarah's suggestion about improving the app's performance by speeding up the database queries.

`Thanks for the explanation` is more appropriate when you need clarification or when someone is explaining something new, but in this case, Sarah is making a suggestion, not explaining something in detail.
