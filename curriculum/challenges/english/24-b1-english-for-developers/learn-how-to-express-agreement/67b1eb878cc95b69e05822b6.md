`Catch` in this context means to discover or identify something, especially before it becomes too serious. For example:

`The manager was quick to catch the mistakes in the report.` - This means that the manager noticed the mistakes early before they could cause more issues.

`Catch problems` means to find problems or issues, often early enough to fix them before they get worse. For example:

`Testing the system helps to catch problems before they affect users.` - This means that the testing process allows them to discover problems before they cause harm to users or the system.
