# --explanation--

You use the `Second Conditional` structure (in Maria's speech, `It'd be helpful if we had...`) to describe a hypothetical situation. The structure of the second conditional is `It would` + base verb ... `if` + subject + verb in `Past Simple`. It is used to describe unreal or hypothetical situations in the present or future. For example:

`We would finish earlier if we had more team members.` - This means they don't have more team members, but if they did, they could finish earlier. We're talking about a hypothesis.
