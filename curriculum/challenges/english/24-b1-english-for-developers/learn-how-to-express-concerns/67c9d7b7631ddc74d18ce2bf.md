`They should just work harder.`

# --explanation--

`I see.` is used to briefly acknowledge that the speaker has understood what the other person is saying. It does not necessarily mean agreement, but it shows recognition of the information. For example:

`I see. So the project deadline has been moved up?` - This means the speaker understands what was said and is processing the information.
