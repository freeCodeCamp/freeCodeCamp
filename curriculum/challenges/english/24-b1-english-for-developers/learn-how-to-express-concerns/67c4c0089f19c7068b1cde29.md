<!-- (Audio) Bob: Wouldn't that make a difference? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Maria partially agree with Bob while expressing concern that this solution is not the best?  

## --answers--

`Yes, that would definitely work.`  

### --feedback--

Maria would be expressing full agreement with this sentence, which is not the case.

---

`It might, but it's not ideal.`  

## --video-solution--

2  

# --explanation--

Answers to questions with auxiliary or modal verbs do not always need to use the same verb. For example:

- Question: `Should we leave early?`

- Answer: `We could, but I'm not sure if it's necessary.` - The response uses `could` instead of repeating `should`.
