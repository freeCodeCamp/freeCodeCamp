# --explanation--

James uses the `Present Perfect` tense (`has been`) because he is describing an issue that started in the past and is still ongoing. If he had said `Communication was a challenge`, it would suggest that the problem is completely in the past. Compare the following sentences:

- `The new software has been difficult to use.` - It started being difficult in the past and it still is.

- `The new software was difficult to use.` - It was difficult before, but may not be anymore.
