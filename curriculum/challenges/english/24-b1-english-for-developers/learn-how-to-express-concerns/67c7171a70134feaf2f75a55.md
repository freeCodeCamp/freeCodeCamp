# --explanation--

In this sentence, Maria uses `they` to refer to the **members of the team**. Earlier in the conversation, she mentioned `the team` amd used a singular verb when she said `I need to understand how the team feels about the new project deadline`. Now, she refers to the people individually, so she switches to `they`. Another example:

- `The committee decides on the rules.` - Notice the usage of the verb in the singular to refer to the group as a whole. 

- `They discuss the rules before making a decision.` - There is a switch to emphasize the individuals in the group (the members of the committee), so the plural is used.
