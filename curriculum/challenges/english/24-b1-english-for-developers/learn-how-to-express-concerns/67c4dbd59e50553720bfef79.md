---  

`additional`  

### --feedback--

This word means extra or more of something.

# --explanation--

The question `Have you thought` uses the `Present Perfect` tense because it refers to an action that may have happened at any time before now and is still relevant. It differs from `Did you think`, as the latter would refer to a specific moment in the past. For example:  

- `Have you thought about learning a new language?` - This asks if the person has considered it at any time before now.

- `Did you think about learning Japanese while you were in Japan?` - This asks if the person wanted to take Japanese courses during the time they were in Japan (they are no longer there).

`Additional` means extra or more of something. For example:

`We need additional resources to complete the project on time.` - This means more resources are required.
