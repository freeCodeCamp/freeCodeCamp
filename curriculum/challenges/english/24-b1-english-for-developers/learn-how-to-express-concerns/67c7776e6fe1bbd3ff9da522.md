# --explanation--

`To be short on key roles` means not having enough people in essential positions, which makes work more difficult. For example:

`The restaurant is short on key roles, like waiters, so service is slower than usual.` - This means there are not enough waiters, which is an essential position for a restaurant, and this is affecting service.
