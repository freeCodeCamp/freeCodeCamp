<!-- (Audio) Bob: We might need to stick with what we have for now. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What could be a short way for Maria to acknowledge Bob's concern?  

## --answers--

`That's not true.`

### --feedback--

This disagrees with Bob instead of acknowledging his concern.  

---

`Understood.`

## --video-solution--

2  

# --explanation--

You could say `Understood.` to mean that you acknowledge another person's point without adding further argument or discussion. It is a brief way to show you have heard and processed what the other person said. For example:

- **Manager:** `We need everyone to submit their reports by Friday.` - This means the manager is expressing it is necessary that the reports are delivered by the end of the week.

- **Employee:** `Understood.` - This means the employee acknowledges the instruction.
