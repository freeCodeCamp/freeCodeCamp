1  

# --explanation--

`May` and `might` are used to express probability, meaning something is possible but not certain. `May` suggests a likely probability, whereas `might` suggests a lower probability or more uncertainty. In practical terms, however, you could use one or another to express that there is a chance that something will happen. For example:

- `We may finish the project early if we stay on schedule.` - This means there is a possibility of finishing earlier - as long as they stay on schedule.

- `He might come to the meeting, but he's not sure yet.` - This means there's a possibility that he'll get to the meeting, but he'll have to make an effort or check if he will be able to do it.
