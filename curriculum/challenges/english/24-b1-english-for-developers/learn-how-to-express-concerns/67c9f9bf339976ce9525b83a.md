# --explanation--

The `First Conditional` structure (`If + Present Simple`) is used here in combination with the verb `could`, which is used instead of `will` to indicate that the consequence is possible but not certain. Another example:

`If we skip the meeting, we could miss important updates.` - This means missing updates is a possible consequence, but not guaranteed. If you wanted to imply a more guaranteed outcome, you'd use `will` instead of `could`.
