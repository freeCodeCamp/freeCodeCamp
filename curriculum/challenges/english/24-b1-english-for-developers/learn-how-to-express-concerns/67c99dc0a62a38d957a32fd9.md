After talking to James, Maria has come up with a list of important points so that she could discuss them with Bob in an upcoming meeting. This is the list:

`Meeting Notes: Talk with James`

`Key Points:`

- `Project Deadline: The team is already working extra hours, and the new deadline is adding more stress.`

- `Burnout Risk: More pressure could lead to burnout. We should rethink task priorities to ease the workload.`

- `Resource Shortage: The team is missing key roles, making it harder to manage tasks efficiently.`

- `Communication Issues: Late updates are causing problems. More regular check-ins could help.`

- `Team Morale: Constant pressure is affecting motivation. We need ways to support the team.`

`Suggested Actions:`

- `Ask Bob again about getting extra support.`
