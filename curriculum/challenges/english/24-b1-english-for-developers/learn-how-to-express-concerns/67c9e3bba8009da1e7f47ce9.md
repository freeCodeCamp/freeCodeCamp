# --explanation--

Maria uses **reported speech** after `they said` to share what the team previously stated. In reported speech, verbs often shift to a past form, but `Present Continuous` (`are putting`) remains continuous (`they're already putting in extra hours`). For example:

- Direct speech: `"We are working late," they said.`  

- Reported speech: `They said they were working late.`

Here's another example:

- Direct speech: `"I have finished the report," she said.`

- Reported speech: `She said she had finished the report.`
