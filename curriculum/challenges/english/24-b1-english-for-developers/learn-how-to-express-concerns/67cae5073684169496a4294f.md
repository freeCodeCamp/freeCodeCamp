# --explanation--

`Which` is used to introduce a part of the sentence that adds **extra** information about the previous statement.

In this sentence,`which makes it hard to meet the new deadline` gives an additional detail about the fact that the team does not have enough resources. Another example:

`We had a long meeting, which delayed the project.` - The part after `which` only explains the consequence of the long meeting. It does not add crucial information to understand the previous statement.
