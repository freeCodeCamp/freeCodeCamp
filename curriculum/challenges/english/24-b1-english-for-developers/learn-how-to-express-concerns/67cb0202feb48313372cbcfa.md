---

`Let me think about it.`

### --feedback--

## --video-solution--

1  

# --explanation--

`I can do that.` in this context does not express **possibility** but rather **willingness or agreement** to complete the task. You can use it to confirm that you will do what another person asks. For example:

- Person 1: `Could you send the report by tomorrow?` - This person is asking for a report to be handed in on the following day.

- Person 2: `Sure. I can do that.` - This means the speaker agrees to do it, not just that they are capable of doing it.
