# --explanation--

`Let me know`, preceeded by a conditional sentence, like `If you need anything`, is a common way to offer help. It makes the offer open-ended, meaning the person can ask for help if they find it necessary. For example:

`If you have any questions, just let me know.` - This means you are available to answer questions when needed.
