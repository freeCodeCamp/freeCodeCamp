# --explanation--

When using the verb `suggest`, use the following verb in the `-ing` form instead of the infinitive. For example:

- `She suggested taking a break.` - This means the idea proposed is to take a break.

- `He suggested starting the meeting earlier to avoid delays.` - This means he proposed beginning the meeting sooner.
