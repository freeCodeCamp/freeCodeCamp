# --explanation--

`Really` and `too` are both **intensifiers**, but they have different meanings. `Really` strengthens the adjective it modifies without indicating excess. `Too`, on the other hand, indicates excess, meaning more than what is acceptable or manageable. For example:

- `The project is really important.` - This means that the project is very important, but not necessarily too much.
 
- `This task is too complicated.` - This means that it is more complicated than it should be.
