# --explanation--

`Quite` is an **intensifier** that means rather or very, depending on context. It is used to emphasize the adjective that follows it. For example:

- `The task is quite difficult.` - This means it is rather or very difficult, depending on emphasis.

- `She was quite tired after the long day.` - This means she was very tired, but not completely exhausted.
