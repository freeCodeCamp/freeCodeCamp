`differently`  

### --feedback--

This is an adverb that means something can be done in another way.

# --explanation--

`To be better` suggests that something different could be an improvement. For example:

`Wouldn't it be better to start earlier and avoid last-minute stress?` - This means starting earlier might be an improvement.

`Differently` means in a different way. It describes **how** something is done. This contrasts with `different`, which is used to describe how things, people or situations are. Other examples:

- `We need a different plan.` - Here, `different` describes the plan.  

- `We need to plan differently.` - Here, the description is about how to plan something in another way.
