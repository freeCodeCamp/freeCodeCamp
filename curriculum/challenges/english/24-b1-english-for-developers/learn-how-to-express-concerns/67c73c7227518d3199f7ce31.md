# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense (`have/has been` + verb in `-ing` form) is used to describe an action that started in the past and is still happening or has recent effects. For example:

`She has been studying for hours, and she's getting tired.` - This means she started studying in the past and is still studying now, with visible effects.

When James says `We've already been putting in extra hours`, he means that the team started working extra hours some time ago and is still doing it now. Another example:

`She has been studying for hours, and she's getting tired.` - This means she started studying in the past and is still studying now, with visible effects.
