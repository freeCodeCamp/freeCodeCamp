## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

`That's a good idea` is a natural way to respond to a `Have you thought about...` question. It acknowledges the suggestion and shows that the speaker recognizes it as a helpful idea. For example:

- Person 1: `Have you thought about using a different strategy?` - This person is suggesting a different approach to a problem.

- Person 2: `That's a good idea! We should try it.` - This person acknowledges the suggestion and wants to do what the other person told them to do.
