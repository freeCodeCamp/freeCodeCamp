# --explanation--

When reporting a question - in other words, when telling another person about a question that was made to you - you can use `if` to introduce an indirect speech. This is common when turning `yes/no` questions into statements.

For instance, if your mother asks `Can you pass me the salt?` to another person in the family at lunch time, and you notice that person did not hear, you could probably tell this other person `Mom asked if you can pass her the salt.`

Notice the change from the interrogative to the affirmative form and the change from `pass me the salt` to `pass her the salt`, since you are reporting what another person said. Another example:

- Original question: `Does the team have enough time to complete the task?`

- Reported question: `She asked me if the team has enough time to complete the task.`
