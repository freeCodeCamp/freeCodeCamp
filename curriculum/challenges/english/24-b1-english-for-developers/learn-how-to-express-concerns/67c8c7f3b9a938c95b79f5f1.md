# --explanation--

James uses the `Second Conditional` structure (`It'd be great if we had...`) to talk about a hypothetical situation.

The structure of the `Second Conditional` is: `It would` + base verb... `if` + subject + verb in the `Simple Past`. It is used to describe unreal or hypothetical situations in the present or future. For example:

`We would finish earlier if we had more team members.` - This means they don't have more team members, but if they did, they could finish earlier.
