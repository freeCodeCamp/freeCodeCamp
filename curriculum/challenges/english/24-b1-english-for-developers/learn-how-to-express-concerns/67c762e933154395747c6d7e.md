`Hands on deck` means that more people are needed to help with a task or situation. It comes from sailing, where all crew members were needed on the ship's deck to handle an urgent situation. For example:

`We have a tight deadline, so we need all hands on deck.` - This means everyone must help to complete the work on time.
