<!-- (Audio) Maria: I need to understand how the team feels about the new project deadline. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.  

# --questions--

## --text--

How can James agree with discussing the topic with Maria and ask what Bob said?  

## --answers--

`Sure, Maria. What did he say about it?`  

---

`Yes, but let's discuss it later.`

### --feedback--

This delays the conversation instead of agreeing and asking for details.  

## --video-solution--

1  

# --explanation--

James's question uses the `Simple Past` tense (in this case, `did he say`) because Maria's conversation with Bob is already finished. The `Simple Past` is used to ask about completed actions. Other examples:

- `What did she decide after the meeting?` - The question is about a meeting that is over.

- `Where did they go for lunch?` - The action of going somewhere has already happened. Lunchtime is finished.
