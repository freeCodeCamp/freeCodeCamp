# --explanation--

`Team` refers to multiple people, it is a singular noun. Even though there are some exceptions to this rule, collective nouns, like `team`, `company`, or `group` take a singular verb, so we use `feels` instead of `feel`. Other examples:

- `The company values its employees.` - Notice the singular verb `values` is used because `company` is a singular noun.

- `The group decides where to meet.` - Notice the singular verb `decides` is used because `group` is a singular noun.
