# --explanation--

`How` is used to ask about the way or method to do something. When `how` follows another question phrase (like, in this case, `Did they say`), the rest of the sentence follows an affirmative structure (`we could fix it`) instead of the question word order. For example:

- `Did she explain how we can improve communication?` - This is correct; what comes after `how` follows an affirmative structure. It would be incorrect to use `Did she explain how can we improve communication?` here.

- `Can you show me how I should submit the report?` - What comes after `how` (`I should submit the report`) follows an affirmative structure (`I should` instead of `should I`).
