## --sentence--

`Bob: Hey, Maria. Can we talk about the BLANK? The client is asking if we can finish a week earlier. What do you think?`

`Maria: A week earlier? That's quite a BLANK, Bob. The team is already working hard.`

`Bob: I know. But I'm wondering if there's anything we could do to speed things up. Maybe move some tasks around or prioritize the most important ones?`

`Maria: That might help, but we need to be careful not to BLANK the team. They're already putting in extra hours. Besides, rearranging tasks doesn't always solve the problem.`

`Bob: True, but we could try working even more extra hours, just for this project. Wouldn't that make a difference?`

`Maria: It might, but it's not ideal. We should consider the BLANK impact on the team's morale and productivity. Have you thought about getting additional support?`

`Bob: That's a good idea, but I'm not sure we have the budget for that. We might need to BLANK what we have for now.`

`Maria: Understood. In that case, let's at least prioritize the tasks. If we can focus on the critical parts of the project, we might still meet the deadline without BLANK everyone.`

`Bob: That sounds like a plan. Could you BLANK a new schedule based on this idea? Also, could you check with the team to see what they need to make things work more smoothly?`

`Maria: Sure, I'll work on it today and send you the new schedule by tomorrow. I'll also ask the team if they have any suggestions or need additional resources.`

`Bob: Great, thanks. I appreciate it, Maria. If you need anything from me, just let me know.`
