# --explanation--

Even though Bob's sentence does not use a direct grammatical structure for making a suggestion, the way he phrases the question implies one. `Maybe` at the start of the question introduces possible actions, which can be interpreted as suggestions. For example:

`Maybe we could try a different approach.` - This is not a direct suggestion, but it implies an idea for consideration - trying a different approach.
