# --explanation--

`To let someone know` means to inform someone about something. For example:

`I'll let you know when the report is ready.` - This means the person will provide an update when the report is finished.

`To update someone` means to provide new or important information. For example:

`Can you update me on the status of the project?` - This means the speaker is asking for the latest information about the project.
