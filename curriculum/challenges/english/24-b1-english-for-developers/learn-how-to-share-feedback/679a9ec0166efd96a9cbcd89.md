# --explanation--

The structure `it's + adjective + to` is used to describe the nature of an action. For example:

`It's necessary to prepare before an important presentation.` - This means that preparing is an essential action before presenting.

In this sentence, `it's healthy to have` means that having disagreement is beneficial.
