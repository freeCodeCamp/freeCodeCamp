# --explanation--

The `First Conditional` is used to talk about real or possible situations in the future and their likely results. It follows the structure `if` + `Present Simple` tense for the condition, and `will` or `can` + base verb for the result. For example:

- `If you study hard, you will pass the exam.` - This describes a possible situation and its result.  

- `If it rains tomorrow, we can cancel the picnic.` - This explains what might happen if a condition (rain) occurs.
