## --sentence--

`Brian: Hi Lisa, what did you think about the recent team meeting? Some people seemed to have BLANK about our approach to the project.`

`Lisa: I noticed that too. If everyone has a different opinion, it could be difficult to BLANK.`

`Brian: Yes, but I think it's BLANK to have some BLANK. If we all agreed on everything, we might miss important details, don't you think?`

`Lisa: I understand, but sometimes too much disagreement can slow things down. If we want to meet our BLANK, we need to work together.`

`Brian: True, but if we ignore different BLANK, we could end up with a less effective solution.`

`Lisa: I guess you're right. I just feel that if we focus too much on BLANK, we won't have enough time to get the actual work done.`

`Brian: Perhaps, but it's also important to make sure everyone feels heard. If people don't feel valued, they might BLANK, right?`

`Lisa: That's a good point. Maybe we can find a balance between listening to feedback and BLANK.`
