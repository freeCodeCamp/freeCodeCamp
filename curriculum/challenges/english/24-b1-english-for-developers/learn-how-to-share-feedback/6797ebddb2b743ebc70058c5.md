# --explanation--

`Talk to you soon` is commonly used to end a conversation while expressing an expectation of speaking again in the near future. For example:

`I'll send you the details later. Talk to you soon!` - This indicates that the person plans to follow up or continue communication shortly.

It is a polite and friendly way to say goodbye temporarily, often used in both personal and professional contexts.
