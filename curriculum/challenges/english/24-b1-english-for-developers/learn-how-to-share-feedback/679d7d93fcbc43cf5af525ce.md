# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect` (`I've investigated`) is used after `once` to show that the action must be fully completed before the next step happens. This emphasizes completion of the task rather than the moment in time when it happens. For example:

`Once I've reviewed the document, I'll share my feedback.` - This means the feedback will be given only after the review is finished.
