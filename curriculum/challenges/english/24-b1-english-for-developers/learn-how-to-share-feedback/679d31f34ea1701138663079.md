# --explanation--

`Other` before `projects` is used to refer to additional or different projects besides the one being discussed. It contrasts with `another`, which refers to just one more. For example:

- `We need to complete other tasks before moving on.` - You are referring to multiple tasks.

- `We need to complete another task before moving on.` - You are referring to a single additional task.
