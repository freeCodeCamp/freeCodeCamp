# --explanation--

`To ensure` means to make certain that something happens or is achieved. For example:

`We must ensure that all safety regulations are followed.` - This means to make sure that the regulations are adhered to.

`To be on track` means to be progressing as planned or expected. For example:

`The project is on track to be completed by the deadline.` - This means the project is progressing as expected and will likely be finished on time.

In this context, Bob wants to confirm that Jessica is meeting her objectives.
