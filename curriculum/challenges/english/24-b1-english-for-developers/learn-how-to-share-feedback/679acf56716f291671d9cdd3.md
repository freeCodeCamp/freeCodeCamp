# --explanation--

`Too much + noun` is used to indicate an excessive amount of something, which is often seen as negative. For example:

`Too much noise in the office makes it hard to concentrate.` - This means an excessive amount of noise negatively affects concentration.

In this dialogue, `too much disagreement` means an excessive level of disagreement that could slow progress.
