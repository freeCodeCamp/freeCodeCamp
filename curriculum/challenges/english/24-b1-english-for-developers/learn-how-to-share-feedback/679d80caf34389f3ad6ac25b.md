# --explanation--

The phrase `let's hope` is used to express a shared desire or wish for a positive outcome. It encourages optimism or patience. In this case, James is suggesting that he and Maria both hope for an easy solution. For example:

`Let's hope the weather stays nice for the trip.` - This means you wish to have good weather during the trip and suggest that the listener do the same.
