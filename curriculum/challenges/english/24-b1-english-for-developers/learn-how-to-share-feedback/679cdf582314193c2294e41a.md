# --explanation--

`He's not happy with` means that a person is dissatisfied. It is a softer way of expressing discontent. For example:

`She's not happy with the way the project was handled.` - This means she is dissatisfied, but not necessarily angry.

`I'm not sure why` expresses uncertainty about the reason for something. For example:

`The system stopped working, and I'm not sure why.` - This means the speaker does not know the cause of the issue.
