# --explanation--

`Something` can be used in questions when the speaker assumes that a thing exists.

In `Is it something serious?`, James assumes there is an issue - because Maria told him the client complained about it - and asks if it is serious. By contrast, `anything` is used in questions when the speaker does not know if something even exists. For example:

- `Is there something wrong with the software?` - Here, the speaker assumes there is an issue and asks for confirmation about what it is.

- `Is there anything wrong with the software?` - Here, the speaker is just curious if there is any problem. They are not looking for confirmation.
