# --explanation--

`To point out` means to highlight or draw attention to something. In this case, the client `pointed out` issues with the search function and buttons. Another example:

`She pointed out that the report had incorrect data.` - This means she highlighted an error in the report.

`To respond` means to react or function as expected. If buttons aren't responding, it means they are not working when clicked. For example:

`My phone isn't responding when I tap the screen.` - This means the screen is not reacting to touch.
