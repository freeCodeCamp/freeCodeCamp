# --explanation--

The verbs `guess` and `feel` are used to express opinions in a less definite way.

In these cases, the `Present Simple` tense is used instead of the `Present Continuous` tense because `guess` and `feel` are stative verbs, which describe states of mind rather than actions. That's why we say `I guess` and `I feel`, not `I'm guessing` or `I'm feeling` when expressing opinions.

`To guess` means to assume or conclude something without being completely certain, whereas `to feel` expresses personal opinions or emotions. For example:

- `I guess he'll be late because of traffic.` - This means the speaker assumes he will be late but is not sure.  

- `I feel that this decision is the best for the team.` - This means the speaker believes this is the right choice.
