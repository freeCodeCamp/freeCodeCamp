## --blanks--

`agreed`

---

`might`

### --feedback--

This word is used to express a possibility or something that could happen.

# --explanation--

T`To agree` means to share the same opinion or to be in harmony with someone else's view. For example:

`We all agree that teamwork is essential for success.` - This means everyone shares the same opinion about the importance of teamwork.

`Might` in a conditional sentence expresses possibility, similar to `could`. For example:

`If you left earlier, you might arrive on time.` - This means there is a possibility of arriving on time if the person leaves earlier.

In this dialogue, `we might miss important details` suggests that if everyone agreed, there is a chance they would overlook key information.
