`However` is a transition word used at the beginning of a sentence to introduce a contrasting idea. For example:

`The task seemed easy. However, it turned out to be quite challenging.` - Here, `however` contrasts the initial expectation with the reality.

`Documentation` refers to written or digital records that explain or detail a specific process, product, or system. For example:

`The team updated the project documentation to include the new features.` - In this case, `documentation` refers to records about the project.

In this context, Bob first praises Jessica's work. Then, he contrasts the initial praise with a point for improvement.
