# --explanation--

`To ignore` in this context means to overlook or not consider something. For example:

`If you ignore customer feedback, you might lose business.` - This means that failing to consider customer opinions could have negative consequences.

`To end up with something` means to eventually arrive at a certain result or outcome, often unexpectedly. For example:

`If you don't plan well, you could end up with a rushed project.` - This means that poor planning could lead to a last-minute, unorganized result.
