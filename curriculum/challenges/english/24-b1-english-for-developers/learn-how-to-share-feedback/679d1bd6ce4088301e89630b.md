# --explanation--

A `coding issue` refers to a problem in the software code that causes errors or unexpected behavior. These issues can include bugs, logic errors, missing functionality, or performance problems. For example:

`The team is investigating a coding issue that prevents users from logging in.` - This means a problem in the code is causing login failures.
