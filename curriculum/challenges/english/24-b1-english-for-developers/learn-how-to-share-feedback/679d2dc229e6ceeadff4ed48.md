# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Do you think we need to update the software again? If we BLANK, it might BLANK other projects.`

## --blanks--

`do`

### --feedback--

This word is used to avoid repeating the verb `update` from the previous sentence.

---

`delay`

### --feedback--

This word means to postpone or make something happen later than planned.

# --explanation--

Instead of saying `If we update the software, it might delay other projects.`, James shortens it to `If we do`. The word `do` is often used to avoid repeating the verb or a complete phrase used in from the previous sentence. For example:

`She wants to join the meeting, and if she does, she'll need the link.` - Instead of saying `if she joins the meeting`, you can use `does` to replace it and this way you can avoid the repetition.

`To delay` means to make something happen later than planned. For example:

`The flight was delayed due to bad weather.` - This means the flight was postponed and did not leave on time.
