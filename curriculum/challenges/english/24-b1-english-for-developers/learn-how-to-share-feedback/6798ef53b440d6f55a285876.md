# --explanation--

`I noticed that` is used to introduce an observation or something you have become aware of. For example:

`I noticed that the presentation was much clearer after the revisions.` - This means the speaker observed that the presentation improved.  

In this context, Lisa could use this phrase to agree with Brian's observation about people having strong opinions on the project approach.
