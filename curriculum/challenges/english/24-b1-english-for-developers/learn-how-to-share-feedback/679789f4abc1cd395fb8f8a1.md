# --explanation--

The phrase `making changes` means modifying or improving something to make it better or more effective. In this context, Jessica is likely referring to improving the documentation. For example:

`The company is making changes to its policies to improve employee satisfaction.` - This means the company is adjusting its policies to achieve better outcomes.
