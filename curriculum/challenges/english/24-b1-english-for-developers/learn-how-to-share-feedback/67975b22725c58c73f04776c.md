# --explanation--

`What do you think?` is used in this context to invite someone's opinion or feedback about a specific statement or idea. It encourages engagement and collaboration. For example:  

`I think we should launch the product next month. What do you think?` - This invites others to share their perspective on the suggested timeline.  

This phrase is often used in conversations to keep discussions open-ended and interactive.
