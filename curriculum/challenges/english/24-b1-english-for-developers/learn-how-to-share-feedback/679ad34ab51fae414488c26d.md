# --questions--

## --text--

How could Brian agree with Lisa by saying that her argument seems valid?

## --answers--

`That's not what I'm talking about.`

### --feedback--

Using this sentence, Brian would be dismissing Lisa's argument as off-topic.

---

`True.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Lisa's sentence expresses a general fact about teamwork and deadlines. If Brian agrees with her idea and thinks it's true, he could simply say `True.` to agree with what she says. Another example:

- Person 1: `If you exercise regularly, you stay healthy.`

- Person 2: `True.` - This means that you agree with what the speaker said about exercising.
