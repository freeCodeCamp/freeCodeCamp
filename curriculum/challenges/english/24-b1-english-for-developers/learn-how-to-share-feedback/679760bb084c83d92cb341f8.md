# --explanation--

`Sounds good` is used to express approval or agreement with what someone else has said or suggested. For example:  

- `We'll meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow.` `Sounds good.` - This shows the speaker agrees with the proposed time.

`Will` is often used to make a promise to someone else. For example:

- `I will call you tomorrow to update you on the project.` - This shows a promise to contact someone.

- `Don't worry, I will handle the presentation for the meeting.` - This shows a promise to take responsibility for something.

In this case, Jessica uses the contraction for `I will`, `I'll work on it`, to promise that she will improve the documentation.
