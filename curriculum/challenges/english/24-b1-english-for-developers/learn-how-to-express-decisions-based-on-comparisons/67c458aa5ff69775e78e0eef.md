`Can you help me decide which one is BLANK for security?`

## --blanks--

`better`

### --feedback--

This word is the comparative form of `good` and is used when comparing two options. It shows that one is superior in quality or performance.

# --explanation--

`Better` is the comparative form of `good` used when comparing two things. It's often used with `than`, to connect two options.

In comparative form, adjectives with one syllable usually add `-er` (like `faster` and `stronger`). Longer adjectives use `more` (like `more efficient` and `more interesting`). Some adjectives have irregular comparative form, like `good` changes to `better`. For example:

`Cloud storage is better than local storage for remote access.` â€“ This means cloud storage supports remote access, while local storage lacks or is not good in this capability.
