# --explanation--  

Sarah suggests a balanced approach by `building the core components in-house` to maintain control while `outsourcing the less critical parts` to speed up development.

This strategy allows the team to keep oversight of the most important aspects while benefiting from the efficiency of outsourcing for less essential tasks.
