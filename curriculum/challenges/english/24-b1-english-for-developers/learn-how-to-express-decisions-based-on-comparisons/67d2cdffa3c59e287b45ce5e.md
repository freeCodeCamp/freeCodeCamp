# --explanation--

Tom says `they offer the most flexible hours and the most generous leave policy`, which means the company allows employees to have more control over their work schedule and provides better time-off benefits than other companies.  

A company with `flexible hours` lets employees choose when to start and finish work. A `generous leave policy` means employees get more vacation or sick days than usual.
