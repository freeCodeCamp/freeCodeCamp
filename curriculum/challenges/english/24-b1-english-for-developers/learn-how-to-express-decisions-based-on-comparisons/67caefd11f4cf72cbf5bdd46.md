<!-- (audio) Jake: Not really. SafeGuard is more focused on security, so it might not integrate as easily with other platforms. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK. SafeGuard is more focused on security, so it might not integrate as easily with other platforms.`

## --blanks--

`Not really`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase is a casual way of saying "no" or "not exactly". It's often used when you want to politely disagree or give a softer, less direct response. The first letter of the first word is capitalized.

# --explanation--

`Not really` is commonly used to give a negative answer, but in a softer tone. It's more casual than simply saying `No`. For example:

Person 1: `Do you think this software is user-friendly?`

Person 2: `Not really.`

This means it's not very user-friendly, but the speaker might not be completely certain.
