# --explanation--

Tom says `InnovateX has the best bonuses and stock options, which can be even more lucrative in the long run.` This means that although TechCorp may offer higher salaries, InnovateX provides financial benefits that can be more profitable over time. 

`Bonuses` are extra payments, and `stock options` allow employees to own shares in the company, which can increase in value.
