`user-friendly`

### --feedback--

This means easy to use or simple to navigate. This is a compound word. Remember to use `-`.

# --explanation--

`More user-friendly` means that something is easier to use compared to another option. `More` is used in this comparative form because `user-friendly` is a longer adjective. For example:

`This new app is more user-friendly than the old one because it has a simpler design.` - This means the new app is easier to use than the previous one.
