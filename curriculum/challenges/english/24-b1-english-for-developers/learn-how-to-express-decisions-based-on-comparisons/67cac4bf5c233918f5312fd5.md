This two-word phrase compares the flexibility of two things.

# --explanation--

`As flexible` means that you're comparing the flexibility of two things to see if they are equal in this regard. For example:  

`This jacket is as flexible as the one I bought last week.` - In this case, you are comparing how adaptable both jackets are, saying they have the same level of flexibility.
