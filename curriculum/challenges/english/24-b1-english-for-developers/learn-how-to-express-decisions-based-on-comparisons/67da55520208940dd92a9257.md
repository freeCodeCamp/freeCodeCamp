# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Outsourcing is usually faster because the external team can BLANK BLANK BLANK our project.`

## --blanks--

`focus`

### --feedback--

This means to give full attention to something.  

---

`solely`

### --feedback--

This means only or exclusively, without distractions.  

---

`on`

### --feedback--

This preposition is used to indicate the specific subject receiving attention.  

# --explanation--

`Focus on` means to give full attention to a specific task or subject.

`Solely` means only or exclusively, without any other responsibilities or distractions.

When people say `focus solely on`, they are combining both ideas: giving full attention *only* to one specific thing. 

Notice that `solely` is placed between `focus` and `on` to emphasize that there are no other distractions. For example:

`He needs a quiet space to focus solely on writing his code.` â€“ This means he wants to give all of his attention to coding, without any interruptions.
