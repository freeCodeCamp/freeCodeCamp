# --instructions--

This task doesn't have audio. Read the question below and select the correct answer.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence correctly uses the comparative form?

## --answers--

`This task is more easy than the previous one.`  

### --feedback--

The word `more` is unnecessary because `easy` changes to `easier` in the comparative form.

---

`This code runs more faster than before.` 

### --feedback--

`More faster` is incorrect because `faster` is already a comparative form.

---

`This algorithm is more efficient than the old one.` 

---

`The new update is gooder than the last one.`

### --feedback--

`Gooder` is incorrect. The correct comparative form of `good` is `better`.

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

To form the comparative degree, add `-er` to the end of adjectives or adverbs with one syllable, while for longer ones, add `more` at the beginning.

`More efficient` is correct because `efficient` is a longer adjective.

You may notice that each option contains the magical word `than`. It is a conjunction used for comparisons. It typically follows adjectives or adverbs in the comparative form and introduces the second element in a comparison, showing a difference in degree, amount, or preference.
