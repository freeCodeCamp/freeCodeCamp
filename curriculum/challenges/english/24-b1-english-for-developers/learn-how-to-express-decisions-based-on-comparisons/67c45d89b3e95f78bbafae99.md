# --explanation--

To form the comparative degree, add `-er` to the end of adjectives or adverbs with one syllable, while for longer ones, add `more` at the beginning.

`More efficient` is correct because `efficient` is a longer adjective.

You may notice that each option contains the magical word `than`. It is a conjunction used for comparisons. It typically follows adjectives or adverbs in the comparative form and introduces the second element in a comparison, showing a difference in degree, amount, or preference.
