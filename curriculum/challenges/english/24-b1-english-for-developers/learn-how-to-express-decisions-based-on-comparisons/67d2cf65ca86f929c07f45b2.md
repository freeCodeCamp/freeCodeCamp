<!-- SPEAKING -->

<!-- (Audio) Tom: Well, Alice, it depends on what you're looking for. In terms of work-life balance, TechCorp is probably the best. They offer the most flexible hours and the most generous leave policy. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.  

# --questions--

## --text--

How might Alice respond to Tom's opinion?  

## --answers--

`That's interesting.` 

---

`I don't like working overtime.`  

### --feedback--

Tom is talking about work-life balance and flexible hours, not overtime.  

## --video-solution--

1  

# --explanation--

A natural response to someone sharing their opinion is to show interest or curiosity. `That's interesting` is a neutral and polite way to acknowledge what Tom said.  

`I don't like working overtime` does not fit because Tom does not mention working overtime, only flexibility and leave policies.
