## --video-solution--

3  

# --explanation--

A superlative compares three or more things to show the highest or lowest degree.  

Add `-est` to short adjectives (like `fastest`), and use `most` with longer adjectives (like `most efficient`). Some adjectives have irregular forms (like `best`). Be sure to use `the` before superlatives.
