# --explanation--

`Review the quote` shows she plans to carefully check the details before making any decisions.

`Touch base` means she will reconnect with Josh after reviewing it, likely to discuss any questions, confirm changes, or approve the next steps.

This shows a clear, organized process rather than rushing, canceling, or ignoring the quote.
