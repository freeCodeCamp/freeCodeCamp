# --explanation--

Jake says the integration is `seamless` and that it's a good choice for `startups with limited IT resources`.

`Seamless` means smooth and easy, and `limited IT resources` means the startup doesn't have much technical help.

So, GuardianTech is a good option because it's simple to set up and doesn't require a big IT team.
