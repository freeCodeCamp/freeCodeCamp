After their meeting, Josh followed up by sending Sarah an email with the updated quote based on everything they discussed:

`Hi Sarah,`

`Thank you again for meeting with me today. Based on our discussion, I've drafted a new quote for the components needed for the next product batch.`

`Here's a quick overview:`

`Resistors: We have selected the high-capacity ones from the catalog you preferred. We will prepare a sample for you before making the full order.`

`Cables: I've updated the order to request longer lengths, about double the size we used last time.`

`Connectors: We've included the highest quality options, as discussed, to ensure the best performance for the new design.`

`Attached, you'll find the updated list of items. I have checked our stock levels, and most of these items are ready to go. For those that are not immediately available, I've noted the expected arrival times.`

`Please review the quote when you have a moment. Let's touch base after you've had a chance to look it over.`

`Thanks again, and I look forward to your feedback!`

`Best regards,`

`Josh`

To find the correct answer, focus on the topics Josh covers in his email.

Josh discusses stock, cables, and connectors but never mentions shipping costs.

Look for the option that talks about something missing from the email content.
