`These are the ones we selected for the project.` – This points to specific selected items.

`Even better` means something is an improvement compared to another good option. For example:

`We thought the laptop was good, but we found something even better with more power.` – This shows finding a stronger or more advanced option.

`Catalog` is a collection or organized list of products, usually in a document, online system, or printed book. For example:

`We checked the supplier's catalog for new network cables.` – This means reviewing a list of available items to choose from.
