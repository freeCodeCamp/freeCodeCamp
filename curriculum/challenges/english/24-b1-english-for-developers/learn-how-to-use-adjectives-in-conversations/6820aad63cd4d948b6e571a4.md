`Slow down` means to reduce speed, especially in speaking, so listeners can understand better. For example:

`You should slow down during the important parts of the presentation.` – This means speaking more clearly and calmly.

`Get to` means to reach a specific part of a message or task. For example:

`When you get to the main point, make sure to pause.` – This means wait or focus when arriving at that part.

`Sink in` means to gradually become clear or understood. For example:

`It took a moment for the idea to sink in.` – This means someone needed time to fully understand the idea.
