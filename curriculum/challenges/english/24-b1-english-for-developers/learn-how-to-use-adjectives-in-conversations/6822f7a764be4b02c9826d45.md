# --explanation--

James says the new version `not only looks better, but also works better` and that `it’s faster and responds quicker`. This means he is commenting on both the appearance and performance of the software.

`Faster` and `quicker` show improved speed, while `looks better` and `works better` show improvements in design and functionality.
