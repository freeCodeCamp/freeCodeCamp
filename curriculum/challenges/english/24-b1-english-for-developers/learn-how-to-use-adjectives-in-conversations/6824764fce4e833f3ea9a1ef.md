---

It can only support a small number of users at once.

# --explanation--

James explains that the system is designed to manage increased demand by handling more users and actions `at once`. He also says they’ve ensured it can grow smoothly `as more users join`, which shows it remains efficient even with a rising number of users.

This means the system can scale without losing performance.
