<!-- SPEAKING -->

<!-- (Audio) James: Yes, Jessica. I agree. The new version not only looks better, but also works better. It's faster and responds quicker when we do things on it. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What would Jessica most likely say after hearing James's opinion?

## --answers--

`That's good to hear.`

---

`We should go back to the old version.`

### --feedback--

James just said the new version is better and faster, so it wouldn't make sense to go back.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

James gives positive feedback about the new version, saying it looks and works better and is faster.

A natural response from Jessica would be something supportive, like `That's good to hear`.

Suggesting they go back to the old version would contradict what James just said.
