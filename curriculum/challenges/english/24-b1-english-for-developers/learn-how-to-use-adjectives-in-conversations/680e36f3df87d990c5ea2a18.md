After their meeting, Josh followed up by sending Sarah an email with the updated quote based on everything they discussed:

`Hi Sarah,`

`Thank you again for meeting with me today. Based on our discussion, I’ve drafted a new quote for the components needed for the next product batch.`

`Here’s a quick overview:`

`Resistors: We have selected the high-capacity ones from the catalog you preferred. We will prepare a sample for you before making the full order.`

`Cables: I’ve updated the order to request longer lengths, about double the size we used last time.`

`Connectors: We’ve included the highest quality options, as discussed, to ensure the best performance for the new design.`

`Attached, you’ll find the updated list of items. I have checked our stock levels, and most of these items are ready to go. For those that are not immediately available, I’ve noted the expected arrival times.`

`Please review the quote when you have a moment. Let’s touch base after you’ve had a chance to look it over.`

`Thanks again, and I look forward to your feedback!`

`Best regards,`

`Josh`

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on what Josh says about the resistors.

The email mentions that they selected high-capacity resistors from the catalog Sarah preferred.

Josh also says they will prepare a sample, which shows the resistors are included and important.

Look for the option that matches selecting and preparing resistors, not removing them.
