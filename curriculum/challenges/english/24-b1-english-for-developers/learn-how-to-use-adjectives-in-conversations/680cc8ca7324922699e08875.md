`Sample` means a small piece or amount of a product used to test or evaluate it before buying more. For example:

`The team requested a sample of the new memory chips before approving the full order.` – They wanted to check the quality first.

`Make a large order` means to place a big purchase request for many items. For example:

`We will make a large order of hard drives for the new server installation.` – This means buying a big quantity at once for a tech project.
