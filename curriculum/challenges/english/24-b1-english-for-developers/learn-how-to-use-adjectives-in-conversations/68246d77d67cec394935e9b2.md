# --explanation--

Jessica brings up a final question by saying `Lastly`, showing she's wrapping up the discussion.

By saying `handle more users than the old one`, she wants to know if the updated version can manage more users compared to the previous one.

Her focus is on whether the new version performs well under more user activity. Not on design, features, or speed of updates.
