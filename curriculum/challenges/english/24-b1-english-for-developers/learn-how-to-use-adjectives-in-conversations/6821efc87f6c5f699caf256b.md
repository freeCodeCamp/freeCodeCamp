# --explanation--

`Compare` means to look at things side by side and check their similarities or differences. `Versions` refers to different forms or releases of a software product.

So, Jessica is asking James to examine two different releases of the software.

She does not mention anything about budgets, writing new code, or fixing a database issue.
