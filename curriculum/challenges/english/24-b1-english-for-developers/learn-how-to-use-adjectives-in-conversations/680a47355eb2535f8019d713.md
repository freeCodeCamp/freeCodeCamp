# --explanation--

`Wrap up` means to finish or complete something. Sarah says they need to `wrap up the list of components`, which means they want to complete the list before they move forward.

`Components` are the parts needed for the `product batch`, a group of products being made.

The goal of the meeting is to finish that list of `components`.
