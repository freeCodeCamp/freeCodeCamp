## --sentence--

`Let's start with BLANK. The new one seems easier to use and cleaner than the old one.`

## --blanks--

`how they look`

### --feedback--

These three words mean the appearance or design of something.

# --explanation--

`How they look` is a clause that starts with `how`, which introduces a topic or subject. For example:

`He didn't like how the icons looked on the screen.` – This means he didn't like the appearance of the icons.

Clauses like `how they look` are called noun clauses, and they can act as the object of a sentence.

In this context, `Let's start with how they look` means the first thing to examine is the way the two versions appear visually.
