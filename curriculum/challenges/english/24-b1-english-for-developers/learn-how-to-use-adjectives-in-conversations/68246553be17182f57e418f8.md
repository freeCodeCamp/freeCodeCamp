`Have` is used as a helping verb in the `Present Perfect` tense to ask about past actions connected to the present. For example:  

`Have you tested the new version?` – This asks if something happened before now.

`Reported` means someone told or gave information about something, especially problems or results. For example:  

`Users reported an issue with the login page.` – They informed someone about it.

`Fewer` is a comparative word used with countable nouns to mean a smaller number. For example:  

`There were fewer errors in the latest release.` – The number of errors is smaller compared to before.
