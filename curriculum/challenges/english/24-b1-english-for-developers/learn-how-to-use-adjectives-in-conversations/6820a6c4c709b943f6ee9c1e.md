# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`As your startup grows, GuardianTech scales effortlessly to meet increasing demands, ensuring a BLANK, BLANK digital environment.`

## --blanks--

`secure`

### --feedback--

This adjective means protected from danger, risk, or unauthorized access.

---

`sustainable`

### --feedback--

This adjective means being able to continue over time without causing harm or running out of resources.

# --explanation--

`Secure` means safe and protected, especially from digital threats or data breaches. For example:

`The company uses secure systems to protect customer data.` – This means their systems are designed to keep information safe.

`Sustainable` means something that can last or continue long-term without negative impact. For example:

`We aim to build a sustainable business model.` – This means a plan that can work well over time.

The order `secure, sustainable` is important because security is a basic requirement before something can be maintained long-term. A digital environment must first be protected (`secure`) before it can reliably continue to grow or operate over time (`sustainable`).

Switching the order could suggest focusing on long-term growth before ensuring safety, which is less logical in most tech or business contexts.
