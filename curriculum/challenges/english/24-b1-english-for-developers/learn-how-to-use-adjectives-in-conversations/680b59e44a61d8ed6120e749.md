Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What might Josh say if he wants to show a helpful attitude?

## --answers--

`I didn't know we had a meeting today.`

### --feedback--

This sounds confused, not helpful. Sarah already started the meeting.

`No problem at all.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

When Josh wants to show a helpful or cooperative attitude, a polite reply like `No problem at all` is a good choice. It shows he is happy to be there and ready to help.

The other option doesn't fit the tone of the meeting.
