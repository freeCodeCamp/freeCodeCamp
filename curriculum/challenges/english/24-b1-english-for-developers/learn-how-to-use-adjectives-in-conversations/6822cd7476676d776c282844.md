---

`cleaner`

### --feedback--

This is the comparative form of `clean`. It means more organized or less messy.

# --explanation--

`Seems` means that something appears to be a certain way, based on what someone notices. For example:

`The new dashboard seems faster than the old one.` – It appears to perform better, but this is based on observation, not proof.

`Easier` is the comparative form of `easy`. It's used to show that one thing is simpler to do or understand than another. For example:

`This API is easier to integrate with.` – It takes less effort to connect it to other software.

`Cleaner` is the comparative form of `clean`. In tech, it often means a design or layout has fewer distractions or is more organized. For example:

`The updated website has a cleaner layout.` – It looks more organized and easier to navigate.

Here, all three words help compare the new version of the software to the old version, focusing on how it appears and how users experience it.
