`A stable app doesn't freeze or close by itself.` – It keeps running properly.

`Work without` is a common phrase that means something functions while avoiding a problem or need. For example:

`The tool works without an internet connection.` – It still functions even when offline.

`Crashing` is when software or a system suddenly stops working. For example:

`The browser keeps crashing when I open too many tabs.` – It shuts down unexpectedly.
