## --blanks--

`personal life`

### --feedback--  

These two words together refer to a person's activities, relationships, and responsibilities outside of work. The first word describes who it belongs to, and the second word is a noun.

# --explanation--

Anna explains that asynchronous remote work helps people manage their `productivity` (how efficiently they work) and their `personal life` (their time outside of work).

This flexibility allows employees to work when they are most focused and balance work with personal responsibilities, like family or hobbies.
