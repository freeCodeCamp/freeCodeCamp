# --explanation--

`That makes sense` is a natural way to show agreement. People use this phrase in conversations when they accept or understand a suggestion. For example:

- Person 1: `We should optimize the code before adding new features to avoid performance issues.`

- Person 2: `That makes sense. A slow app will frustrate users.` - This person agrees and understands why optimizing the code first is a good idea.
