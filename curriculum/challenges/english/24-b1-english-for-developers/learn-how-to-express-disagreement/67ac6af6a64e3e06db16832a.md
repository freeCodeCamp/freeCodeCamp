# --explanation--

`Makeshift` means temporary or not ideal, and `setup` refers to an arrangement of equipment or furniture. Together, `makeshift setup` describes an improvised work environment that may not be comfortable or efficient. For example:

- `My laptop broke, so I used an old PC as a makeshift setup.` - The speaker used an old computer as a temporary replacement.

- `The team worked from home with makeshift setups during the office renovation.` - Employees used temporary workstations at home while the office was being fixed.
