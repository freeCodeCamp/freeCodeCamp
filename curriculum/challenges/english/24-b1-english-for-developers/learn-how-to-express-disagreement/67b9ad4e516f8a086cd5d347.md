# --explanation--

`I understand, but` is a polite way to acknowledge someone's point while introducing a concern or a different opinion. This phrase helps keep discussions respectful and balanced. For example:

- Person 1: `We should release the update today.`

- Person 2: `I understand, but have we tested it enough?` - This person acknowledges the idea but questions if it's ready.
