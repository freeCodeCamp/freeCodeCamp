# --explanation--

`That's a valid point` is a polite way to acknowledge someone's argument. It means that their concern is reasonable and worth considering. For example:

- Person 1: `Too many meetings can reduce productivity.`

- Person 2: `That's a valid point. We should keep them short and focused.` - This person agrees that unnecessary meetings waste time.

Anna would use this phrase to show that she understands and agrees with David's concern about potential delays and miscommunication in asynchronous remote work.
