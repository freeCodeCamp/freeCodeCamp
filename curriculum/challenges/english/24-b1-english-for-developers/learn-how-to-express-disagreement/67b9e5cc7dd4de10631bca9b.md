<!-- (Audio) David: I understand. But isn't it challenging to manage communication and collaboration with everyone working at different times? It seems like it could lead to a lot of delays and miscommunication. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What would Anna say if she wanted to show agreement with David?

## --answers--

`That's a valid point.`

---

`That's not true at all.`

### --feedback--

This response does not show agreement.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`That's a valid point` is a polite way to acknowledge someone's argument. It means that their concern is reasonable and worth considering. For example:

- Person 1: `Too many meetings can reduce productivity.`

- Person 2: `That's a valid point. We should keep them short and focused.` - This person agrees that unnecessary meetings waste time.

Anna would use this phrase to show that she understands and agrees with David's concern about potential delays and miscommunication in asynchronous remote work.
