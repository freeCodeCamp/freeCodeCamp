# --explanation--

`Communication` refers to the exchange of information between people. It includes emails, messages, video calls, and discussions that help people share ideas and stay informed. For example:

`Clear communication is key when working on remote teams.` - Team members need to express their ideas well to avoid misunderstandings.

`Collaboration` means working together to achieve a common goal. It involves teamwork, problem-solving, and sharing ideas to complete a project successfully. For example:

`Collaboration between cybersecurity experts and developers improves software security.` - Security experts and developers must work together to prevent vulnerabilities.
