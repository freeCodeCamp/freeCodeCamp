# --questions--

# --explanation--

`I see your perspective, but` is a polite way to acknowledge someone's viewpoint before introducing a contrasting opinion. This phrase helps keep discussions respectful and open. For example:

- Person 1: `We should use a new programming language for this project.`

- Person 2: `I see your perspective, but switching languages might slow us down.` - This person understands the idea but points out a possible drawback.
