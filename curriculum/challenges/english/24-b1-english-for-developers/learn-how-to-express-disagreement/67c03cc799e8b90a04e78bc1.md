# --explanation--

`I see your point, but` is a way to acknowledge someone's concern while giving a different opinion. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's add more features to the app.`

- Person 2: `I see your point, but too many features might make it confusing.` - This person understands but is worried about making the app harder to use.
