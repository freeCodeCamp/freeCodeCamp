# --instructions--

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I understand, but isn't office furniture also a priority? BLANK, a lot of people are working from home with makeshift setups.`

## --blanks--

`I mean`

### --feedback--

This phrase is used to clarify or support an idea. The first letter is capitalized.

# --explanation--

`I mean` helps provide additional reasoning or clarification for the previous statement. For example:

- `The app is slow. I mean, it takes forever to load!` - The speaker clarifies how slow the app is by giving an example.

- `I think we need more tests. I mean, we keep finding bugs after release.` - They clarify that testing is necessary because bugs appear too often.

Bob uses `I mean` to explain or strengthen his argument. He just mentioned office furniture as a priority and then supports this idea by explaining that many people are working from home with temporary setups.
