# --explanation--

`Complicate` means to make something more difficult or confusing. `Budget` refers to the plan for managing money.

Together, `complicate the budget` means to make the financial planning more difficult. For example:

- `If we buy all new office furniture at once, it might complicate the budget for next month.` - Spending too much at one time could make it harder to control expenses.

- `Expanding the project could complicate the budget because we would need more money.` - Making the project bigger might increase costs and make budgeting harder.
