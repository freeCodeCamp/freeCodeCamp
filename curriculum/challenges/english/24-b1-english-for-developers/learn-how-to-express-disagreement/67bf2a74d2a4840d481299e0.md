<!-- (Audio) Bob: Anna, do you remember our last discussion about the remote work stipend? Iâ€™ve talked again with the team and we still have the same issue: some people think it should be used for technology, while others suggest office furniture. Do you have any ideas on how to solve this? -->

# --explanation--

`How about` is used to suggest an idea or alternative. For example:

- Person 1: `The project deadline is approaching quickly.`

- Person 2: `How about we work in smaller groups to speed things up?` - This person is suggesting breaking into smaller teams to get more work done faster.
