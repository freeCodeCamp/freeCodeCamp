# --explanation--

`Asynchronous work` means that employees do not have to work at the same time. They can complete tasks at different hours based on their schedules. For example:

`Asynchronous work allows remote teams to collaborate across different time zones.` - Teams can work at different times without needing to be online together.

`Flexibility` means that employees have more control over when they work, making it easier to balance personal and professional responsibilities. For example:

`Remote work offers flexibility in managing your schedule.` - Employees can choose when to work instead of following strict office hours.
