<!-- (Audio) David: I see your perspective, but I still think there's value in having everyone in the office. It builds team spirit and makes problem-solving easier. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Anna agrees with David while having her own point. What should she say?

## --answers--

`True, but the office isn't the only place to build team spirit.`

---

`You're right, so there's no need for remote work at all.`

### --feedback--

Anna still supports remote work and wants to show that team spirit can be built in other ways, not just in the office.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`True, but` is a way to show agreement while adding a different perspective. This phrase helps keep discussions open and balanced. For example:

- Person 1: `AI can automate a lot of tasks in software development.`

- Person 2: `True, but human oversight is still necessary to catch errors AI might miss.` - This person agrees that AI helps, but reminds that humans are still needed.
