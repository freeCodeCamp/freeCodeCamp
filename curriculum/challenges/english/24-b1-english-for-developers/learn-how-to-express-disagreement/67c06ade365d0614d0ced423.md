# --explanation--

`Personal preferences` refers to choices based on individual likes, needs, or priorities. For example:

- `Some team members prefer working in the morning, while others have different personal preferences.` - People have different times of day when they like to work.

- `When it comes to software, personal preferences play a big role in choosing between Windows or Mac.` - People often choose an operating system based on their own likes or habits.
