After talking with Anna, David decided to try virtual team-building activities. Here's his email to the team:

`Subject: Strengthening Our Remote Team with Virtual Activities`

`Hi Team,`

`After thinking about ways to improve our remote work experience, I've decided to introduce virtual team-building activities. Remote work offers great flexibility, allowing us to work in ways that suit our productivity and personal lives. However, it also comes with challenges like communication gaps and a lack of team connection.`

`To help with this, we'll be trying out some virtual activities to strengthen collaboration and maintain team spirit. These activities will give us a chance to connect outside of work tasks and build a stronger sense of teamwork.`

`While remote work can sometimes feel isolating, the right tools and efforts can make a big difference. Let's give this a shot and see how it improves our work experience! More details to come soon.`

`Looking forward to your thoughts!`

`Best,`

`David`
