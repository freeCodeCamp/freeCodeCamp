# --explanation--

`Minimum requirement` refers to the basic standard that must be met. For example:

- `The minimum requirement for passing the test is getting at least 50% of the answers correct.` - You need to score at least 50% to pass.

- `To apply for this job, you need to meet the minimum requirement of 2 years of experience.` - There is a basic condition, like 2 years of experience, that must be met to apply.
