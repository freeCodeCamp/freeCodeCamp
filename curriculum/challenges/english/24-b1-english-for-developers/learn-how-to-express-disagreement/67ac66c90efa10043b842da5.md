# --explanation--

`I understand, butâ€¦` is a polite way to show partial disagreement. This phrase acknowledges the other person's point before introducing a different perspective. For example:

- `I understand, but we don't have enough time to implement this feature.` - The speaker agrees but points out a time constraint.

- `I understand, but the current design is more user-friendly.` - The speaker sees the other perspective but believes the current design is better.
