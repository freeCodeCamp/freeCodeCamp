`Collaboration tools` is a software that helps remote teams stay connected. For example:

- `Collaboration tools like Google Drive make it easy to share and edit files in real time.` - Google Drive allows multiple users to work on documents at the same time.

- `Using the right collaboration tools improves team productivity and efficiency.` - The right software helps teams work faster and more effectively.

These tools include software like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Zoom, which help teams communicate and work together effectively, even when working asynchronously.
