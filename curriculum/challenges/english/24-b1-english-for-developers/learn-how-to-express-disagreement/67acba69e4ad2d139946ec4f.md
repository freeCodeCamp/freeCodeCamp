# --explanation--

`I agree, butâ€¦` is a polite way to show partial agreement while adding a different perspective. This phrase is useful in discussions where you want to recognize the other person's argument while bringing up another important factor. For example:

- Person 1: `Working remotely is more flexible.`

- Person 2: `I agree, but it can also make team communication harder.` - This person agrees about the flexibility of remote work but mentions a potential downside.
