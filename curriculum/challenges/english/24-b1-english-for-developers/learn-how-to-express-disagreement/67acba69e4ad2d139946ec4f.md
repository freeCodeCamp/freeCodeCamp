<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Anna doesn't fully agree with Bob. What should she say?

## --answers--

`That's true, and there's nothing else to consider.`

### --feedback--

Anna wants to introduce another point about technology, so she wouldn't say there's nothing else to consider.

---

`I agree that comfort is important, but we shouldn't neglect technology.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`I agree, butâ€¦` is a polite way to show partial agreement while adding a different perspective. This phrase is useful in discussions where you want to recognize the other person's argument while bringing up another important factor. For example:

- Person 1: `Working remotely is more flexible.`

- Person 2: `I agree, but it can also make team communication harder.` - This person agrees about the flexibility of remote work but mentions a potential downside.
