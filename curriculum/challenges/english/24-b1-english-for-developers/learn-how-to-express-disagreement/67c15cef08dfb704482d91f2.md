## --sentence--

`Bob: Anna, do you remember our last discussion about the remote work stipend? I've talked again with the team and we still have the same issue: some people think it should be used for technology, while others suggest BLANK. Do you have any ideas on how to solve this?`

`Anna: How about we BLANK the stipend into two parts? That way, people can use part of it for technology upgrades and part for office furniture or other home office needs.`

`Bob: That's a good idea, but wouldn't it complicate the BLANK? It might be easier to BLANK one category.`

`Anna: I see your point, but flexibility might be better. Think about it. Wouldn't it be simpler to let people decide how to use their stipend based on their individual needs?`

`Bob: Maybe, but we also need to ensure everyone has the basic equipment to work remotely. What if we set a BLANK, and anything beyond that can be used for BLANK?`

`Anna: That could work. If we create a list of essential items, like a BLANK, webcam, and headset, then anything extra could be allocated as they wish.`

`Bob: That's a reasonable suggestion. If we do that, people will have the essentials while still having some freedom to choose.`
