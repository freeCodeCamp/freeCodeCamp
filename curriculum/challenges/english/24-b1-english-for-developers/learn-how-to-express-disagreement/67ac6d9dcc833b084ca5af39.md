# --explanation--

A `desk` is a table used for working, and a `chair` is a seat with a backrest. For example:

- `I bought a new desk and chair for my home office.` - The speaker got new furniture to improve their workspace.

- `The company provided employees with a desk and chair for remote work.` - The employer gave workers furniture to use while working from home.

In a work environment, having a good desk and chair can help with posture and productivity, reducing discomfort and fatigue.
