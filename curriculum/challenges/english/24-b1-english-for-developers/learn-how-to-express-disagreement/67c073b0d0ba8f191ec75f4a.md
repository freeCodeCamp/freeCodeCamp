# --explanation--

`Allocated` means to set aside or assign something for a specific purpose. For example:

- `The manager has allocated a budget for the new project.` - The manager has set aside money for the project.

- `The company has allocated extra time to train new employees.` - The company has set aside time for training.

In this dialogue, Anna suggests that after purchasing essential items, employees can use the extra funds however they choose.
