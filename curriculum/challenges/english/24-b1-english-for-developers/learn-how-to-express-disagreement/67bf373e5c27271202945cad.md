# --explanation--

`That's a good idea, but` is a way to agree with someone while introducing a concern. For example:

- Person 1: `We could hold a meeting to discuss the new project.`

- Person 2: `That's a good idea, but maybe we should first gather all the necessary information.` - This person acknowledges the suggestion but believes gathering more information is a better first step.

Bob acknowledges Anna's suggestion before raising a concern about the budget.
