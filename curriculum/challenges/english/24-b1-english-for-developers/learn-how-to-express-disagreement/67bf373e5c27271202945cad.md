<!-- (audio) Anna: How about we split the stipend into two parts? That way, people can use part of it for technology upgrades and part for office furniture or other home office needs. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Bob likes the idea but has a concern. What would he say?

## --answers--

`That's a good idea, but wouldn't it complicate the budget?`

---

`That's not necessary. Let's just keep the stipend the same.`

### --feedback--

This does not acknowledge Anna's idea before raising a concern.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`That's a good idea, but` is a way to agree with someone while introducing a concern. For example:

- Person 1: `We could hold a meeting to discuss the new project.`

- Person 2: `That's a good idea, but maybe we should first gather all the necessary information.` - This person acknowledges the suggestion but believes gathering more information is a better first step.

Bob acknowledges Anna's suggestion before raising a concern about the budget.
