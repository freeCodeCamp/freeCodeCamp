<!-- SPEAKING -->

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`Not necessarily` is a polite way to express partial disagreement. Instead of directly saying `no`, it suggests that there might be other factors to consider. In conversations, this phrase helps keep discussions open and respectful. For example:

- Person 1: `I think upgrading the computer's processor will fix the issue.`

- Person 2: `Not necessarily. The problem could be with the software, not the hardware.` - This person is suggesting that upgrading the processor might not solve the problem because it could be caused by something else, like outdated software.
