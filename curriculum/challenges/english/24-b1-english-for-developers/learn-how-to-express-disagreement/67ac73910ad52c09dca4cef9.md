<!-- (Audio) Bob: I understand, but isn't office furniture also a priority? I mean, a lot of people are working from home with makeshift setups. A comfortable desk and a chair can make a big difference. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Anna doesn't completely agree with Bob. What should she say?

## --answers--

`That's true, and I have no other opinion.`

### --feedback--

Anna has a different view, so she wouldn't say she has no opinion.

---

`Not necessarily.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`Not necessarily` is a polite way to express partial disagreement. Instead of directly saying `no`, it suggests that there might be other factors to consider. In conversations, this phrase helps keep discussions open and respectful. For example:

- Person 1: `I think upgrading the computer's processor will fix the issue.`

- Person 2: `Not necessarily. The problem could be with the software, not the hardware.` - This person is suggesting that upgrading the processor might not solve the problem because it could be caused by something else, like outdated software.
