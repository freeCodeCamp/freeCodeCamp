# --explanation--

`True, but…` allows to agree with someone while adding a different point of view. This phrase is useful in discussions where you want to recognize a valid point while presenting your own argument. For example:

- Person 1: `AI tools can speed up coding.`

- Person 2: `True, but they still make mistakes that need human review.` - This person agrees that AI helps with coding but points out that it's not perfect and still requires human oversight.
