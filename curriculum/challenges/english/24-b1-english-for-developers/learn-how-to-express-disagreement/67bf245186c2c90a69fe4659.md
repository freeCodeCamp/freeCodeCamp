# --explanation--

`Same` means unchanged or identical. For example:

- `We have the same task to complete this week.` - This means that the task is identical for everyone.

- `They have the same opinion about the new software update.` - This means that both people agree on the update.

Bob says, `we still have the same issue`, which means the problem has not changed.
