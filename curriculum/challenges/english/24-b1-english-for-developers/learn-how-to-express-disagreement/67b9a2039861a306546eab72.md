`Productivity` describes how well someone can complete tasks. For example:

`Using automation tools can boost productivity by reducing manual work.` - Automation helps complete tasks faster, increasing efficiency.

`Personal life` refers to non-work responsibilities and activities. For example:

`Remote work helps employees balance their job and personal life.` - Working from home makes it easier to manage work and personal time.
