# --explanation--

`Do you remember` is used to check if someone recalls past information. For example:

- `Do you remember where we saved that file?` - You're asking someone if they recall the location of the file.

- `Do you remember when the issue first occurred?` - You're asking someone if they recall the time the issue started.
