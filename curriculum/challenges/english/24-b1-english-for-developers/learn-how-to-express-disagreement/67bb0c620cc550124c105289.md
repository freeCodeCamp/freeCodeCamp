`Do our best` means to put in the most effort possible, even when resources or conditions are not ideal. For example:

- Person 1: `I'm not sure if we can handle this issue on our own.`

- Person 2: `We'll do our best, and if we need help, we'll ask for it.` - This person suggests trying their best and seeking help if needed, showing confidence.

Anna is saying that, despite challenges, they must work with what they have and make the most of it.
