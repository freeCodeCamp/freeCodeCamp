# --explanation--

The phrase `just as important` is used to compare two things and emphasize that they have equal importance. It suggests that neither one is more significant than the other. For example:  

- `Exercise is just as important as eating healthy.` – This means both exercise and a healthy diet contribute equally to good health.  

- `Team communication is just as important as individual skills.` – This means both factors are equally necessary for success.

Anna is not disagreeing with Bob but adding to his point. By saying `having the latest technology can be just as important,` she means that technology is equally important as office furniture when considering productivity. This phrase helps balance two ideas without saying that one is better than the other.
