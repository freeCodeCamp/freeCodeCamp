# --explanation--

If someone is asking for your opinion and you disagree, you should respond politely and clearly. For example:

- `I don't think so.` - A simple and direct way to disagree.

- `I'm not sure about that.` - A softer way to express doubt.

- `I don't really agree.` - A polite way to disagree without being too strong.
