# --explanation--

Bob asks, `Do you think that's a good idea?` This is a way to ask for someone's opinion about a suggestion or plan. Here's other ways to ask for an opinion:

- `Do you think this will work?`

- `What's your opinion on this?`

- `How do you feel about this plan?`

In this dialogue, Bob is referring to employees using the remote work stipend for office furniture. Instead of stating his own opinion, he is asking Anna what she thinks.
