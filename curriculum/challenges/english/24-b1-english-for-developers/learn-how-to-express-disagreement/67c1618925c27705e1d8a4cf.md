Since the remote work stipend was updated, Anna decided to email the team with updates:

`Subject: Update on Remote Work Stipend – What's Covered`

`Hi team,`

`We've reviewed feedback on how to best use the remote work stipend, and we've decided to offer more flexibility while ensuring everyone has the essentials for remote work.`

`The stipend will now cover two categories:`

`1. Essential Equipment – This includes a laptop, webcam, and headset to ensure everyone has the necessary tools to work efficiently.`
 
`2. Personal Workspace – Any remaining funds can be used for office furniture or additional tech upgrades based on individual needs.`

`This way, everyone has the basics covered while still having the freedom to improve their home office setup in the way that works best for them.`

`If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!`

`Best,`

`Anna`
