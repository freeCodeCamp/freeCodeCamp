# --explanation--

`Remote work` means working from a location outside of a traditional office, such as from home, a co-working space, or another place with internet access.

A `stipend` is a fixed amount of money given to cover certain expenses. Unlike a salary, a `stipend` is usually meant for specific costs, such as education, travel, or work-related expenses.

A `remote work stipend` is a financial benefit given to employees to help cover expenses related to working from home. This can include internet costs, office supplies, furniture, or other work-related needs. For example:

- `Employees receive a monthly remote work stipend to cover expenses like electricity and Wi-Fi.` - Workers get extra money every month to help pay for home office costs.

- `My remote work stipend helped me buy a better monitor for my setup.` - The speaker used the company-provided money to improve their work-from-home setup.
