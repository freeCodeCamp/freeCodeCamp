<!-- (Audio) Anna: That's a valid point. However, we've been using collaboration tools to keep everyone connected. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`That's a valid point. BLANK, we've been using collaboration tools to keep everyone connected.`

## --blanks--

`However`

### --feedback--

This word is used to introduce a contrasting idea. The first letter is capitalized.

# --explanation--

`However` is used to acknowledge an opposing view before presenting a counterargument. This structure makes disagreements more balanced and respectful in discussions. For example:

- `The app is user-friendly. However, it still has some performance issues.` - The app is easy to use, but there are speed problems.

- `The software update improved security. However, it introduced a few new bugs.` - The update made the system safer, but it also created some issues.

Anna first agrees with David's concern by saying `Thatâ€™s a valid point`. Then, she introduces a different perspective using `however` to explain that collaboration tools help solve the problem.
