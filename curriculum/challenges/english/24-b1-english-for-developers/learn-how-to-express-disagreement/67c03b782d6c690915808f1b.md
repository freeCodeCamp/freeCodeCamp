# --explanation--

`Stick with` means to continue with a choice or decision instead of changing it. For example:

- `I tried a new coding tool, but I'll stick with the one I know.` - You will continue using the tool you're familiar with.

- `He wanted to switch to a different project, but he decided to stick with his current one.` - He chose to continue working on the same project.

Bob believes that choosing one category instead of splitting the stipend would make things simpler.
