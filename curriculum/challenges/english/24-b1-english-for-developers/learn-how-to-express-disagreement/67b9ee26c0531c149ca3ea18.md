## --sentence--

`It takes some adjustment, but once people BLANK it, it works quite well.`

## --blanks--

`get used to`

### --feedback--

This phrase means to become familiar or comfortable with something over time.

# --explanation--

`Get used to` means to adapt to something new. It is usually followed by a noun or the `-ing` form. For example:

- `New remote employees need time to get used to asynchronous communication.` - Remote workers may struggle at first, but they will eventually adapt to this way of working.

- `I can't get used to working without dual monitors.` - The speaker finds it difficult to adapt to using just one screen.

Anna is saying that asynchronous remote work might feel unfamiliar at first, but over time, people adjust and find that it works well.
