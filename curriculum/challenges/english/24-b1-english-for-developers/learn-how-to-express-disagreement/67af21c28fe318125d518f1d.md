# --explanation--

`I'm not sure` is used to express uncertainty or doubt. This phrase is often used when someone wants to express hesitation or a mild disagreement in a polite way. For example:

- Person 1: `Should we use Python or JavaScript for this automation?`

- Person 2: `I'm not sure. It depends on the project requirements.` - This person doesn't know the best choice without more details.
