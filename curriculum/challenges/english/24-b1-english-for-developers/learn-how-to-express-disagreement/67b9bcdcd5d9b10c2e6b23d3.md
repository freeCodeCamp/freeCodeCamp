# --explanation--

`Delays` happen when something takes longer than expected. For example:

`Poor time management can result in project delays.` - If a team doesn't manage tasks well, the project may take longer.

`Miscommunication` happens when people misunderstand each other due to unclear messages. This can lead to mistakes and confusion. For example:

`Miscommunication between departments delayed the product launch.` - Different teams weren't aligned, which caused setbacks.
