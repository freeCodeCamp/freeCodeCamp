# --explanation--

A `computer upgrade` means improving a computer by adding or replacing parts like more memory (RAM), a faster processor, or a better screen. For example:

- `I need a computer upgrade to run the latest software.` - The speaker's current computer is not powerful enough, so they need a better one.

- `After the computer upgrade, everything runs much faster.` -  The system's performance improved after updating or replacing components.
