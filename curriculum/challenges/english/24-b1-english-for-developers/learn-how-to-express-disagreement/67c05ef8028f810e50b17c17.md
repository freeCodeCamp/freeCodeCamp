# --explanation--

`Wouldn't it be simpler` is often used when suggesting a solution that seems obvious or logical. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's schedule three different meetings for each topic.`

- Person 2: `Wouldn't it be simpler to have one meeting and cover everything?` - This person suggests combining meetings into one to save time.

In this dialogue, Anna believes that allowing people to decide how to use their stipend is a simpler and better approach.
