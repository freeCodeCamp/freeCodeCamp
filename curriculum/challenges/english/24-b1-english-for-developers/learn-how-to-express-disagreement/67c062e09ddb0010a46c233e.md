<!-- (Audio) Anna: I see your point, but flexibility might be better. Think about it: wouldn't it be simpler to let people decide how to use their stipend based on their individual needs? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

You understand Anna's point, but want to introduce a different perspective. What would you say?

## --answers--

`Maybe, but we also need to ensure everyone has the basic equipment to work remotely.`

---

`I completely agree. Everyone should use their stipend however they want, with no guidelines.`

### --feedback--

While Anna supports flexibility, she does not say there should be no guidelines at all.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Maybe, but` is used to acknowledge someone's point while introducing a different perspective. For example:

- Person 1: `We could move the meeting to the afternoon.`

- Person 2: `Maybe, but some people might not be available then.` - This person sees the possibility but points out a potential issue with timing.

In the correct response, you agree that flexibility is good but highlight another important consideration.
