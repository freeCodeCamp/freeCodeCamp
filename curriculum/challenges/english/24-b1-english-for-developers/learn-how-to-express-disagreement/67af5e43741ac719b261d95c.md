# --explanation--

Anna uses `asynchronous` to describe a way of working where employees do not need to be online at the same time. This approach allows for `flexibility`, meaning that employees can choose when to complete their tasks instead of following a fixed schedule. This helps people balance work and personal responsibilities.
