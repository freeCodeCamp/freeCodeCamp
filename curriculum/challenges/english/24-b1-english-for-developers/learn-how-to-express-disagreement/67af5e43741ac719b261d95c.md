## --blanks--

`asynchronous`

### --feedback--

This word means that work does not happen at the same time for everyone.

---

`flexibility`

### --feedback--

This word means having the ability to adapt schedules or work conditions as needed.

# --explanation--

Anna uses `asynchronous` to describe a way of working where employees do not need to be online at the same time.

This approach allows for `flexibility`, meaning that employees can choose when to complete their tasks instead of following a fixed schedule. This helps people balance work and personal responsibilities.
