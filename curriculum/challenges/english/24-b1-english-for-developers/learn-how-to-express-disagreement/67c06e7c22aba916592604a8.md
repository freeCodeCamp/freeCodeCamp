<!-- (Audio) Bob: What if we set a minimum requirement, and anything beyond that can be used for personal preferences? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

You're not completely sure about Bob's idea but agree with him. What would you say?

## --answers--

`I don't know. Let's not change anything.`

### --feedback--

Bob is offering a possible improvement, so this response avoids engaging with his idea.

---

`That could work.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`That could work` is a way to express careful agreement. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's switch the project deadline to next Friday.`

- Person 2: `That could work, but we need to make sure we have enough time.` - This person agrees with the new deadline, but they're concerned about having enough time to finish.

This phrase is useful in discussions when you want to show openness to an idea without fully committing to it yet.
