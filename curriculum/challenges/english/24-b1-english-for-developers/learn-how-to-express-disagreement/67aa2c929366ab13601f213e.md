# --explanation--

`Productivity` means how much work a person can complete in a given time. Better tools (like upgraded computers) can help employees work more efficiently. For example:

- `Using automation tools can boost productivity.` - Automating tasks helps people work more efficiently and get more done.

- `Distractions reduce productivity when working remotely.` - Interruptions make it harder to focus and complete tasks effectively.
