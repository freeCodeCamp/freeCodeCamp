# --explanation--

`Split into parts` means to divide something into sections. For example:

- `When working on a large project, it's helpful to split it into parts to make it more manageable.` - This means dividing a big task or project into smaller, more manageable sections.

- `To understand the problem better, let's split the problem into parts and address each one.` - This suggests breaking down a problem into smaller components to find solutions more easily.

Anna is suggesting that instead of choosing between technology or office furniture, they divide the stipend to use for both.
