# --explanation--

`Remote work` means working from a location outside the traditional office, usually from home. For example:

- `Remote work allows developers to collaborate from different time zones.` - Working remotely enables team members to contribute from various locations.

- `Remote work improves flexibility but requires good time management.` - Working from home offers freedom but also demands discipline.
