# --explanation--

`Don't mention it` is a polite way to respond to someone thanking you. It means that no thanks are necessary. For example:

- Person 1: `I appreciate you taking the time to explain that process to me.`

- Person 2: `Don't mention it. I'm always here to help!` - This person is reassuring that helping is no trouble at all.

Anna says this after David thanks her for the idea, showing that she is happy to help.
