`It seems like it could lead to a lot of BLANK and BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`delays`

### --feedback--

---

`miscommunication`

### --feedback--

This word refers to misunderstandings caused by unclear or incorrect information.

# --explanation--

David is concerned that asynchronous remote work might cause `delays` (slower responses and progress) and `miscommunication` (people misunderstanding each other).

Since employees work at different times, messages may take longer to be answered, and misunderstandings may happen if communication isn't clear.
