## --sentence--

`Instead of just talking about best practices, what if we created BLANK or BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`hands-on exercises`

### --feedback--

This three-word phrase means practical activities, involving direct experience rather than theory. Remember to use `-` between the first two.

---

`interactive sessions`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means involving participation, where people actively engage instead of just listening.

# --explanation--

Brian suggests two methods to make learning more effective.

`Hands-on exercises` means activities where participants actively practice instead of just listening. For example:

`The training included hands-on exercises to practice coding.` - People got to actually write code, not just watch.

`Interactive sessions` are training sessions where participants engage actively rather than just listening to a lecture.

`The course had interactive sessions where we asked questions.` - Students could talk and take part, not just listen.
