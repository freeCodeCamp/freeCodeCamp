# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`You're right. We BLANK covered that more thoroughly in the last session.`

## --blanks--

`should have`

### --feedback--

The first word is used to talk about something that was the correct action but was not done, and the second one is part of the perfect verb structure.

# --explanation--

Alice agrees with Brian and admits that it would have been better to cover the topic more carefully during the last session.

She uses `should have` + `Past Participle` structure to express regret or a missed opportunity in the past.
