## --blanks--

`code submission`

`loop structure`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase describes how loops are arranged in programming.

# --explanation--

A `code submission` is the set of code files that a programmer submits for review. For example:

- `Make sure your code submission follows the guidelines.` - Your code must meet the rules before you send it.

- `The professor reviewed my code submission and gave feedback.` - The professor checked your code and shared comments.

A `loop structure` is the way a loop is organized in programming, such as `for` loops or `while` loops. For example:

- `The loop structure in my code runs five times.` - Your loop repeats five times in the program.

- `A loop structure allows a program to repeat actions.` - A loop helps a program do the same thing multiple times.
