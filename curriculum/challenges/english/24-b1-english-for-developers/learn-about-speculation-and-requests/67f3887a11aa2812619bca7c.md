# --explanation--

Jake says `sometimes`, which means it happens occasionally, but not always. For example:

`Sometimes, the server needs a restart to fix issues.` - Restarting the server helps solve problems from time to time.

Jake is saying that weak passwords and shared credentials are possible causes, but not the only ones. Unauthorized access can also happen because of phishing, malware, or system vulnerabilities.
