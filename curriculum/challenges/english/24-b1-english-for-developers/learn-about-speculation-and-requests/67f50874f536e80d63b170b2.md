`SQL injection attempts`

### --feedback--

This three-word phrase refers to an attack which involves inserting malicious code. The first word stands for `Structured Query Language`.

# --explanation--

`Brute force attacks` are when hackers try multiple passwords until they find the right one. For example:

`The system detected a brute force attack on the login page.` - The attack tried many password guesses to break in.

`SQL injection attempts` happen when hackers try to insert malicious SQL code to access or modify a database. For example:

`The firewall stopped two SQL injection attempts.` - Someone tried to hack the database using harmful code.
