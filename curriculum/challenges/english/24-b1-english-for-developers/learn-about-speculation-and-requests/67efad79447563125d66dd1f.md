## --sentence--

`Sophie: Hey Mark, I was reviewing your latest BLANK, and I noticed a small error in the loop structure. It's not a big deal, but we should fix it before it causes problems. Can we talk about it?`

`Mark: Sure, Sophie. What did I do wrong?`

`Sophie: You used a simple for loop, but given our use case, you should have used a while loop instead. The for loop might not account for all the BLANK, which could lead to unexpected behavior.`

`Mark: Oh, I see. I should have checked the requirements more carefully. Thanks for pointing that out.`

`Sophie: No problem. You should also BLANK comments in your code. It makes it easier for others to understand what you're doing. You could have added a comment explaining why you chose a particular loop structure.`

`Mark: Got it. I should have been more thorough with my comments. I'll fix that and BLANK to use a while loop next time.`

`Sophie: Great. Also, you should have run the BLANK before submitting your code. It would have caught the error early on and saved you some time. Did you run the tests?`

`Mark: No, I didn't. I should have, but I was in a hurry. I guess I should make it a habit to run tests every time.`

`Sophie: Absolutely. It's a BLANK, and it helps avoid mistakes. Don't worry, though. We all mess up sometimes. We all learn from our mistakes.`

`Mark: Thanks, Sophie. I appreciate your feedback. I'll correct the code and run the tests. If there's anything else I should do, let me know.`

`Sophie: Will do. Just remember to take your time and BLANK your work. It's better to be thorough than to rush and miss something.`
