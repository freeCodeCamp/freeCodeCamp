`Report of` is used to describe the subject of a report. The correct preposition after `report` in this case is `of` because it shows what was reported. For example:

`We received a report of an accident.` - The report was about an accident.

`Report` can also be used with `to` when talking about who someone gives updates or answers to. For example:

`I report to the team leader every day.` - You give updates to your boss every day.
