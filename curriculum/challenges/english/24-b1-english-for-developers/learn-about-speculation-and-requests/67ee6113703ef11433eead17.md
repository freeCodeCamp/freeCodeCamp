<!-- (audio) Sophie: The for loop might not account for all the edge cases, which could lead to unexpected behavior. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does Sophie explain Mark's error?

## --answers--

The `for` loop always works perfectly in all cases.

### --feedback--

Sophie warns that it might not work in all situations.

---

The `for` loop must cause an error every time.

### --feedback--

Sophie does not say that the error will always happen.

---

The `for` loop is better than a `while` loop in every case.

### --feedback--

Sophie suggests that in this situation, a `while` loop is a better choice.

---

The `for` loop might not handle all edge cases, and this could cause unexpected behavior.

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

Sophie is warning that the `for` loop `might` not cover all edge cases, meaning it is possible but not guaranteed. If that happens, it `could` result in unexpected behavior.

- `The for loop might not account for all edge cases.` - There is a chance that some cases are missed.

- `This could lead to unexpected behavior.` - If the loop misses edge cases, the program may not work correctly.
