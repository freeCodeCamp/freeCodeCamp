`while loop`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase refers to the loop that is used when the number of repetitions depends on a condition.

# --explanation--

A `for loop` is useful when you know how many times the loop should run. For example:

- `A for loop is useful for going through a list.` - You can use it to check each item in a list.

- `The for loop stops when it reaches the last item.` - The loop ends when there are no more items.

A `while loop` is better when the number of repetitions depends on a condition. For example:

- `A while loop runs until a condition is false.` - The loop continues as long as the rule is true.

- `Be careful, a while loop can run forever!` - If you don't stop it, the loop won't end.
