<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

# --questions--

## --text--

Jake thinks there's a possibility. What could he say?

## --answers--

`It's possible.`

---

`It's impossible.`

### --feedback--

`Impossible` means there is no chance, but Jake believes there is a possibility.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Jake can say `It's possible` because he thinks there is a chance that the suspicious email was part of a phishing attack.

`Impossible` is formed by adding the prefix `im-` (which means "not" or "the opposite of") to the base word `possible`. For example:

- `It's possible.` - Something can happen.

- `It's impossible.` - It cannot happen.
