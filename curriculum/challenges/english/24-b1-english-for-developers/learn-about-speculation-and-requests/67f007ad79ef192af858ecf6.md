# --explanation--

Jake can say `It's possible` because he thinks there is a chance that the suspicious email was part of a phishing attack.

`Impossible` comes from the prefix `im-`, which means **not** or **the opposite of**. For example:

- `It's possible.` - Something can happen.

- `It's impossible.` - It cannot happen.
