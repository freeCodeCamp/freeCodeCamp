<!-- (audio) Sophie: The for loop might not account for all the edge cases, which could lead to unexpected behavior. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Mark understands what he did wrong. What should he say?

## --answers--

`Oh, I see.`

---

`What do you mean?`

### --feedback--

This is something Mark would say if he did not understand.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Oh, I see` is a short and natural way to say `Now I understand`. For example:

- Person 1: `The deadline has been moved to next week.`

- Person 2: `Oh, I see. That gives us more time to finish the project.` - This person understands that the deadline change is good for more time to work.

The correct answer shows that Mark understands the mistake and acknowledges the explanation. It's a common phrase used to indicate understanding.
