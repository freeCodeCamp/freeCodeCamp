# --explanation--

To understand Jake's comment, listen for the phrase `firewall rules can sometimes be misconfigured.`

`Misconfigured` means set up in the wrong way. For example:

`The server went down because of a misconfigured setting.` – This means someone made a mistake when setting up the system.

`Sometimes` shows that this doesn't always happen, but it is possible. Jake is saying that firewall rules are not perfect — errors can happen.
