# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Will do. Thanks, Jake. I'll run through the logs and check the security cameras for any BLANK breaches.`

## --blanks--

`physical access`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase refers to someone physically entering a restricted area rather than hacking into a system remotely.

# --explanation--

`Physical access` means gaining entry to a place, such as an office or server room.

A `physical access breach` happens when someone enters a secure location without permission. For example:

- `To avoid a physical access breach, we should require ID checks at the entrance.` - A company can prevent unauthorized entry by checking IDs at the door.

- `A physical access breach can happen if someone enters the server room without permission.` - A physical security issue can occur if someone goes into the server room without authorization.
