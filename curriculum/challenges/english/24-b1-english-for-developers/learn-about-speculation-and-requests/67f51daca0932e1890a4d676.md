# --explanation--

Jake is asking Jessica to notify him right away if she sees anything suspicious.

He uses a `First Conditional` sentence, which expresses a real possibility in the future. It follows the `If` + `Present Simple`, `will` + base verb (or an imperative). In this dialogue:

- `If you find anything unusual` is the condition.

- `Let me know immediately` is the result.
