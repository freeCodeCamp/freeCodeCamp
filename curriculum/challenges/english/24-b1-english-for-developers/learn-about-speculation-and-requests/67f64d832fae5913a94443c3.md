# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Alice want to create scenarios that developers can work through?

## --answers--

To replace best practices with their own methods.

### --feedback--

Alice wants to apply best practices, not replace them.

---

To test developers on random skills.

### --feedback--

Alice's goal is not to test unrelated skills.

---

To help developers see how best practices are applied in real-life situations.

---

To make training more difficult without adding value.

### --feedback--

Alice suggests this to improve learning, not to make it harder without a purpose.

## --video-solution--

3

# --explanation--

Alice wants to create scenarios so developers can practice best practices in real-life situations. This makes learning more practical and effective.

By working through real-life situations, developers:

- Understand how best practices apply in practice.

- Learn problem-solving in real-world conditions.

- Gain hands-on experience instead of just listening to theory.
