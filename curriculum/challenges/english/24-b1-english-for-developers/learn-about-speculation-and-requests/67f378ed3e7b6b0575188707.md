Phishing attacks often trick users into clicking `malicious links`, leading to `unauthorized access` to accounts or systems.

`Unauthorized access` means someone enters a system without permission. For example:

`Malicious link` refers to a harmful link that can steal information or infect a system. For example:

`The email had a malicious link inside.` - The email included a bad link made to trick you.
