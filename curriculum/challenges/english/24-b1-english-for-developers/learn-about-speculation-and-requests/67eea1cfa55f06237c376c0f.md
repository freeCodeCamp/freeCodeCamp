# --explanation--

`Could have` + `Past Participle` is used to talk about something that was possible but did not happen. For example:

- `You could have added a comment to explain this function.` - It would have been helpful if you included a comment to explain what the function does.

- `We could have added a search bar to make the website more user-friendly.` - The team was thinking about adding a search bar, but it wasn't done yet.
