# --explanation--

`Out of the ordinary` means something unusual or unexpected. For example:

- `The login pattern looked out of the ordinary.` - The way someone logged in didn't look normal.

- `We saw traffic that was out of the ordinary.` - There was unusual activity on the network.

Jake is asking if the team saw anything strange or unusual related to security.
