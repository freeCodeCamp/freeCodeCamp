# --questions--

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Jessica is confirming that she will notify Jake and is thanking him for his help.

`Will do` is a casual way of saying `I will do that`. For example:

- Person 1: `Can you send me the report by 3 PM?`

- Person 2: `Will do.` - This person is confirming that they'll take action. It's like saying `Got it` or `I'll handle it`.
