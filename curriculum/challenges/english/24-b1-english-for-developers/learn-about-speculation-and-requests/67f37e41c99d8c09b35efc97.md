# --explanation--

Jake says, `to see if there's any unusual activity or failed login attempts`. This means he wants to look for signs of suspicious behavior in the system.

- `Unusual activity` can mean strange or unexpected actions, like accessing files at odd hours.

- `Failed login attempts` are signs that someone may have tried to access the system without the correct password.

Audit logs help track these things and are useful for investigating potential security problems.
