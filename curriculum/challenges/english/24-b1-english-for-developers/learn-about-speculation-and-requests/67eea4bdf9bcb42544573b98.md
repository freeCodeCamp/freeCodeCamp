# --explanation--

`Got it` is a casual way to say you understand something. For example:

- Person 1: `Please send the report by the end of the day.`

- Person 2: `Got it, I'll send it shortly.` - This person confirms they will complete the task.

It is commonly used in conversations when someone understands instructions or feedback.
