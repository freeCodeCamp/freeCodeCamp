# --explanation--

A `scenario` is a planned situation that helps people understand how to apply knowledge in real life. Scenarios are useful in training because they make learning more practical and engaging. For example:

`We practiced what to do in a worst-case scenario.` - They trained for a serious or dangerous situation.

A `real-life` situation is something that happens in the real world, not just as an example or theory. For example:

`In a real-life situation, you might not have much time to decide.` - Things can be fast and stressful in real life.
