It's a base verb (`check`) in the `Past Participle`.

# --explanation--

`Should have` + `Past Participle` is used to say that something was a mistake or should have been done differently. For example:

`You should have saved your work.` - You didn't save it, and now it's lost.

Mark says he `should have checked` the requirements more carefully as he didn't do it properly.
