# --explanation--

`In a hurry` means to have not enough time. For example:

- `I was in a hurry and forgot to save the file.` - The person rushed and didn't save their work.

- `They launched the app in a hurry and skipped testing.` - The team released the app too fast without proper checks.

Even though Mark knows he should have run the tests, he skipped it due to being rushed.
