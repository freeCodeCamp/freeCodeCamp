# --explanation--

A `test suite` is a collection of tests that check if a program works correctly. For example:

- `We ran the test suite to check if the app works properly.` - The team executed all the tests to ensure the app functions as expected.

- `We need to add more tests to the test suite to check for edge cases.` - The team should include more tests to cover all possible situations.
