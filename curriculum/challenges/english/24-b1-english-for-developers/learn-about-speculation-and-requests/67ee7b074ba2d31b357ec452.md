# --explanation--

`Thanks for pointing that out` is a way to thank someone for making you aware of your mistake or detail. For example:

- Person 1: `The design looks great, but the colors need a little adjustment.`

- Person 2: `Thanks for pointing that out. I'll tweak the colors to make it better.` - This person appreciates the suggestion and plans to improve the design.
