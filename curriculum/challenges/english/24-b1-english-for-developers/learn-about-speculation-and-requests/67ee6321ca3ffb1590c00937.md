`unexpected behavior`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase refers to results that the programmer did not intend or predict.

# --explanation--

An `edge case` is a rare or extreme situation that might cause problems in a program. For example:

`We need to test the app with edge cases to make sure it works in all situations.` - You need to test unusual situations to ensure the app is working properly.

`Unexpected behavior` happens when a program does something the programmer did not expect. For example:

`The app showed unexpected behavior when I tried to open it.` - The app didn't work as expected when you tried to open it.
