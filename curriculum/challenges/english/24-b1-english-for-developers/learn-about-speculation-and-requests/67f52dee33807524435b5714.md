## --text--

Jessica found something unusual and decided to inform Jake and the incident response team. Here's her email:

`Subject: Urgent: Unusual Activity Detected – Security Investigation`

`Hi team,`

`I was reviewing the logs from last night's reported security breach and noticed some unusual activity. While all security updates appear to be applied, I found odd patterns in the audit logs that could be related to the incident. I haven't confirmed the cause yet, but there is a possibility of a phishing attack, as we received reports of a suspicious email.`

`We should also check for:`

`1. Unauthorized access attempts – There might be failed logins or unusual access from external IPs.`

`2. Weak passwords or shared credentials – This could have been exploited.`

`3. Firewall configurations – There might be a misconfiguration allowing unauthorized traffic.`

`4. Signs of brute force or SQL injection attacks – These should be investigated further.`

`I'm also reaching out to the team to see if anyone noticed anything suspicious. If we find more signs of unauthorized access, we may need to escalate the situation. I'll keep you updated as I gather more information.`

`Let me know if you find anything on your end.`

`Best,`

`Jessica`

# --explanation--

Jessica states that if they find more signs of unauthorized access, they `may need to escalate the situation`. This means the security team may need to take stronger action, such as reporting to management or enforcing additional security measures.

Focus on the sentence that starts with `If we find more signs...`.
