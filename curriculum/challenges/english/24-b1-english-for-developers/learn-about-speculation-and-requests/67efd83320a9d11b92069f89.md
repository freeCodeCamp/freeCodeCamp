# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, listen for the key words in Jessica's sentence: `we had a security breach reported.`

The word `reported` is important. It means someone noticed the problem and told others about it.

Jessica doesn't say the breach was `fixed`, `checked`, or that a new system was `installed`. She only says it was `reported`.
