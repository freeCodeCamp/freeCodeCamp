# --explanation--

Jessica is deciding if they should involve a higher-level team or keep investigating the issue themselves.

`Escalate this` means to raise the issue to a more specialized or higher authority â€” in this case, the `incident response team`. This is often done when a situation is serious or beyond the current team's control.

`Keep investigating` shows she is considering continuing their own efforts before involving others.
