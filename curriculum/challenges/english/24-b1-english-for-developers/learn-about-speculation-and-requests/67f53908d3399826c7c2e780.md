`wanted`

### --feedback--

This is the past tense of `want`, indicating that Alice had a desire to talk about it earlier.

# --explanation--

`Want` expresses a desire to do something. In the past, we say `wanted` to show that the desire existed at an earlier time. It is followed by the infinitive of a verb (with `to`). For example:

- `She wants to install the new software.` - She wants to do this now or soon.

- `They wanted to upgrade their system last week.` - In the past, they planned to upgrade.
