## --sentence--

`Alice: Hey, Brian. I wanted to talk about the upcoming technical BLANK. I was hoping you could help me decide which topics to focus on. Any suggestions?`

`Brian: Sure, Alice. I think we should emphasize security BLANK, especially after that recent security breach. The team might have overlooked some key protocols.`

`Alice: You're right. We should have covered that more thoroughly in the last session. Maybe we can start with a BLANK of what went wrong and how to avoid it in the future.`

`Brian: That's a good idea. But if the training approach isn't getting the results we expect, maybe we should switch things up. Instead of just talking about best practices, what if we created hands-on exercises or interactive sessions?`

`Alice: I like that idea. We could create BLANK that developers can work through to see how best practices are applied in real-life situations. This could make the training more engaging.`

`Brian: Exactly. And we could encourage peer-to-peer learning, where the developers share experiences and solutions. It might promote a more BLANK.`

`Alice: That sounds great. The developers should also have a chance to ask questions and discuss BLANK. If we make the training more interactive, it could lead to better learning outcomes.`

`Brian: Totally agree. I'll work on revising the training plan with more hands-on activities. Let me know if you have any other suggestions.`

`Alice: Will do. Thanks, Brian. I think this new approach could be a BLANK for our training sessions.`
