# --explanation--

The modal verb `might` is followed by `have` + `Past Participle` to express a possibility in the past. This structure is used when you're not sure if something happened, but think it's possible.

- Correct: `They might have missed the deadline.`

- Incorrect: `They might has missed...`, `They might missed...`, or `They might had missed...`
