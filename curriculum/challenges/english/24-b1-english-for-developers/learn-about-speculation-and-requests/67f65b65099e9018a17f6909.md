# --explanation--

Brian is not 100% sure, but he thinks maybe the peer-to-peer learning can help create a collaborative environment. That's why he says `might`.

A `collaborative environment` is a workplace or setting where people work together and share ideas. For example:

- `Our team works well in a collaborative environment.` - They do a good job when they work together.

- `A collaborative environment helps people share ideas.` - When people work together, they can give and get more ideas.
