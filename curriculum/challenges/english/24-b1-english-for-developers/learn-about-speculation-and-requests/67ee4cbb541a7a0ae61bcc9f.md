# --explanation--

`It's not a big deal` means the problem is not serious. For example:

- Person 1: `I can't join the meeting today.`

- Person 2: `It's not a big deal. I'll take notes for you.` - Missing the meeting is okay, and this person can help.

Sophie also says `we should fix it before it causes problems`, meaning it's better to fix it now before it becomes serious.
