# --explanation--

Jessica says she noticed some `odd patterns` in the logs.

- `Odd` means strange or unusual.

- `Patterns` refer to repeated behaviors or sequences in data.

Together, `odd patterns` means unusual or unexpected behavior in the logs. For example:

- `We noticed some odd patterns in the website traffic.` - The traffic was behaving in a way that's not typical or expected.

- `The error logs showed odd patterns of behavior in the code.` - The code was acting strangely, not how it usually does.
