# --explanation--

`Could it have been...?` is a way of asking if something might have happened.

`Could` expresses possibility.

`Have been` is used to talk about something that possibly happened in the past.

Jessica is guessing or suggesting a possibility. Another example:

`Could it have been the update that broke the app?` - Someone is asking if the update caused the app to stop working.
