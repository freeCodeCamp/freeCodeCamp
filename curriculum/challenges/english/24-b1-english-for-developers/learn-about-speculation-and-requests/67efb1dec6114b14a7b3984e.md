Sophie wanted to remind the team about the requirements they must follow. Here's her email:

`Subject: Reminder: Follow the Requirements Carefully`

`Hi team,`

`I hope you're all doing well! I wanted to send a quick reminder about the key requirements we must follow when submitting our code. To ensure everything runs smoothly, we must be thorough and follow these steps:`

`1. Use the correct loop structure - In some cases, a while loop should be used instead of a for loop to account for all edge cases. Please review the logic carefully before submitting your code.`

`2. Include comments - You should add clear comments explaining complex parts of your code. This makes it easier for others to understand and maintain.`

`3. Run the test suite - Before submission, you must run all tests. This could help catch errors early and save time later.`

`Let's make sure we follow these guidelines to maintain code quality and avoid unnecessary issues. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out!`

`Best,`

`Sophie`
