# --explanation--

`No one mentioned anything` means nobody reported anything unusual.

`Ask around` means to talk to different people to gather information. For example:

- `I'll ask around to see if anyone changed the settings.` - You will talk to people to find out who changed the settings.

- `He asked around about the new software tool.` - He talked to others to get more info about the tool.
