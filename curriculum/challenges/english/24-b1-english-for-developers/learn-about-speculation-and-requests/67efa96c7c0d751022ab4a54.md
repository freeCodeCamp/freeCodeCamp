# --explanation--

Sophie tells Mark to be careful and review his work before submitting it.

`Take your time` means to do something carefully without rushing. For example:

`Take your time to review the code before submitting it.` - There's no rush; take as long as you need to check the code.

`Double-check` means to review something again to make sure it is correct. For example:

`I will double-check the data before running the analysis.` - You will review the data one more time to make sure it's correct.
