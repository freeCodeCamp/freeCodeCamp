# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Got it. I BLANK been more thorough in my comments.`

## --blanks--

`should have`

### --feedback--

These two words are used to talk about a past action that would have been better.

# --explanation--

`Should have been` is followed by an adjective and is used to say that something should have happened in the past but didn't. For example:

- `I should have been more careful.` - You weren't careful, but it would have been better if you had been.

- `He should have been more prepared for the meeting.` - He wasn't prepared enough.

In this case, Mark means he should have been more detailed with his comments.
