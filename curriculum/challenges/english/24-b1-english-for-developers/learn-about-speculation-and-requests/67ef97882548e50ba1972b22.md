# --explanation--

Sophie uses kind and supportive language to help Mark feel better. She says `we all mess up sometimes` and `we all learn from our mistakes`. These phrases mean that making mistakes is normal and part of the learning process.

This kind of encouragement helps build confidence and shows that nobody is perfect. Everyone improves by learning from what went wrong.
