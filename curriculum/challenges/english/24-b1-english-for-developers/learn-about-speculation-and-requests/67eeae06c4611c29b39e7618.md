<!-- (audio) Sophie: Great. Also, you should have run the test suite before submitting your code. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Great. Also, you BLANK the test suite before submitting your code.`

## --blanks--

`should have run`

### --feedback--

These three words are used to talk about something that would have been a good idea in the past but wasn't done.

# --explanation--

`Should have` + `Past Participle` is used to express regret or advice about the past. For example:

- `You should have run the program on a different machine to check for compatibility.` - Testing on a different machine would have been helpful, but it was not done.

- `I should have run the tests before deploying the app.` - Running tests was the right thing to do, but it wasn't done at the time.

In this case, Sophie is telling Mark that he should have run the test suite, meaning it was important, but he didn't do it.
