# --explanation--

Alice uses `First Conditional` to suggest that interactive training might improve learning outcomes.

`Outcomes` means the results or effects of an action or event. For example:

- `The outcome of the meeting was very positive.` - The result of the meeting was good.

- `They were happy with the outcome of the training.` - They liked what they learned from the training.
