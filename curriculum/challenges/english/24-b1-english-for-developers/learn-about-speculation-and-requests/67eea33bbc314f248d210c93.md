# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on how Sophie gives feedback.

She says `explaining why you chose a particular loop structure`. this shows that she isn't saying the loop is wrong â€” just that the decision behind it should have been explained.

This helps others understand the thinking behind the code, which is why comments are useful.
