# --explanation--

`Evidence of` means signs or proof that something has happened. For example:

`The report showed evidence of user error.` - The report showed that a person made a mistake.

A `brute force attack` is when someone tries many different passwords until one works.

An `SQL injection` is when someone tries to break into a system by putting harmful code into a search box or form.

Jake is talking about checking for signs of these types of attacks.
