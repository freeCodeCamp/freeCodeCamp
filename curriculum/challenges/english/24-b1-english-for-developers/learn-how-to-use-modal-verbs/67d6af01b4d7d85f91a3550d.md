# --explanation--

`Get overwhelmed` means that something receives too much at once and cannot handle it properly. For example:

- `The team got overwhelmed by all the tasks before the deadline.` - The team had too many tasks and felt stressed because of it.

- `The customer support team got overwhelmed with questions after the app update.` - The team received too many questions and couldn't answer them all quickly.

James explains that if too many users log in at once, the servers might struggle to handle the load and slow down or crash.
