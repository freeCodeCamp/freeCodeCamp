# --explanation--

Jessica is telling Mark to run `regular security audits` to ensure safety.

A `security audit` is a process of checking a system for vulnerabilities. For example:

`After the security audit, the team made improvements to the system.` - Changes were made to improve safety after the review.

`Regular` means happening consistently over time. For example:

`Regular testing helps find problems before they get worse.` - Testing things often helps catch issues early.
