<!-- (audio) James: If we find critical bugs, we'll probably have to roll back the deployment and fix them before trying again. It might delay the release, but it's better than having a broken product.-->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Sophie agrees with James and points out another thing she's curious about. What would she say?

## --answers--

`I don't think that's right.`

### --feedback--

This does not show agreement; it expresses disagreement.

---

`I agree. Another thing I'm curious about is performance.`

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

To agree with someone, you can use phrases like:

- `I agree.`

- `That makes sense.`

- `You're right.`

To add another point, you can use:

- `Another thing I'm curious about is...`

- `One more thing I'd like to know is...`

Sophie first agrees with James (`I agree.`) and then introduces a new topic she wants to discuss (`Another thing I'm curious about is performance.`).
