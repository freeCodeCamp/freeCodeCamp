# --explanation--

To agree with someone, you can use phrases like:

- `I agree.`

- `That makes sense.`

- `You're right.`

To add another point, you can use:

- `Another thing I'm curious about is...`

- `One more thing I'd like to know is...`

Sophie first agrees with James (`I agree.`) and then introduces a new topic she wants to discuss (`Another thing I'm curious about is performance.`).
