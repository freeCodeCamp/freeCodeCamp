`Figure out` is a phrasal verb meaning to solve or understand something that is difficult. For example:

`We need to figure out why the website isn't loading.` - We need to understand the reason why the website is not working.

A `firewall` is a security feature that protects computer networks from hackers. It works like a digital barrier, allowing safe data in while blocking dangerous traffic. For example:

`Make sure the firewall is active before you connect to the internet.` - Ensure the security system is on before using the internet.
