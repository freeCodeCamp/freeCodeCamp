# --explanation--

`Must have happened` is used to make a logical guess about something in the past.  

`Must` expresses strong certainty. `Have` + `Past Participle` (like `happened`) refers to something in the past. For example:

- `He must have forgotten to update the system.` - It's likely that he didn't remember to do the update.

- `They must have made some changes to the app.` - It's likely that the app has been updated or improved.

Jake is using evidence (`unusual activity on the servers`) to conclude that the breach `must have happened` last night. This structure is useful for making logical assumptions in English.
