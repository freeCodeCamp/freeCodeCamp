# --explanation--

Jake emphasizes the urgency of investigating the security breach.

`Need to` + verb is a common structure used to express something important or necessary. For example:

`We need to improve security.` - This means improving security is required.  

`Find out` means to discover or learn information. For example:

`I need to find out who accessed the system.` - This means the speaker must investigate and get information.
