# --explanation--

In questions, modal verbs like `can`, `could`, and `should` come before the subject. The verb that follows must be in its base form. That's why you say `Could you help?` instead of `Do you can help?` or `Can helping?`

For example, in `Should we report this issue?` and `Might he know the password?` The modal verb comes first, and the main verb stays in its base form.

Using `do` or `does` with a modal verb is incorrect. You don't say `Do you can reset the system?` Instead, say `Can you reset the system?`

Word order is important in English questions. Saying `You can help me?` sounds unnatural because the subject and the modal verb are not in the right order. The correct form is `Can you help me?`
