## --sentence--

`BLANK, do we have to follow any specific guidelines for data encryption?`

## --blanks--

`By the way`

### --feedback--

This three-words phrase introduces a new topic or question that is somewhat related but not the main focus. The first letter is capitalized.

# --explanation--

`By the way` is used to bring up additional information or ask a related question. For example:

- `By the way, did you check your email?` - Someone is changing the topic to ask if you looked at your email.

- `That was a great presentation. By the way, when is the next one?` - Someone is giving a compliment and then asking about the next presentation.

Mark finished discussing one topic and smoothly transitions to asking about data encryption.
