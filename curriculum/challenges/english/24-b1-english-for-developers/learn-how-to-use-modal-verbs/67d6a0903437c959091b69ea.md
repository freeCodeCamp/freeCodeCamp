# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on James' reasoning.

- `It might delay the release...` – This shows James is aware of a possible delay.

- `...better than having a broken product.` – This highlights that the worst-case scenario is releasing a product with serious bugs.

James is saying that fixing issues, even if it causes a delay, is better than launching a faulty product.
