`Could` and `might` are modal verbs used to talk about possibilities.

`Could` means something is possible but not certain. For example:

`This update could make the app run faster.` - The update has the potential to improve the app's speed.

`Might` also expresses possibility but often suggests a lower chance than `could`. For example:

`The new feature might improve the user experience.` - It is possible that the feature will make the experience better.
