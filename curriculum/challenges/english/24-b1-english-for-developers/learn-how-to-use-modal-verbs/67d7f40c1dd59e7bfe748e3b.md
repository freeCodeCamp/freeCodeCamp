# --explanation--

`Unusual activity` refers to behavior that is different from normal. For example:

- `We should investigate any unusual activity on the website.` - We need to check if something strange is happening on the site.

- `If you notice unusual activity, please report it immediately.` - If you see anything odd, you should inform someone right away.

In this case, `unusual activity` on the servers means that something strange was happening on the network, which could be a sign of a security breach.
