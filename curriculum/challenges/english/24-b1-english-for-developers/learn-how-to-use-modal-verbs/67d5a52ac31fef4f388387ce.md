`That makes sense. If we find bugs during deployment, what BLANK the immediate response?`

## --blanks--

`would be`

### --feedback--

Think about how we talk about hypothetical situations or things that might happen in the future.

# --explanation--

`Would` is used in questions to ask about hypothetical or possible situations. For example:

- `What would you do if you won the lottery?` - This asks about a possible but uncertain event.

- `How would the team react if the software crashed?` - This asks about a possible response.

Sophie is asking what would happen if they find bugs during deployment, meaning she is considering a possible situation.
