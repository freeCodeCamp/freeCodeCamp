# --explanation--

Remember:

`May` expresses possibility or permission (e.g., `May I use your phone?`).

`Might` indicates a smaller possibility than `may`, often used for less certain situations (e.g., `She might come to the meeting.`).

`Can` expresses ability or permission (e.g., `Can I leave early?`).

`Could` is used for past ability, polite requests, or a less certain possibility than `can` (e.g., `Could you help me?`).
