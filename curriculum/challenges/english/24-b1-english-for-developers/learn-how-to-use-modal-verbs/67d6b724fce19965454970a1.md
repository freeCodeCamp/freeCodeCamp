# --explanation--

Remember:

`May` expresses possibility or permission. For example:

`May I use your phone?`

`Might` indicates a smaller possibility than `may`, often used for less certain situations. For example:

`She might come to the meeting.`

`Can` expresses ability or permission. For example:

`Can I leave early?`

`Could` is used for past ability, polite requests, or a less certain possibility than `can`. For example:

`Could you help me?`
