<!-- (audio) Jake: Not yet, but we should focus on the critical systems first. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Is the team obligated to focus on the critical systems first?

## --answers--

No.

---

Yes.

### --feedback--

`Should` suggests a strong recommendation, not an obligation. If it were an obligation, Jake would say `must` instead of `should`.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Should` is a modal verb that expresses advice, recommendation, or the best course of action — but not an obligation.

- `You should update your password regularly.` - It's a good idea to change your password often for security.

- `You should check for errors in the code before running it.` - It's a good practice to find mistakes before executing the code.

Since Jake says `we should focus on the critical systems first`, he is giving a strong recommendation, but the team is not strictly obligated to do it.
