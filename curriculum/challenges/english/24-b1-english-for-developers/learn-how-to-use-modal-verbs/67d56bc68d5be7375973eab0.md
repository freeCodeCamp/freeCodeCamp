Mark decided to email Jessica to update her on his progress and to ask for guidance on a specific issue.

`Subject: Security Protocols Update – Encountering an Issue`

`Hi Jessica,`

`I've started working on the security protocols for the new project. I've updated my software tools to the latest versions and informed the team about setting up multi-factor authentication. Everyone, including QA, is aware that it's mandatory, and we're making sure it's properly implemented.`

`However, I've run into a problem with data encryption. I understand that all sensitive data must be encrypted and that encryption keys must be stored securely, but I'm not sure if we have a specific method or tool for this. Do we have any guidelines on which encryption standards to follow? Also, should we run any tests after encryption to ensure everything is secure?`

`Let me know how to proceed. Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`

`Mark`
