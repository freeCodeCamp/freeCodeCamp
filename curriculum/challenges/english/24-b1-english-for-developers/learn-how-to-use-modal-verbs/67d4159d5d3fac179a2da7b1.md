# --explanation--

`Multi-factor authentication` refers to a security process that requires multiple ways to confirm a user's identity. For example:

- `Many websites require multi-factor authentication to protect personal information.` - Many websites ask for extra security measures to keep personal data safe.

- `If you want more security, you should enable multi-factor authentication on your account.` - To make your account safer, you should turn on extra security.
