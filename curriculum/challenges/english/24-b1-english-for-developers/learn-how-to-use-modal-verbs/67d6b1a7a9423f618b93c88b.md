# --explanation--

`May` is a modal verb used to express permission, possibility, or a polite request. For example:

- `The app may have a bug that causes crashes.` - There's a possibility that the app has a problem.

- `You may find the new design easier to use.` - It's possible that the new design will be easier for you.

James uses `may need` to say that scaling up might be necessary, but they are not completely sure yet.
