# --explanation--

`Sensitive data` refers to confidential information that must be protected. For example:

`Sensitive data, like passwords, should never be shared.` - Private information, such as passwords, must stay secret.

`Encryption keys` are used to lock and unlock encrypted data. For example:

`Encryption keys help keep online payments secure.` - These special codes protect financial transactions.

Jessica's guidelines ensure that both are handled securely.
