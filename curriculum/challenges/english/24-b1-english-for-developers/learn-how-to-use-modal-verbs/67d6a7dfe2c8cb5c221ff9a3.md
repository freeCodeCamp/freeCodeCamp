# --explanation--

`High traffic` refers to a large number of users accessing a system at the same time. For example:

- `We need a stronger server to handle high traffic.` - A better server will help when many users visit the site.

- `During sales, online stores experience high traffic.` - Many people visit shopping websites when there are discounts.

Sophie is asking whether the servers might struggle when too many users try to access the system after the release.
