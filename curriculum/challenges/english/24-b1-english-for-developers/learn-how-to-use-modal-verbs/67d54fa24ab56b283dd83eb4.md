# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Yes, all sensitive data BLANK be encrypted, and you BLANK ensure that the encryption keys are stored securely.`

## --blanks--

`must`

### --feedback--

This modal verb expresses a strong necessity or obligation.

---

`have to`

### --feedback--

These two words express obligation but in a slightly less strong manner than `must`.

# --explanation--

Both `must` and `have to` express obligation or necessity, but there is a slight difference in their usage.

`Must` is used for strong internal obligation or official rules. It often sounds more formal or authoritative. For example:

`All sensitive data must be encrypted.` - A strict rule or requirement.

`Have to` is used for external obligation, often based on rules or circumstances rather than personal authority. For example:

`You have to ensure that the encryption keys are stored securely.` - A responsibility due to security policies.
