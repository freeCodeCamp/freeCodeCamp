# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on Jake's use of the word `targeted`.  

He says the breach wasn't random, which means he believes it was done for a specific reason. The phrase `there must be a reason` helps show that Jake is sure the attackers chose them on purpose, not by accident.
