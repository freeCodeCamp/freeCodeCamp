# --explanation--

`Most likely` refers to what has the highest probability of happening. For example:

- `It will most likely rain tomorrow.` - There is a high chance of rain.

- `The meeting is most likely going to be in the afternoon.` - The afternoon is the most probable time.

Sophie is asking James to predict what will probably happen with the deployment process.
