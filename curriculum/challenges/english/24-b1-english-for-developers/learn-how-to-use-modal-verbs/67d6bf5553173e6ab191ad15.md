Sophie decided to start a discussion on the forum to explore possible challenges in the upcoming software release and get insights from others.

`Forum Post: Preparing for Possible Outcomes in Our Next Software Release`

`Hey everyone,`

`We're getting ready for our next software release, and I wanted to discuss some possible outcomes. Ideally, the deployment will go smoothly, but there's always a chance of bugs appearing. If we run into critical issues, we might have to roll back the deployment and fix them before trying again, which could delay the release.`

`Another concern is performance under high traffic. If too many users join at once, our servers could struggle to handle the load. In that case, we may need to scale up quickly to prevent downtime.`

`How do you usually prepare for these situations? Any best practices for reducing bugs before deployment or ensuring server stability? Let's share some insights!`
