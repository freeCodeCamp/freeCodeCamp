<!-- (Audio) Jessica: First, you must update your software tools to the latest versions. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`First, you BLANK BLANK your software tools to the latest versions.`

## --blanks--

`must`

### --feedback--

This modal verb expresses obligation, meaning the action is required.

---

`update`

### --feedback--

This means to modify or refresh something to a new or improved version or state. After `must`, the verb should be in its base form (without `to`).

# --explanation--

`Must` is a modal verb that indicates something is required. In this case, updating the software is mandatory.

`Update` follows `must` in its base form (without `to`). Modal verbs do not use `to` before the main verb.

In the audio, Jessica clearly states what Mark must do, making this the correct structure.
