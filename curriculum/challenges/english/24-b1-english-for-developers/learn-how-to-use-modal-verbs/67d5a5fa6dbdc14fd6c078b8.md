`What happen would if the system crashed?`

The correct word order is `What would happen...`.

`Would what happen if the system crashed?`

### --feedback--

In a question, `would` comes after `what`, not before it.

`What would happens if the system crashed?`

### --feedback--

# --explanation--

If `wh-` question (`when`, `who`, `why`, `how`) uses a modal verb, the modal verb comes before the subject. The main verb stays in its base form. For example:

- `What can you do to fix this?` - Asking about possibilities.

- `Why should we start early?` - Asking for advice.

- `How must we prepare?` - Asking about requirements.

- `When will you finish?` - Asking about future actions.

- `Where could I find help?` - Asking about options.

This way, you're asking about what's possible, necessary, or expected.
