<!-- (audio) Sophie: Well, I'm concerned about the deployment process. It could go smoothly, or we might face some bugs. What do you thing is most likely? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

James isn't sure what is most likely. What would he say?

## --answers--

`It's hard to say.`

---

`We will definitely have a smooth deployment.`

### --feedback--

James is uncertain, so he wouldn't make such a strong prediction.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`It's hard to say` means that something is difficult to predict or uncertain. For example:

- Person 1: `Do you think the project will be finished on time?`

- Person 2: `It's hard to say. It depends on how fast we solve the issues.` - The completion time is uncertain because of possible delays.

James uses this phrase because he doesn't know for sure what will happen, but he suggests possible outcomes.
