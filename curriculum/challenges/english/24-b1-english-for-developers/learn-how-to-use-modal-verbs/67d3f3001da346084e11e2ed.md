# --explanation--

`Compliance` means following rules, laws, or company policies. For example:

- `The company follows compliance rules to protect customer data.` - The company obeys important rules to keep data safe.

- `If a company ignores compliance, it may face legal problems.` - Not following the rules can cause legal trouble for a company.

Jessica says Mark must ensure compliance, meaning she wants him to follow the necessary rules and procedures.
