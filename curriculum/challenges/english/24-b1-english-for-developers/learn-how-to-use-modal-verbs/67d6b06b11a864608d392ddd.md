# --explanation--

`Scale up` means to increase capacity or resources to handle more demand. For example:

- `The company plans to scale up production next year.` - The company wants to increase how much they make in the future.

- `If the app is successful, we can scale up the team.` - If the app does well, we can hire more people to help.

James is suggesting that they increase server capacity so they can handle more users at once.
