# --explanation--

A `bug` is an error, flaw, or problem in software that causes it to work incorrectly. For example:

- `We found some bugs in the new update.` - There are problems in the latest software version.

- `The developer is fixing the bugs in the app.` - The programmer is solving problems in the application.

Sophie is worried that the deployment process might face some bugs, meaning the software could have unexpected errors when released.
