`Could` is used to describe something that is possible but not guaranteed. For example:

- `This bug could cause the app to crash.` - There is a possibility that the app will stop working because of this bug.

- `We could add a new feature to improve user experience.` - Adding a feature is one possible way to make the app better.

James is saying that the servers might get overwhelmed if too many users log in at once.
