# --explanation--

`Multi-factor authentication` is a security feature that requires users to verify their identity in multiple ways before accessing an account.

`Multi-factor` means using multiple pieces of information or steps to verify something. It's like having several layers of protection.

`Authentication` is the process of verifying or confirming someone's identity. It's how systems or websites make sure that you are who you say you are (like when you log in to your account).
