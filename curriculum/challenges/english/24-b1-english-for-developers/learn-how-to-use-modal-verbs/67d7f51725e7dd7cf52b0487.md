## --sentence--

`What I BLANK BLANK out is how they got past our firewall.`

## --blanks--

`can't`

### --feedback--

This is a negative modal verb, meaning `not able to` or `not possible to`.

---

`figure`

### --feedback--

This verb can be used when talking about solving a problem.

# --explanation--

The contraction `can't` is short for `cannot`, which means not able to do something.  

`Can't` (`cannot`) + base verb is used when something is impossible or difficult to understand. For example:

- `I can't believe this happened!` - It is hard for me to believe.

- `She can't access the system.` - She is not able to.

Jake is confused about how the attackers bypassed the firewall, meaning he cannot figure it out.
