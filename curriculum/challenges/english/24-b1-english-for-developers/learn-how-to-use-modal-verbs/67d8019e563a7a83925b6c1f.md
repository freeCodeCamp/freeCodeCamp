# --explanation--

Lisa finds the issue strange because the company's firewall settings are usually solid (strong and secure). A firewall is supposed to block unauthorized access, but in this case, it didn't.  

Lisa is confident that the firewall was not the issue and that the cause of the breach was something else.
