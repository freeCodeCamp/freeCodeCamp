The firewall didn't stop the attack.

---

The firewall was not installed.

### --feedback--

The company already has a firewall.

---

The firewall was too strict and blocked everything.

### --feedback--

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Lisa finds the issue strange because the company's firewall settings are usually solid (strong and secure). A firewall is supposed to block unauthorized access, but in this case, it didn't.  

Lisa is confident that the firewall was not the issue and that the cause of the breach was something else.
