# --explanation--

`Might` is used to talk about possibility — something that could happen but is not certain. For example:

- `It might rain tomorrow.` - There is a chance, but it's not guaranteed.

- `We might need more time to finish the project.` - There is a possibility, but it's not confirmed.
