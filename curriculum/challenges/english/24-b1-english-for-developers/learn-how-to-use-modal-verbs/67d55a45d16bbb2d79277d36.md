<!-- (Audio) Jessica: Besides that, you should run regular security audits. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Besides that, you BLANK BLANK regular security audits.`

## --blanks--

`should`

### --feedback--

This modal verb expresses a recommendation rather than a strict requirement.

---

`run`

### --feedback--

This verb means to carry out or perform an action, like conducting audits.

# --explanation--

Jessica uses `should` to suggest an important action but not make it mandatory. She uses `run` because security audits are performed rather than simply checked or viewed.

Remember, modal verbs are always followed by the base form of the verb (without `to`).
