# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Could someone have left a BLANK open?`

## --blanks--

`port`

### --feedback--

It's a connection point on a network that allows data to flow in and out.  

# --explanation--

A `port` is a virtual connection point used in networking to allow communication between devices. For example:

`I'm trying to connect to the server, but the port might be closed.` - The connection point might be blocked, preventing the connection to the server.

Ports can be `open` or `closed`. An `open port` can allow hackers to enter a system if not properly secured, while a `closed port` does not allow data to pass through it.
