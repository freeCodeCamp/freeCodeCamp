# --explanation--

Jake is analyzing the situation rather than jumping to conclusions.

`It's possible.` means Jake thinks it could have happened, but he is not 100% sure.

`I was checking the logs, and there was a lot of traffic from one particular IP address.` suggests that someone may have been trying to access the system.
