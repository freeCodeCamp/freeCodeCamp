# --explanation--

`Might` is a modal verb that expresses possibility. For example:

- `It might rain tomorrow.` - There is a chance it will rain.

- `She might be late.` - It is possible she will be late.

Sophie is asking about what might happen, meaning she wants to know the possible outcomes if they face problems.
