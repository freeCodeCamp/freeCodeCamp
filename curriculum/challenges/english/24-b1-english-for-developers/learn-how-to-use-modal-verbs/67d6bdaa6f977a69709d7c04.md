Sophie decided to start a discussion on the forum to explore possible challenges in the upcoming software release and get insights from others.

`Forum Post: Preparing for Possible Outcomes in Our Next Software Release`

`Hey everyone,`

`We're getting ready for our next software release, and I wanted to discuss some possible outcomes. Ideally, the deployment will go smoothly, but there's always a chance of bugs appearing. If we run into critical issues, we might have to roll back the deployment and fix them before trying again, which could delay the release.`

`Another concern is performance under high traffic. If too many users join at once, our servers could struggle to handle the load. In that case, we may need to scale up quickly to prevent downtime.`

`How do you usually prepare for these situations? Any best practices for reducing bugs before deployment or ensuring server stability? Let's share some insights!`

Why is high traffic a concern for the software release?

## --answers--

The company won't get enough users.

### --feedback--

Sophie's concern is too much traffic, not too little.

### --feedback--

The concern is not user opinions on features.

Developers will have too many tasks.

### --feedback--

The focus is not on the workload of developers.

Sophie explains that if `too many users join at once`, the servers could struggle to handle the load, leading to performance issues or downtime. This is why high traffic needs to be managed carefully.

Focus on how scalability is crucial for a successful software launch.
