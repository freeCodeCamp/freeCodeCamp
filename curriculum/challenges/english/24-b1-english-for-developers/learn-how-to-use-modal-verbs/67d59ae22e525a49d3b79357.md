# --explanation--

`Could` and `might` are modal verbs used to describe possibilities.

`Could` suggests something is possible but not certain. For example:

`If we don't fix this bug, it could cause a system crash.` - There is a possibility that the system will stop working.

`Might` suggests something is possible but less certain than `could`. For example:

`We might need to rewrite some parts of the code.` - It is possible that changes will be necessary.
