## --answers--

No.

---

Yes.

### --feedback--

Jessica says `should`, which suggests a recommendation, not a strict requirement.

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`Should` is used to suggest or recommend something, but it is not as strong as `must` or `have to`.

Jessica also says `it's not mandatory`, meaning it's not a strict requirement for Mark to run regular security audits. She's simply recommending it because it's a good idea to catch vulnerabilities early, but it's not something he must do.
