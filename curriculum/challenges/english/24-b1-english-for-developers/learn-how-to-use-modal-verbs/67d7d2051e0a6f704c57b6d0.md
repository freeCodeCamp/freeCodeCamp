# --explanation--

A `security breach` refers to an incident where unauthorized access occurs within a system or network.

- `Using weak passwords can lead to a security breach.` - If passwords are not strong, hackers might break into the system.

- `If we don't update the software, there could be a security breach.` - Not updating the software might allow hackers to break in.

In this case, the internal network was compromised.
