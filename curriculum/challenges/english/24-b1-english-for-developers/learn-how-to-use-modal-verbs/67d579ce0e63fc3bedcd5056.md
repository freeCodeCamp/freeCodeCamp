`Outcome` refers to the possible results or consequences of something. For example:

- `We don't know the outcome of the project yet, but we're hopeful.` - We're not sure about the result of the project, but we are optimistic.

- `The outcome of the test showed that the system works as expected.` - The result of the test proved that the system is working correctly.

Sophie talks about the possible outcomes of their software release, meaning they are considering different results or consequences of launching the software.
