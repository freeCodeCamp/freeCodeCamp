# --explanation--

`Idiomatic expressions` are phrases whose meanings are different from the literal meanings of the words. They represent common ways of speaking that often cannot be understood just by looking at each word.  

`Back and forth` is an idiomatic expression meaning a repeated movement or exchange between two points or ideas. In conversation, it means ongoing discussion with different opinions or ideas shared repeatedly. For example:

`There was a lot of back and forth between the team members before deciding on the design.` – This means the team members discussed many times before reaching a decision.
