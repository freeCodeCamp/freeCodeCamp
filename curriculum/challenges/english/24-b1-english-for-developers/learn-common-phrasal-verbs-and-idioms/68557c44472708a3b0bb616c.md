# --explanation--

`Clear` means easy to understand or see. Its comparative form, `clearer`, means easier to understand. For example:

- `The instructions are clear and simple.` – This only emphasizes the simplicity of the instructions without comparing them. 

- `This version of the guide is clearer than the last one.` – This compares the simplicity of two versions, the current and the last one.

`Prominent` means something is easy to notice or stands out. For example:

`The error message should be placed in a prominent position on the screen.` – This means the message should be very visible so users can see it easily.
