# --explanation--

Using `that` after `I think` is optional in sentences like this. Saying `I think that it's vital we make these updates.` is also correct. In everyday conversation, however, it is common to omit `that` for a smoother and quicker sentence. For example: 

`I think that we need more time to finish the project.` – This structure is correct. Most people would say `I think we need more time…`, though.
