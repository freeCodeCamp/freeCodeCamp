# --explanation--

`To engage` means to get someone's attention and interest or to involve them actively. For example:

`The trainer used stories to engage the audience.` – This means the trainer made the audience interested and involved.

`Broader` is the comparative form of `broad`, meaning wider or covering more. For example:

`We need a broader approach that includes more departments.` – This means more than one department will be part of the plan.
