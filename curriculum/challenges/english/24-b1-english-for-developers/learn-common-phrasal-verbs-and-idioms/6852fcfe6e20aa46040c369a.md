# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`That's a good point. BLANK we can simplify it by cutting down BLANK steps.`

## --blanks--

`Perhaps`

### --feedback--

This suggests a possibility. The first letter is capitalized.

---

`unnecessary`

### --feedback--

This describes something that can be removed because it is not needed.

# --explanation--

`Perhaps` means "maybe" or "possibly". It is used when someone is not completely sure but wants to suggest something. For example:

`Perhaps we can try a new tool for project tracking.` – This means the speaker is suggesting the idea as a possibility.

The prefix `un-` is added to adjectives to create the opposite meaning. In `unnecessary`, the base word is `necessary` (meaning needed), and `un-` makes it mean "not needed". Another example:

`It was an unfair decision.` – `Unfair` is the opposite of `fair`, meaning not just or not equal.
