`prepare`

---

`beforehand`

### --feedback--

This means earlier than a particular time or event.

# --explanation--

`To prepare` means to make yourself or something ready for an activity or event. For example:

`We need to prepare the slides before the presentation.` – This means getting everything ready in advance.

`Beforehand` means earlier than a particular event or time. It's used more formally than `before`. While `beforehand` is used as an adverb to describe time in advance of something, `before` can be a preposition or conjunction. For example:
 
- `Please review the agenda beforehand.` – This means the person should check the agenda before the meeting starts.

- `I arrived before the meeting.` – This means the arrival happened earlier. We don't use `beforehand` in this case. When you want to talk about something that happened earlier and say what came after, use `before` instead.
