## --sentence--

`Sophie: Hey Bob, I saw your email about the BLANK webinar on new technology trends. When are we planning to host it?`

`Bob: Hi Sophie, I was thinking we could BLANK it for the last week of this month. Does Thursday the 28th work for you?`

`Sophie: That should work. What time are we considering? I'd suggest late afternoon, maybe around 4 PM, so it doesn't BLANK with other meetings.`

`Bob: Good idea, 4 PM is perfect. It gives us enough time to prepare and wrap up other tasks BLANK. How about we start sending out the invites early next week?`

`Sophie: Sounds good. Should we include a registration link in the invite?`

`Bob: Yes, let's do that. It will help us manage the BLANK list better. Can you draft the invitation? Just include a brief agenda and mention that we'll be discussing the latest trends in BLANK.`

`Sophie: Sure, I'll get that drafted. Do we want to open this up to external participants as well, or is this just for our internal teams?`

`Bob: Let's open it up. It could be a good opportunity to engage with BLANK. We can use the webinar platform to handle external registrations.`

`Sophie: Great, I'll make sure to set that up. I'll send you the draft for approval before we send it out.`
