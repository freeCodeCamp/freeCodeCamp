# --explanation--

`Real-time alerts` are messages or warnings that appear immediately as something happens. For example:

`The app sends real-time alerts if someone logs in from a new location.` – This means every time someone logs in from a different place, the user receives an immediate warning message.

`Graphics` are images or visual elements used to communicate information. For example:

`The dashboard uses graphics to show project progress.` – This means visual tools like charts or icons are used to make data easier to understand.
