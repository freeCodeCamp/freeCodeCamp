# --explanation--

A `warning` is a message or sign that tells you there might be danger or something wrong. For example:

`The system shows a warning when your password is too weak.` – This means a message is shown saying your weak password is unsafe.

Something `suspicious` seems dishonest, dangerous, or unusual in a way that makes you unsure or worried. For example:

`There was suspicious activity in the login history.` – This means something strange or possibly harmful was noticed.
