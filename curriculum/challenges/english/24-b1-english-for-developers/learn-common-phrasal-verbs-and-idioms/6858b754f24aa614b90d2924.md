After talking to Jake, Linda drafts up a list of his suggestions and implementation ideas.

`1. Tooltips and Visual Indicators for Password Strength`

- `Use tooltips or visual elements to show users how strong their password is. We should add a real-time strength meter below the password input, with color coding from red to green and labels like Weak, Moderate, and Strong. Hoverable tooltips or info icons could explain what makes a password stronger — like including numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase letters.`

`2. Custom Security Questions for Password Recovery`

- `Allow users to create their own security questions instead of choosing from a preset list. We could add a "Create your own question" option and guide users with examples or prompts to help them come up with something both secure and memorable. We'll also need to build in some basic checks to avoid overly simple or generic questions.`

`3. Real-Time Alerts for Suspicious Activity`

- `Use urgent, interactive pop-ups with intuitive graphics to alert users. We can design a system where a warning pops up in real time if something unusual happens, like a login from a new device. These alerts should block further action until the user responds, and include strong visuals like warning icons and concise, clear messaging.`

`4. Interactive Quiz for Phishing Awareness`

- `Integrate a short quiz into the onboarding process to teach users how to recognize phishing attempts. This could be a fun, interactive module with real-world scenarios, such as identifying suspicious links in emails. We can add instant feedback for each question and maybe even small rewards or progress tracking to make it engaging.`

What is the risk of using custom security questions, and how does Linda want to manage it?

## --answers--

Users might choose weak questions, so Linda wants to guide them and check their input.

---

Users might forget their questions, so Linda wants to send reminders by email.

### --feedback--

Linda didn't mention reminders or email support for security questions.

---

Users may copy questions from online lists, so Linda wants to block common examples.

### --feedback--

This wasn't mentioned. Linda isn't focused on blocking content.

---

Users could leave the questions blank, so Linda plans to make that field optional.

### --feedback--

Linda isn't thinking of letting users skip the step.
