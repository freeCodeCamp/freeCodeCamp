A `password` is a secret word, phrase, or combination used to access a system, account, or service. For example:

`You should never share your password with anyone.` – This means you are the only one who should know your way to access your system, account, or service.

A `screen` is a page or display in a program or app where users perform actions. For example:

`Click Login to go to the sign-in screen.` – The `sign-in screen` is the page where users enter their login details.
