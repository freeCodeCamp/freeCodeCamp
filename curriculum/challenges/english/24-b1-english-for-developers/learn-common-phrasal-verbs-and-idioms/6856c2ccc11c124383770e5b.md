# --explanation--

`Lastly` is used to introduce the final point in a list or discussion. For example:

`Lastly, let's review the budget changes.` – This means it's the last item to talk about.

`Any thoughts on...` is an informal way of asking for someone's ideas or opinions. It often omits the full phrase `Do you have any thoughts on...` in the beginning. For example:

`Any thoughts on how we can improve this layout?` – This means the speaker is asking for ideas in a friendly and casual way about how to make a layout better.
