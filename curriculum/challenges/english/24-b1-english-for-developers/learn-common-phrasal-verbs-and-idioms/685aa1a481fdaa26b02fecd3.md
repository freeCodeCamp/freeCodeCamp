# --explanation--

A `participant` is a person who takes part in an event, activity, or meeting. For example:

`Each participant in the workshop received a certificate.` – This means everyone who joined the workshop got a certificate.

`Internal` is related to things within a company or organization. It's the opposite of `external`. For example:

`This event is for internal employees only. It's not for external partners and clients.` – This means only people in the company should attend this event.
People from outside the company are not supposed to join.
