# --explanation--

A `draft` is an early version of a document or plan that can be edited or reviewed. For example:

`I wrote a draft of the email before sending the final version.` – This means the person wrote an early version of the email.

`To run something by someone` is to show or explain something to someone for feedback or approval. For example:

`Can I run this idea by you before we present it?` – This means I am asking for your opinion about it.

`To roll something out` is to officially launch or introduce something to a wider group. For example:

`They will roll out the new software update next week.` – This means the new version of the software will be released next week.

The suffix `-wide` means "across the whole" of something. In `company-wide`, it means something that applies to the entire company. Another example:

`There was a system-wide outage yesterday.` – This means the issue affected the entire system.
