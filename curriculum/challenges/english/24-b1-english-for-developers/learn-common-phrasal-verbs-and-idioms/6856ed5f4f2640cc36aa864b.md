# --explanation--

`To make a difference` means to cause a change or improvement in a situation. For example:

`Using strong passwords can make a big difference in your online safety.` – This means that the impact of strong passwords to security is significant.

`Securely` means in a safe and protected way. For example:

`Make sure to log out securely after using a public computer.` – This means you should always log out in a way that keeps your information safe.
