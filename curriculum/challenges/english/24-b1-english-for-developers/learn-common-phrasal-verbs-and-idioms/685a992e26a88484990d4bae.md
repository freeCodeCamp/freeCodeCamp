<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Bob answer Sophie's question to support her idea?

## --answers--

`I don't think that's necessary.`

### --feedback--

That would disagree with Sophie's idea, not support it.

---

`Yes, let's do that.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`Let's do that` is a casual way to agree with and support someone's idea. It shows you think it's a good idea and you're ready to take action. For example:

- Person 1: `Should we order pizza for lunch?` – This person suggests the menu for lunch.

- Person 2: `Yes, let's do that.` – This means the speaker agrees and wants to follow through with the suggestion.
