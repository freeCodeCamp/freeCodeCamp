# --explanation--

The structure `help` + `to` + verb is used to show that someone supports or assists in doing something. It is also correct to say `help` + verb without `to` (e.g., `help make`). Another example: 

`He helped to fix the code.` or `He helped fix the code.` â€“ Both mean he gave support in solving the problem.
