# --explanation--

There are two common ways to form comparatives. Choose the form based on how many syllables the adjective has.

- For most **1-syllable adjectives**, add `-er` at the end. For example:

`This explanation is much clearer than the other one.` – The `-er` ending is used because `clear` is a short adjective with only one syllable.

- For **longer adjectives** (2+ syllables), use `more` + adjective. For example:

`Ah, now the button looks more prominent. Users can't miss it.` – `More` is used preceding the adjective because `prominent` has three syllables and is too long for the `-er` form.

Other examples:

- `This bedroom is smaller than ours at home.` – `Small` is a 1-syllable adjective, so the `-er` form, `smaller`, is used.

- `I think cell phones are more useful than tablets.` – `Useful` is a 2-syllable adjective, so you don't add `-er` in the end, but preceed it with `more` instead (`more prominent`).
