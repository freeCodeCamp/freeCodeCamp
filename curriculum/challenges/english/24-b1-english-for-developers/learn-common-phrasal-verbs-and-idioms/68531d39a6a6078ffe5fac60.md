# --explanation--

`While we're at it` means doing something because you're already involved in a related activity. For example:

`While we're at it, let's also clean the kitchen.` – This means since you're already doing something (like organizing), you should add another similar task.

`To wrap up` means to finish or complete something. For example:

`Let's wrap up this meeting in the next five minutes.` – This means the speaker wants to bring the meeting to a close.
