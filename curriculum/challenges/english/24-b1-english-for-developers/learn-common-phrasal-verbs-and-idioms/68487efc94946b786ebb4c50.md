# --explanation--

`Model`​ refers to a structured framework or system that shows how something is organized or operates.

Here, Brian is talking about their `​work model​`, which defines how a company organizes its work, like remote, hybrid, or in-office setups. Another example:

`Our new work model allows people to work from home three days a week.` – This means the company has a structure that supports partial remote work.
