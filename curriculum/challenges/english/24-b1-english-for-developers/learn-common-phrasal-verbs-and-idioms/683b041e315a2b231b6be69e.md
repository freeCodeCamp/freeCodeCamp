# --explanation--

**Phrasal verbs** are combinations of verbs and one or more prepositions or adverbs, which, combined, produce a meaning that might be partly or completely different from the original meaning of the verb. Using these expressions helps users in conversation express meaning in an informal way and convey what they mean efficiently.

`To hash out` is a **phrasal verb** meaning to discuss something thoroughly in order to come to an agreement. For example: 

`Let's hash out the budget before the meeting.` – This means the discussion about how to plan expenses should be made before the meeting happens.

A `policy` is a rule or guideline used by a group or organization. A `remote work policy`, for instance, would be the set of rules about working at any place outside the office. For example:

`The company has a strict policy on data security.` – This means the company has a very rigid set of rules concerning how their data is dealt with.
