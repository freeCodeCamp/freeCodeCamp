# --explanation--

Using expressions like `early morning`, `late afternoon`, or `early evening` helps specify an approximate time. Business hours are typically `9 a.m.` to `5 p.m.`, so scheduling something for `late afternoon` (like `4 p.m.`) can help avoid conflicts with other meetings or tasks. Another example:

`Let's meet in the early afternoon, around 1 p.m., after lunch.` â€“ This shows the meeting is planned to avoid both the morning rush and late-day conflicts.
