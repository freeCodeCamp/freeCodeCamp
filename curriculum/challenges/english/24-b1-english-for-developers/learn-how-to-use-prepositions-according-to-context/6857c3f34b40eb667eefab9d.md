`Out of the way` means something is located in a place that's not easy to reach or not commonly used. For example:

`The printer is out of the way in a corner.` – This means it's in an inconvenient location.

`Server room` is a special area where computer servers and network equipment are kept. For example:

`Only IT staff can enter the server room.` – This shows it's a technical and secure space.
