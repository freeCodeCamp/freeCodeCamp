Maria follows up with David by sending her first weekly update:

`Hi David,`

`As promised, here's a quick update on our progress this week.`

`We've started to allocate additional resources in preparation for the next milestone. So far, we've confirmed five more developers and are in the process of onboarding two new designers to support the upcoming user interface work.`

`For testing, we've outlined a plan to double the size of our testing team around mid-quarter. This should help us meet our goals without risking delays, especially after the unexpected challenges we faced last time.`

`On the project management side, Sarah has stepped in as the leader. She's getting up to speed quickly and has already started organizing the schedule and daily tasks.`

`I'll also prepare a more detailed budget review early next week. It will reflect the current timeline, staff increase, and tool requirements. Everything is still on track to meet the end-of-quarter deadline.`

`Let me know if you'd like to adjust anything.`

`Best,`

`Maria`
