# --explanation--

`Tasks planned` refers to jobs or responsibilities that are already decided and expected to be done. For example:  

`The tasks planned for next week include testing and debugging.` – This shows what is scheduled.

`Two more` combines a number with `more` to show an increase in quantity. In resource discussions, this is a common way to talk about how many additional people or items are needed. For example:

`We need two more developers to finish the sprint.` – This means two extra team members are required to meet the goal.

`Sufficient` means enough to meet a requirement. For example:  

`One hour should be sufficient for the meeting.` – This means one hour is likely enough.
