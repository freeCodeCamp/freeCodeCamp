## --sentence--

`Sarah: Good morning, James. I heard you're setting up your new workstation today. Need help finding anything?`

`James: Hi Sarah, yes, that would be great. I'm trying to find an extra monitor. Do you know where they've moved them?`

`Sarah: Sure, they've placed them BLANK the IT room now. If you head BLANK down this corridor and turn left at the break area, you'll see them stored right across from the coffee machine.`

`James: Got it. And what about the new keyboards? I heard we received a shipment last week.`

`Sarah: Yes, they're in a small storage room. Go back BLANK the main entrance, but before you get there, BLANK. It's the second door on your left, opposite the mail room.`

`James: Perfect, thanks! Lastly, I need some Ethernet cables. Any idea where those ended up?`

`Sarah: Actually, yes. They are a bit BLANK â€” go to the server room, but instead of going BLANK, turn right just before the door. There's a closet there where we're keeping all cables and related accessories.`

`James: That's a bit of a trek! Thanks for helping me, Sarah!`
