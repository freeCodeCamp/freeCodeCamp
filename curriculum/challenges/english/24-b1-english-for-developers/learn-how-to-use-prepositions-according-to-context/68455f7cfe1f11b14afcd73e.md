`Draft` is an early version of a document. For example:  

`She wrote the first draft of the proposal.` – It can still be edited.

`Send it over` means to deliver something. For example:  

`I'll send it over once it's ready.` – It means sharing a file or message.

`To` shows who the action is for. For example:  

`She gave the file to her manager.` – It shows who receives it.
