## --sentence--

`Anna: Good morning, Bob. Have you seen the layout plan for our new office? I need your input BLANK where to place each department.`

`Bob: Yes, I've looked BLANK the plans. Let's start with the IT department. I think it should be next to the server room for easy access.`

`Anna: That makes sense. The server room is in the back, right?`

`Bob: Exactly, it's in the back, BLANK the emergency exit. Now, where do you think we should put the HR department?`

`Anna: HR should be near the entrance. It's easier for visitors and new employees to find us. How about the space right BLANK from the reception?`

`Bob: Sounds good, that's very accessible. And the marketing team? They need a quiet area but also want to be close to the sales department.`

`Anna: There's an area BLANK side of the building, right next to the sales office. It's a bit isolated from the main walkways, so it should be quieter.`

`Bob: Perfect. Let's put them there. What about the customer support team?`

`Anna: Let's place them near the middle of the floor. They need to be easily reachable. Maybe right BLANK the conference rooms?`

`Bob: That works. They'll be BLANK, but the conference rooms will buffer some of the noise. Last, where should we set up the break room?`

`Anna: It should be centrally located so it’s equally accessible to everyone. How about between the IT department and HR? That way, it’s just a short walk for most teams.`

`Bob: I agree, that’s a convenient spot for everyone. Thanks, Anna. I’ll update the layout draft with these changes and send it over to you for your final review.`

`Anna: Thanks, Bob. I’ll look out for that and we can discuss it further if there are any tweaks needed.`
