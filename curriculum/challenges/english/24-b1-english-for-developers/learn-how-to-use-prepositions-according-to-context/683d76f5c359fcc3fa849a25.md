It needs more signs and directions.

### --feedback--

Bob says it's already `accessible`, so he doesn't think signs are a problem.

It should be limited to employees only.

`Accessible` suggests openness and ease of entry, not restriction.

It's too far from the main entrance.

If it was far, Bob wouldn't call it `very accessible`.
