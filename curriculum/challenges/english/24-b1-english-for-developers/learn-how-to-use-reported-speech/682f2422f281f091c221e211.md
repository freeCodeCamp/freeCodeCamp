# --explanation--

`To maintain` means to keep something working correctly or in good condition. For example:

`We maintain the server by checking it regularly.` – This means we take care of it so it keeps working well.

A `vulnerability` is a weakness in a system that could be attacked or used to cause harm. For example:

`The old version of the app had a security vulnerability.` – This means it had a weak point that hackers could use.
