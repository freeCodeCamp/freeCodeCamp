A `phishing attack` is when a fake message (like an email or a message on a website) tries to trick people into sharing private information, such as passwords or credit card numbers. For example:

`The team received a phishing email that looked like it was from IT support asking for login details` – This means someone tried to steal information by pretending to be someone else.
