`It seems like if we had monitored the system load more closely, we could have BLANK the BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`prevented`

### --feedback--

---

`overload`

### --feedback--

This means having too much of something, causing a system or part to fail.

# --explanation--

`To prevent` means to take action that stops something bad or unwanted from happening. For example:

`We installed a firewall to prevent unauthorized access.` – This means the firewall stops unwanted users from entering the system.

An `overload` is when a system or device is given more work, data, or power than it can handle, causing problems. For example:

`The power outage was caused by an overload in the electrical grid.` – This means too much electricity caused a failure.
