# --explanation--

In `reported speech`, `to explain` is used when someone gives a reason or makes something clear. For example:

- Direct speech: `The server went down because of a power issue.`

- Reported speech: `She explained that the server went down due to a power issue.`

A `system component` is a part or piece of a larger system, usually in computers or networks. For example:

`The login module is a key system component for user access` – This means it is one of the essential parts of the system.
