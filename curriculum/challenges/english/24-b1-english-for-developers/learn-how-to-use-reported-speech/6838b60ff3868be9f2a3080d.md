# --explanation--

`To spread` means to arrange or distribute things over a space or period. For example:

`They spread the workload among all team members.` – This means the work was shared fairly.

`Evenly` means something is done in a balanced or equal manner. For example:

`The paint was applied evenly to avoid streaks.` – This means the paint covered the surface smoothly and equally.

`To fail` means to stop working properly or not to achieve the desired result. For example:

`The system failed during the update, causing a delay.` – This means it stopped working correctly at that time.
