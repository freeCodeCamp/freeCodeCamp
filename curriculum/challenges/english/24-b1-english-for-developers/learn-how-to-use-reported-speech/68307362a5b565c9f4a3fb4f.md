# --explanation--

`It was mentioned...` is also a structure in the **passive voice**, where the focus is on the idea being shared, not on who said it. For example:

`It was mentioned that the update improved security.` – This tells you the idea without naming the speaker.

The structure `it's` + comparative adjective + `to` + verb is used to show how something is done in contrast with something else. For example:

`It's faster to search with the new tool.` – This means the new tool saves time when searching in comparison to the old tool.
