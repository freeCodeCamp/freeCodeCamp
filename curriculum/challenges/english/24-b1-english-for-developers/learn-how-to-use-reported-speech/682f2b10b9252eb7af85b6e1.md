# --explanation--

`To address a point` means to talk about or deal with a specific topic, question, or concern. For example:

`During the review, she addressed the issue of late submissions.` – This means she talked about and responded to that problem.

A `workshop` is a training event or session where people actively learn about or practice something. For example:

`The team attended a cybersecurity workshop to learn how to recognize phishing attacks.` – This means they joined a session focused on improving their knowledge.
