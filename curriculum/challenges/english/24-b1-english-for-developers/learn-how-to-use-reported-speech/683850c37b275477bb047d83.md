# --explanation--

A `log` is a record of events, actions, or messages created by a computer system or software. For example:

`The system logs showed several errors before the crash.` – This means the records had information about problems that occurred.

A `crash` is when a computer system or program suddenly stops working properly. For example:

`The application crash caused all unsaved data to be lost.` – This means the program failed unexpectedly, and data was not saved.
