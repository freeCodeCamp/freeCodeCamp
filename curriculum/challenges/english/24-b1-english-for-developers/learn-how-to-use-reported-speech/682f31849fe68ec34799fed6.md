`Sophie: Hi Brian, I just spoke with Jake about the security breach we had last week. He told me we experienced a BLANK attack that targeted several team members.`

`Brian: That sounds serious. What did Jake say?`

`Sophie: He said that the team responded quickly once the breach was detected. Jake mentioned that they managed to isolate the affected systems BLANK minutes, which limited the damage.`

`Brian: Good to hear they contained it quickly. Did Jake give any feedback on how we can prevent similar BLANK in the future?`

`Brian: That's an important point. We should definitely incorporate that feedback into our next training session. Can you write up a BLANK of this discussion? I'd like to use it to update our training materials.`
