`Sophie: He said that the team responded quickly once the breach was detected. Jake mentioned that they managed to isolate the affected systems BLANK minutes, which limited the damage.`

`Brian: Good to hear they contained it quickly. Did Jake give any feedback on how we can prevent similar BLANK in the future?`
