<!-- (Audio) Lisa: It seems like if we had monitored the system load more closely, we could have prevented the overload. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What can we understand from Lisa's comment?

## --answers--

The overload was caused by hardware failure.

### --feedback--

Lisa doesn't talk about hardware problems.

---

They monitored the system load perfectly.

### --feedback--

The structure Lisa uses refers to a hypothetical past. It didn't actually happen.

---

There was no overload at all.

### --feedback--

Lisa mentions a preventable event.

---

The system load probably happened because of lack of monitoring.

# --explanation--

The `Past Perfect` tense (`had` + verb in the `past participle` form) is used to talk about an action that happened before another past event. It shows which action happened first. For example:

`The server had crashed before the backup started.` – The crash happened first, then the backup started.

The `Third Conditional` structure (`if` + verb in the `past perfect` as the hypothetical cause, modal verb + `have` + verb in the `past participle` form as the hypothetical consequence) expresses an unreal past condition and its possible, but unreal result. It talks about how things could be different if other courses of action were taken. For example:

`If they had updated the software, they could have avoided the error.` – This means the update didn't happen, and the error was not avoided.
