# --explanation--

`To seem` is used when something appears to be true based on what we know, but we're not completely certain. For example:

`It seems the users liked the new menu` – This means you think the users liked it, based on the feedback or behavior, but you are not sure of it.

`To be found to be` is a `passive voice` structure used when someone finds, discovers or concludes something, but the focus is on the result, not who made the judgment. For example:

`The layout was found to be confusing by some testers` – This means testers thought it was confusing, but the sentence emphasizes the finding, not the people (in this case, the testers).
