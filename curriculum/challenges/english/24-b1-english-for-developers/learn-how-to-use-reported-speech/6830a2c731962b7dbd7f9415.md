# --explanation--

`User-friendly` means something is simple, easy to use, and doesn't require much effort to understand. It's often used to describe software, websites, or forms that are designed with the user in mind. For example:

`The new dashboard is much more user-friendly than the old one.` â€“ This means people find it easier and more pleasant to use.
