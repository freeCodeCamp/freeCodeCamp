# --explanation--

`Some of the` is used to talk about a specific part of a larger, known group. It's more precise than just saying `some`, which is general and undefined.
For example:

`Some of the suggestions were really useful` – This means a few specific suggestions from a larger set were useful.

In contrast, if you say `Some suggestions were useful`, it offers a more general idea and it doesn't refer to a known set.
