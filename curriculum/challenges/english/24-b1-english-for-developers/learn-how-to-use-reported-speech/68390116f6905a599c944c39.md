# --explanation--

`If only` is used at the beginning of a sentence to express a wish or regret about something that didn't happen in the past. It shows that the speaker wishes the situation had been different. For example:

`If only we had checked the system earlier, we could have avoided the crash.` â€“ This means they didn't check early enough and now regret it.
