# --explanation--

`Unusually` is an adverb used to describe something that happens more or less than what is normal or expected. On the other hand, `unusual` is an adjective that describes something that is not common or normal. For example:

- `The server experienced an unusually high load today.` – In this sentence, `unusually` relates to how high the load was (far beyond the normal).  

- `It was unusual for the server to slow down like that.` – In this sentence, `unusual` refers to the situation. It does not modify a verb or an adjective.

A `query` is a question or request sent to a database to get information or perform an action. For example:

`The application sent a query to the database to fetch user details.` – This means the app asked the database for specific information.
