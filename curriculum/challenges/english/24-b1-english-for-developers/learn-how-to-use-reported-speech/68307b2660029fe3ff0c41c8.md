# --explanation--

A `layout` is the way information or elements are arranged on a page or screen. For example:

`The homepage layout was redesigned to highlight key services.` – This means the structure was changed to make services easier to see.

`Faster` is the comparative form of `fast`, meaning something happens more quickly than before. For example:

`The system now loads faster after the update.` – This means it takes less time to open or process.
