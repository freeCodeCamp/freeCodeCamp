## --sentence--

`Hi, Brian. I just spoke with Jake about the security BLANK we had last week.`

## --blanks--

`breach`

### --feedback--

Preceded by `security`, this means a failure in a system or protection, often used when someone breaks into a secure place or data.

# --explanation--

A `security breach` happens when someone got past protection or security, usually by hacking or entering without permission. For example:

`The company reported a major security breach after hackers accessed customer data` – This means someone entered the company's protected system and saw information they shouldn't have.
