# --questions--

## --text--

What could Mark say to show he agrees with Lisa's idea?

## --answers--

`I was thinking the same thing.`

---

`We need to investigate more.`

### --feedback--

This does not express agreement with Lisa's comment.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

The `Past Continuous` tense (`was/were` + verb in the `-ing` form) is used here to describe an action or thought happening over a period of time in the past, often simultaneously with another event. It can show that someone was already thinking about the same idea. For example:

`I was reading the report when you called.` â€“ This means the action of reading was ongoing when the call happened.

In this case, `I was thinking the same thing` means Mark's idea happened during or before Lisa's comment and shows agreement.
