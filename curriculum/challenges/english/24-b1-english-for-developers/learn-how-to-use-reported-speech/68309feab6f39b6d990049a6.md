<!-- (Audio) Tom: Were the changes in the contact page noticed? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which of the following could Linda say to answer positively?

## --answers--

`They were.`

---

`They aren't.`

### --feedback--

This is present tense and negative. It doesn't match the question.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

When answering a `yes`/`no` question, you can reply with a short affirmative sentence using only the subject and auxiliary verb — without saying `Yes` at the beginning. It still clearly confirms the action. For example:

- Person 1: `Was the report submitted on time?` - This person is asking about the handing in of a report. 

- Person 2:`It was.` – This is a full, polite affirmative response without the need of starting with `Yes`.
