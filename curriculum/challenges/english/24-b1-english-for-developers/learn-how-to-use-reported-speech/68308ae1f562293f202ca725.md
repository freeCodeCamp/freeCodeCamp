# --explanation--

When you say `it could be toned down a bit`, you're using a `passive voice` construction with a `modal verb`. It focuses on the action and what should happen, not who should do it. The active voice version would be `The designers could tone down the color scheme a bit.`. This clearly names who should take action. Another example:

- `Passive voice`: `The notification sound could be lowered` – This focuses on the sound, not the person making the change.

- `Active voice`: `You could lower the notification sound.` – This tells who is responsible for the action.
