# --explanation--

`The additional contact options were highlighted...` is a structure in the **passive voice**. It means someone pointed out the contact options as a great improvement, but you don't say who did it (as it is already clear you are talking about the users and their feedback). The focus is on the action and the feature itself. Another example:

`The security updates were highlighted in the weekly report.` â€“ This means the report pointed them out, but you don't focus on who wrote it.
