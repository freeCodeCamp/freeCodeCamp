# --explanation--

The `Third Conditional` is used to talk about unreal situations in the past — things that did not happen — and their possible results. Its structure is `If` + `past perfect`, modal (`could/might/should`) + `have` + `past participle`. Using this conditional means that the action in the `if` clause did not happen, and the result did not occur, but you imagine it was a possible outcome. For example:

`If we had tested the system earlier, we might have prevented the failure.` – This means testing was not done, and failure happened, but if it had been done, the failure might have been avoided.
