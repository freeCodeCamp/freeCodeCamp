`patches`

`exploited`

This means taken advantage of, often in a negative or harmful way. Use the regular past participle form of the verb.

# --explanation--

A `patch` is a small update released by software developers to fix problems, improve performance, or fix security issues. For example:

`The company released a patch to fix the login error` – This means they published a fix for the problem.

`To exploit` means to use something in a way that is unfair or causes harm, especially by taking advantage of a weakness. For example:

`Hackers exploited a flaw in the email server` – This means they used the weakness to gain access or cause damage.
