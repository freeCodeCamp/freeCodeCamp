## --sentence--

`If the latest BLANK had been applied, they might have addressed some of the vulnerabilities that were BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`patches`

### --feedback--

This refers to software updates designed to fix bugs or security issues. Use the plural form.

---

`exploited`

### --feedback--

This means taken advantage of, often in a negative or harmful way. It ends in `-ed`.

# --explanation--

A `patch` is a small update released by software developers to fix problems, improve performance, or fix security issues. For example:

`The company released a patch to fix the login error.` – This means they published a fix for the problem.

`To exploit` means to use something in a way that is unfair or causes harm, especially by taking advantage of a weakness. For example:

`Hackers exploited a flaw in the email server.` – This means they used the weakness to gain access or cause damage.
