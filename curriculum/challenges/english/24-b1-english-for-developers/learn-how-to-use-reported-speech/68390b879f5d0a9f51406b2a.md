## --sentence--

`Lisa: Hey Mark, I've been reviewing the logs from last week's BLANK. It seems like if we had monitored the system load more closely, we could have prevented the BLANK.`

`Mark: That's true. The logs showed that the database was receiving an unusually high number of queries before it crashed. Had we spread these queries more evenly, BLANK the system wouldn't have failed.`

`Lisa: Exactly. Also, I noticed we hadn't updated our BLANK in a while. If the latest patches had been applied, they might have addressed some of the vulnerabilities that were exploited.`

`Mark: I was thinking the same thing. If only we had BLANK the update, we might not have faced this issue. It's frustrating that we realized its importance too late.`

`Lisa: It's a tough lesson, but a BLANK one. Going forward, how can we ensure this doesn't happen again? We need a more BLANK maintenance strategy.`
