# --explanation--

`Was there` is the interrogative (question) form of `There was`, which is used to ask if something existed or happened in the past. It inverts the subject and verb to form a question. For example:

- `There was a problem with the layout.` (statement - you are saying a problem happened)  

- `Was there a problem with the layout?` (question - you are asking if a problem happened)

This helps ask about the presence or occurrence of something in the past.
