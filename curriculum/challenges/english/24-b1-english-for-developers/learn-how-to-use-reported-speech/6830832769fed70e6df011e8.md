# --explanation--

`To bring up` means to mention or introduce a topic in conversation. The past form of the verb is the irregular form `brought`. For example:

`She brought up the budget during the meeting.` – This means she introduced the topic of the budget.

The structure `was brought up` is in the **passive voice**. It means someone mentioned the topic, but you don't say who mentioned it. The focus is on the action, not the person. For example:

`The issue was brought up by several users.` – This means users mentioned the issue, but the focus is on the issue itself.
