# --explanation--

In `reported speech`, `to suggest` is used to share advice or ideas that someone gave. For example:  

- Direct Speech: `I think we should update our firewall.`

- Reported Speech: `Jake suggested updating the firewall.`

This shows that someone gave advice or a possible solution without using their exact words.
