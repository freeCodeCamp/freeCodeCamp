# --explanation--

`Of course` is a polite way to show agreement or say `yes` without hesitation. It means the speaker is happy or willing to do something. For example:

`Of course, I'll help you with the report.` – This means the speaker is glad to help.

`Will` is often used to make promises or express a decision at the moment of speaking. For example:

`I'll email you the file this afternoon.` – This shows a promise to do something soon.
