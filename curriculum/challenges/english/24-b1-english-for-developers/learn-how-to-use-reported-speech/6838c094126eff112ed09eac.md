# --explanation--

`To notice` means to become aware of something by observing or paying attention. For example:

`I noticed a typo in the report before submitting it` – This means the person saw the mistake.

The `Past Perfect` tense (`had` + verb in the `past participle` form) is used to talk about an action that happened before another past action or moment. It shows the earlier event. For example:

`She had already left when the meeting started.` – Leaving happened before the meeting began.
