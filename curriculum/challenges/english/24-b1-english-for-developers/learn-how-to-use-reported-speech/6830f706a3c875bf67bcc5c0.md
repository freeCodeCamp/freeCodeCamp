# --explanation--

`How about` is used to ask for someone's opinion or status of something, especially after another topic has just been discussed. It's often used to smoothly move to a related subject. For example:

`We've reviewed the layout. How about the color choices?` â€“ This means the speaker now wants to know what the other person thinks about the colors.
