# --explanation--

The structures that combine the verb `to be` in the `Simple Past` and verbs in the `Past Participle` form (`were well received` and `was mentioned`) are both in the **passive voice**. In these structures, the focus is on the action or result, not on the person doing it. Another example:

`The update was released last week.` â€“ This focuses on the event (the release), not on who did it.
