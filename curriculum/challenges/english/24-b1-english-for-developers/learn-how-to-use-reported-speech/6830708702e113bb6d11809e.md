# --explanation--

This sentence uses the **passive voice**, which focuses on the object receiving the action instead of who is doing it. For example:  

`The navigation menu was appreciated.` – This means people liked it, but it doesn't say who liked it.  

In the **active voice**, you would say `The users appreciated the navigation menu.` – This clearly shows who did the action.

The **passive voice** is often used when the person doing the action is unknown or not important. Another example:

`The report was completed on time.` – You know the report is done, but you don't know or need to say who completed it.
