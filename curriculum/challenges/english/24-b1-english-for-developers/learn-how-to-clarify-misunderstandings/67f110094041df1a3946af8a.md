## --text--

After speaking with Mark, Lisa discovered that the problem was affecting the whole team, so she wrote a memo to inform everyone.

`Hi team,`

`Just a quick update: I spoke with Mark about a glitching issue in the menu—it sometimes disappears or shows the wrong options and acts weird. We also noticed flickering when switching tabs. The behavior is not consistent, but it happens enough to be a problem.`

`After checking a few machines, I confirmed it's happening across the team. It looks like a graphics driver or rendering problem, possibly linked to event handling in the UI framework.`

`Please update your graphics drivers as soon as possible. If the issue continues, we'll run further diagnostics.`

`Let me know if you have questions.`

`— Lisa`
