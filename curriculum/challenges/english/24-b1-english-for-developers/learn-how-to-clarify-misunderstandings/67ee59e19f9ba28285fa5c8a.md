# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Does it happen BLANK you click, or just BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`every time`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means something happens on all occasions without exception.

---

`sometimes`

### --feedback--

This means something happens occasionally, but not always.

# --explanation--

`Every time` means that something happens consistently, without fail, on each occasion. For example:

`The light turns on every time you press the button` – This means it always happens when you press the button.

`Sometimes` means that something happens occasionally, but not consistently. For example:

`The light flickers sometimes when you press the button` – This means it doesn't always happen; it happens now and then.

The contrast between `every time` and `sometimes` shows the difference between things happening all the time and things happening only occasionally.
