<!-- (Audio) Mark: Thanks for clarifying. And "abstraction"? Does it mean simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details? -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is Mark trying to confirm about "abstraction"?

## --answers--

If it means showing all the technical details of a system.

### --feedback--

This is the opposite of abstraction.

---

If it means simplifying a system by hiding the parts users don’t need to see.

---

If it means copying code from one part of a program to another.

### --feedback--

Mark isn’t talking about duplicating code. He’s asking about hiding complexity, not repeating code.

---

If it means deleting parts of a system to make it smaller.

### --feedback--

Abstraction is not about deleting parts.

# --explanation--

Mark asks whether abstraction is about hiding unnecessary details to simplify complex systems. This is exactly what abstraction does in programming - it allows developers to focus on what matters while ignoring lower-level complexity. For example, when using a function like `print()`, you don’t need to know how it works internally—you just use it. That’s abstraction. It keeps systems clean, usable, and easier to manage.

# --explanation--

`Simplifying complex systems` means making something large or difficult easier to use or think about.

`Hiding unnecessary details` means keeping internal parts (like how something works) hidden from the user, so they only see what they need to interact with.

Mark’s question shows that he understands abstraction as a way to manage complexity — not by deleting parts, but by organizing systems so that users only deal with what’s relevant.
