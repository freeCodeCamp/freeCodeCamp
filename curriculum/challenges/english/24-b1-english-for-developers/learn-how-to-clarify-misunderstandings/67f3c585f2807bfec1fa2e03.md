After their conversation, Jessica followed up with an email to confirm the project details and share the updated timeline:

`Hi David,`

`As promised, here's the updated project timeline for the finance app, including more detail on where things stand:`

`April 8–9: Final bug fixes focused on minor user interface glitches discovered after main testing.`

`April 10: Quick round of regression testing to confirm all issues are resolved and nothing new has appeared.`

`April 11: Release preparation — packaging the build, updating documentation, and internal review.`

`April 12: App launch as planned.`

`We're still on schedule, and no major blockers have come up. Just to clarify, all core features are stable and performing well. The budget tracking feature is confirmed for the next release, which we're planning for later this month. I'll follow up soon with that timeline once it's finalized.`

`Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to go over.`

`Thanks,`

`Jessica`
