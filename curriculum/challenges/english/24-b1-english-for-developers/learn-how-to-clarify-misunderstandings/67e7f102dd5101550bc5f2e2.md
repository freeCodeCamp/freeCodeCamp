# --explanation--

`Inheritance` is a key concept in object-oriented programming where a new class (called the subclass or child class) derives properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (called the parent class). This allows the child class to reuse code from the parent class, making it easier to manage and extend the functionality. For example:

`In Java, inheritance allows one class to inherit the methods and attributes of another class.` - This is a fundamental principle of code reuse and organization.

`Does it mean` is used to ask for clarification about the definition or meaning of something. For example:

`Does it mean we need to update the system before we deploy the new features?` - Here, `does it mean` is used to ask for clarification about whether a specific action is required.

`Passing down` refers to transferring something from one entity or place to another. For example:

`The company's coding standards are passed down from senior developers to the new team members.` - This means transferring knowledge or standards from one group to another.
