# --explanation--

`Not that I know of` is used to say that, as far as you are aware, something is not true or hasn’t happened. It's often used to politely say `no` while leaving room for the possibility that the speaker could be wrong. For example:

Person 1: `Has the update been installed?`

Person 2：`Not that I know of.`

This means "I don’t believe it has, but I’m not completely sure."
