# --explanation--

`Not that I know of` is used to say that, as far as you are aware, something is not true or hasn't happened. It's often used to politely say `no` while leaving room for the possibility that the speaker could be wrong. For example:

- Person 1: `Has the update been installed?`

- Person 2ï¼š`Not that I know of.` - This means you don't believe the update has been installed, but you're not completely sure.
