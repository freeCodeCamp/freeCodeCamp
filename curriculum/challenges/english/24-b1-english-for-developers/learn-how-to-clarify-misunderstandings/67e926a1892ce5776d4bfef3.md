<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Yes, that's correct. "Abstraction" is about reducing complexity by showing only what's necessary, keeping the details hidden. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

According to Sophie, what best describes the purpose of abstraction?

## --answers--

To reduce complexity by showing only what's needed and hiding the rest.

---

To duplicate important code so that it's visible everywhere.

### --feedback--

Sophie talks about reducing complexity, not making everything visible or duplicating code.

---

To combine all system components into one large class.

### --feedback--

Abstraction is about simplifying, not merging everything into one place.

---

To let users control all internal parts of a program directly.

### --feedback--

Sophie says abstraction hides internal details - not gives full access to them.

# --explanation--

`Reducing complexity` means making a system easier to understand and work with.
  
`Showing only what's necessary` means that the user only sees the parts they need to interact with.
  
`Keeping the details hidden` refers to hiding internal code or logic that isn't needed by the user.

Together, this means abstraction creates a clear, simple interface while hiding the more complex inner workings behind the scenes.
