## --text--

After his conversation with Sophie, Mark decided to write to his mentor David to reflect on what he had learned.

`Hi David,`

`I just wanted to share a quick update. After sitting in on a recent code review, I finally feel like I'm starting to understand some key programming concepts.`

`Sophie explained terms like polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. For example, I saw how encapsulation helps with keeping details hidden and making the code easier to work with. I also noticed polymorphism in a method that changes behavior depending on the input.`

`I tried writing a small class using these ideas — focusing on clean code structure, reusing properties and methods, and simplifying functionality.`

`Does it mean I'm on the right track if I can explain these terms and apply them in a simple project?`

`Thanks for explaining these things over time. I appreciate the explanations and all your support.`

`Best,`

`Mark`
