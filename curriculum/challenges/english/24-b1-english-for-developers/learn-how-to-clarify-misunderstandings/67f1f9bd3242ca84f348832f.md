`Minor bugs` are small errors or issues in a system or program. For example:

`There are some minor bugs in the app, but it still runs.` — This means the problems aren't serious but need fixing.

`User interface` (often called `UI`) is the visual part of software that people interact with. For example: 

`The user interface was updated to include a dark mode.` — This refers to changes users can see and use directly.
