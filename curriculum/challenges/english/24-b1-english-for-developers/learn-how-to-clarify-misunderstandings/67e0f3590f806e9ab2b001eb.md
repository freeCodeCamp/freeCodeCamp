# --explanation--

`Sit in on` means to attend something (like a class or meeting) without actively participating. For example:

`She asked if she could sit in on our design session.` – She wanted to observe the session but not lead or speak much.

`Code review` is a process where developers check each other's code for errors and improvements. For example:

`We found a small bug during the code review.` – The team checked the code and noticed a problem.
