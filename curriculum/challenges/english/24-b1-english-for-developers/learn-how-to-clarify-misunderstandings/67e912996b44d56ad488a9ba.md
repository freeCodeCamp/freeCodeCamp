# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Not exactly. "Inheritance" is when one class inherits properties and methods from another class, allowing for BLANK and BLANK functionality within a project.`

## --blanks--

`code reuse`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means using existing code again in new parts of a program instead of writing it from scratch.

---

`extending`

### --feedback--

This word means adding new features or behaviors to something that already exists. It ends with `-ing`.

# --explanation--

`Code reuse` refers to the practice of using existing code in new parts of a program. For example:

`The "Login" class was used in multiple applications to handle user access, which is a good example of code reuse.` - Instead of writing login logic for every app, the same code is reused, improving efficiency.

`Extending` means adding new features to something that already exists. For example:

`The "AdminUser" class extends the basic "User" class by adding an "approveUser()" method.` - The `AdminUser` keeps everything from `User` and builds on it with new capabilities.
