# --explanation--

`Clarifying` means explaining something in a way that removes confusion. It helps someone better understand a concept or situation. For example:

`Thanks for clarifying how the API works.` - The speaker is grateful because the explanation made the API easier to understand.

`Abstraction` refers to simplifying something by showing only the essential features and hiding the complex internal workings. For example:

`Using a login function is an example of abstraction - you don’t need to know how the password is checked, just that it works.` - This shows how users interact with simple interfaces while the technical logic stays hidden.
