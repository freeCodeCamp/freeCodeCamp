`polymorphism`

### --feedback--

This is a programming concept where one method can operate on different types of data or objects.

# --explanation--

`Mentioned` means to briefly refer to something or talk about it. It’s often used when someone brings up a topic in conversation. For example:

`She mentioned the meeting time in her email.` – She referred to the meeting time.

`Polymorphism` is a programming concept. It means a single function, method, or operator can be used with different types of data or objects. For example:

`In object-oriented programming, polymorphism allows a single method to behave differently based on the object that calls it.` - Here, `polymorphism` refers to a method that can perform different actions depending on which object is using it. For example, the same method `draw()` might behave differently when called by a `Circle` object or a `Rectangle` object.
