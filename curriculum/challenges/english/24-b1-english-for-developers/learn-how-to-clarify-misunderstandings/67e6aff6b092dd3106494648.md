`encapsulation`

### --feedback--

This is a programming concept where data and methods are bundled together, hiding the internal details.

# --explanation--

`Encapsulation` is a key principle in object-oriented programming. It means bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, often a class.

This concept helps hide the internal details of how the data is managed, exposing only what is necessary to the outside world. This improves security and makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.
