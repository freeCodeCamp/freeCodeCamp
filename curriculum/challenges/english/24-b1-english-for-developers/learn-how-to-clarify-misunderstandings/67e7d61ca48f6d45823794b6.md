# --explanation--

`Not quite` is used when you agree with something, but not fully. It's a polite way of saying someone is close but needs a small correction. For example:

Person 1: `Are we done with the project?`

Person 2: `Not quite, we still have some testing to do.`

This shows the project is almost finished, but not completely.

`Keeping...hidden` means to protect or hide certain details or information. For example:

`By keeping the password hidden in the system, we protect user privacy.` - This means the password is not accessible directly, ensuring privacy and security.
