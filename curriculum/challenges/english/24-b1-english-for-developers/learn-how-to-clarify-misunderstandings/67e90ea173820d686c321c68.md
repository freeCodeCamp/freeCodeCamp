## --sentence--

`Not exactly. "Inheritance" is when one BLANK BLANK BLANK and BLANK from another class, allowing for code reuse and extending functionality within a project.`

## --blanks--

`class`

### --feedback--

This is a basic building block in object-oriented programming that defines a blueprint for creating objects.

---

`inherits`

### --feedback--

This verb means to receive or take over something from another source. It ends with `-s`.

---

`properties`

### --feedback--

This word in the plural form means characteristics or qualities that describe something, like the color or size of an apple.

---

`methods`

### --feedback--

This word in the plural form means actions or behaviors that something can perform, like a bird can fly.

# --explanation--

An example is `the "Student" class inherits properties and methods from the "Person" class`.

- `Student` and `Person` are both `classes`. A `class` defines a blueprint for creating objects with specific data and behavior.

- `Student` takes over features from `Person`, meaning it doesn't need to redefine shared traits â€” it reuses them.

- `Properties` are the variables or data inside the class, like `name` or `age`, that describe the object.

- `Methods` are the functions defined in the class, like `enroll()` or `introduce()`, that describe what the object can do.
