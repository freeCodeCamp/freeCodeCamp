# --explanation--

`Think of it as` is used to help someone understand a concept by comparing it to something they are already familiar with. It encourages you to imagine the concept in a way that makes it easier to understand. For example:

`Think of a function as a recipe.` - This helps you picture a function as a set of instructions, similar to how a recipe provides steps to create a dish.

`Wrapping code` means enclosing or packaging code in a way that controls access to it. This will `limit`the access to the code. For example:

`We're wrapping the database access code inside a function to hide the complexity from the rest of the program.` - This means the database interactions are hidden from the outside, and the function provides a simplified interface to work with.
