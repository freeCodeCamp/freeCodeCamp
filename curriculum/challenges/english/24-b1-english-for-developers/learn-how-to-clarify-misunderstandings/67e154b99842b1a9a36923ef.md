`Terms` refer to specific words or expressions used in a certain subject, like programming. For example:

`Some of the terms in the documentation were confusing.` – This means the vocabulary was hard to understand.

`New to me` means something you haven't seen or heard before. For example:

`This tool is new to me, but I'm excited to try it.` – This means you haven't used the tool before and it's unfamiliar to you.
