# --explanation--

`Breaking into` means dividing or splitting something as smaller parts. For example:

`We are breaking the project into smaller tasks.` - This means dividing the project into manageable pieces.

`Encapsulating` refers to wrapping something (like data or functionality) into a single unit or structure, keeping the details hidden and only exposing what's necessary. For example:

`Encapsulating the data in an object means users can only access the data through specific methods, not directly.` - This ensures that the data is controlled and safe from unintended changes or misuse.
