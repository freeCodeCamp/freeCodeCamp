# --explanation--

`Not necessarily` means something might not be true, even if it seems that way. For example:

- Person 1: `Is it going to be cancelled?`

- Person 2: `Not necessarily.` - This means it's possible, but not certain.

`Handling the bugs` means taking care of or solving the problems. For example:

`The team is handling the bugs related to login.` — They are working on fixing it.

`Launch schedule` is the planned timeline for releasing something, usually a product. For example:

`We are still on track with our launch schedule.` — This means the release is still planned as expected.
