<!-- (Audio) Mark: Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining. I also heard "encapsulation." Does that mean breaking code into smaller parts, like encapsulating it? -->

# --instructions--

# --questions--

## --text--

What is Mark trying to understand about "encapsulation"?

## --answers--

If it means combining all parts of a program into one large block.

### --feedback--

This is the opposite of what Mark is asking.

---

If it means organizing code into smaller, more manageable parts.

---

If it means removing all logic from the program.

### --feedback--

Mark isn’t asking about deleting or removing anything from the code.

---

If it means writing the same code in multiple places.

# --explanation--

Mark is asking whether encapsulation means `breaking code into smaller parts`. This shows he is trying to understand the concept in terms of organizing code better.

While he doesn’t fully define encapsulation, he’s on the right track — encapsulation involves grouping related data and behavior into a single unit, which often leads to cleaner and more manageable code.
