# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, listen to the way Mark describes the issue.

He says `mostly the menu`, which shows where the problem happens most often. Then he adds `another thing — sometimes the screen flickers`, meaning the flickering is a separate issue that happens occasionally.

These clues show that the issue is not limited to just one place.
