# --explanation--

Sophie starts by saying `not quite`, which shows that Mark's previous understanding was partially correct but needed clarification. She then provides the correct definition of encapsulation.

`Keeping some details hidden` refers to the practice of hiding the internal workings of a class or function, not exposing the internal details, like data or implementation logic, to the outside world.

The purpose of encapsulation is to make it easier for developers to use and manage the code.
