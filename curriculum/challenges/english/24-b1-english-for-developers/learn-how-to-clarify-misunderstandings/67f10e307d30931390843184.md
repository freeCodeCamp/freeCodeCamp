## --text--

After speaking with Mark, Lisa discovered that the problem was affecting the whole team, so she wrote a memo to inform everyone.

`Hi team,`

`Just a quick update: I spoke with Mark about a glitching issue in the menu â€” it sometimes disappears or shows the wrong options and acts weird. We also noticed flickering when switching tabs. The behavior is not consistent, but it happens enough to be a problem.`

`After checking a few machines, I confirmed it's happening across the team. It looks like a graphics driver or rendering problem, possibly linked to event handling in the UI framework.`

`Please update your graphics drivers as soon as possible. If the issue continues, we'll run further diagnostics.`

`Let me know if you have questions.`

`Lisa`
