# --explanation--

`Make the code easier to work with` means improving the code so that it's simpler to understand, maintain, and modify. Here's the breakdown of the structure:

- `Make` is used to indicate that you are causing something to change or improving it.

- `Easier` is used to describe the result of the action. You're making the code simpler to handle, reducing complexity and effort.

- `To work with` is placed at the end to describe the purpose or how the code can be interacted with.

For example:

`We've refactored the code to make it easier to work with.` - This shows that the code is now more user-friendly, requiring less effort from developers to understand.
