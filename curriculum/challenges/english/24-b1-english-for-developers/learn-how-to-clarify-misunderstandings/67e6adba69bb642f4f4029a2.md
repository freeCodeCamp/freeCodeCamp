# --explanation--

Sophie describes polymorphism as the ability of `a function or object to change its behavior depending on the context`. This means that polymorphism is not fixed or static â€” it adapts and behaves differently in different situations.

She uses `not just ... but` to further clarify that polymorphism isn't merely about having different forms (shapes); it is about the flexibility of the function or object in how it operates. This highlights the core idea that polymorphism is about functionality, not just appearance.
