`just the menu`

This three-word phrase means only the menu, and not anything else in the software.

# --explanation--

`Affect` means to cause a change or have an impact on something. For example:

`The software update may affect the performance` – This means the update might change or influence how well the software works.

`Just the menu` means only the menu is involved, not any other part of the software. For example:

`It's causing problems with just the menu, not the entire system` – This means the issue is limited to the menu, not affecting anything else.
