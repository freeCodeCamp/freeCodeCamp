# --explanation--

An `investor` is someone who provides money to a business or project in the hope of earning a return, often through profits or shares. Investors play a crucial role in funding and supporting companies, especially during financial difficulties. For example:

- `The startup secured an investor to help fund their new product line.` - An individual or organization provided money to develop the product.

- `TechCorp is looking for investors to expand internationally.` - The company is seeking financial support for their growth plans.

In the audio, Tom explains that getting new investors might improve the financial situation by providing the necessary funds, though it's not guaranteed to happen.
