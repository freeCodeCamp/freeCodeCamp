`If TechCorp went out of business, it will be a big shock.`

# --explanation--

The correct sentence, `If TechCorp went out of business, it would be a big shock`, follows the `Second Conditional` structure:

`If` + `Past Simple` tense, `would` + base verb.

This structure is used for unreal or unlikely scenarios, like imagining TechCorp going out of business.
