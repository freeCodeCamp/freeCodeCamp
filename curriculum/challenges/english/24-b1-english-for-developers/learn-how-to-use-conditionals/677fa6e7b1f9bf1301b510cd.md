# --explanation--

This is a `First Conditional` sentence. It describes a real or possible situation:

Condition: `If the application has memory leaks`.

Result: `It can lead to crashes`.

`Can` expresses a possibility, showing that crashes are likely but not guaranteed if memory leaks exist. For example:

`If you install the update, the app can run faster.` - Installing the update will make the app work more efficiently.
