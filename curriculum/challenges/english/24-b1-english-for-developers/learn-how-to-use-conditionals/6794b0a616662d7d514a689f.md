# --explanation--

Let's look at how the audio gives you clues to answer the question:  

In `Brian helped us`, `helped us` is key to understand Brian's role because it shows that he supported the team. Listen for the word `helped` to understand his role. 

`Set up a reminder` tells you exactly what Brian did. He didn't train, test, or complete tasks alone. He focused on organizing tools like reminders to help the team stay on track.  

In the audio, focus on words like `helped` and `set up a reminder.` These words give you the best clues about Brian's role.
