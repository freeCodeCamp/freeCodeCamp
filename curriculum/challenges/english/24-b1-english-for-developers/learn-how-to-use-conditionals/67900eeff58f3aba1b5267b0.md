<!-- (audio) Mark: Sometimes if the BIOS is corrupted, it prevents the computer from starting. If that's the case, it can be tricky to fix. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Sarah agrees with Mark. What would be the best reply what Mark is saying?

## --answers--

`Yeah, it is.`

### --feedback--

This answer doesn't match what Mark is saying. `It is` doesn't make sense when talking about whether the BIOS can stop the computer from starting.

`Yeah, it can.`

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

Let's break it down:

What did Mark say? He said the BIOS `prevents the computer from starting.` That means he's talking about what the BIOS **can do** when it's corrupted. 

If Sarah agrees, would she talk about what the BIOS **is** or what the BIOS **can do**? The second one, right? That's why `Yeah, it can` is the right choice.

Why is `yeah, it is` wrong? Because `it is` talks about the state of the BIOS, not what it can do. Here's an example:

**Correct**: `Yeah, it can.` – This agrees with Mark's point about what the BIOS can do.

**Incorrect**: `Yeah, it is.` – This doesn't fit because Mark isn't describing what the BIOS `is,` he's talking about its effects.
