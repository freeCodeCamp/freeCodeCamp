# --explanation--

Let's review the key vocabulary and grammar in this sentence:  

`Hard drive` is the part of a computer where all files and programs are stored. For example:  

`The hard drive is almost full, so I need to delete some old files.` – This means the hard drive doesn't have much space left.  

`Failing` means something is starting to stop working. For example: 

`The hard drive is failing, so we need to back up the files.` – This means the hard drive is breaking down and may stop working soon.  

`Is failing`is the `Present Continuous` tense, used to describe something happening now or temporarily. For example:  

`The hard drive is failing` – This means the hard drive currently has problems, and it is an ongoing issue.

In this sentence, `is failing` describes the hard drive's condition. It shows that the problem is happening now and might cause the computer to stop working soon.
