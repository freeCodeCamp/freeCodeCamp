# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why is Bob using `right` at the end of the sentence?

## --answers--

He is using it to confirm agreement or understanding.

---

He is using it to describe something correct.

### --feedback--

`Right` here is not describing something as correct. Think about how it is used at the end of a question.

---

He is using it to give directions.

### --feedback--

`Right` can mean a direction, like left or right, but that's not how Bob is using it here.

---

He is using it to indicate an action must be done immediately.

### --feedback--

`Right` is not asking for urgency. Listen again to how Bob uses it at the end of his sentence.

# --explanation--

`Right` at the end of a sentence is a question tag. It's used to confirm agreement or check if the listener understands. For example:

- `It's going to rain today, right?` - The speaker is asking for confirmation about the weather.

- `You finished the project, right?` - The speaker is checking if the listener completed the task.

In this dialogue, Bob is asking Maria to confirm or agree with his statement.
