`Power cable` refers to the wire that supplies electricity to the computer:

`Power` means energy or electricity, and `cable` is the wire or cord used to transfer it. For example:

- `Check if the power cable is properly connected before troubleshooting.` - Ensure the power cord is plugged in before fixing other issues.
