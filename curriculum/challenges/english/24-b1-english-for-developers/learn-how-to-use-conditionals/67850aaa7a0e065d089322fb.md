## --blanks--

`closed`

### --feedback--

---

`would affect`

### --feedback--

These two words are used in the `Second Conditional` to describe the impact or result of the hypothetical condition.

# --explanation--

The sentence uses the `Second Conditional`, which is structured as:

`If` + `Past Simple` or `Past Continuous` tense, `might / would / could` + base verb. In this example:

`If they closed` is the condition (imagining a shutdown).

`It would affect` is the result (what would happen as a consequence).

This type of conditional is used to talk about unreal or hypothetical situations.
