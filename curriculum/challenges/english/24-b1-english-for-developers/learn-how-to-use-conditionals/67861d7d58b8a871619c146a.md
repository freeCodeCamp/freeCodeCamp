# --explanation--

The phrase `doesn't look likely` means that something seems improbable or unlikely to happen. For example:

- `It doesn't look likely that we'll finish the project on time.` - It seems improbable that the deadline will be met.

- `With this weather, it doesn't look likely that we'll have a picnic today.` - The rain or bad weather makes a picnic seem improbable.

Tom uses this phrase to emphasize the low probability of securing new investors, even though it might help if it did happen.
