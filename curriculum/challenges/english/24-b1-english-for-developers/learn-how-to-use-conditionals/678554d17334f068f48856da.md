## --sentence--

`True. If that money goes away, those companies BLANK not survive.`

## --blanks--

`might`

### --feedback--

This modal verb is used to express possibility.

# --explanation--

The word `might` is a modal verb used to express possibility or a chance of something happening. It is less certain than `will` and suggests that something could happen, but it's not guaranteed. For example:

- `It might rain tomorrow.` - There is a chance of rain, but it's not certain.

- `She might join the meeting later.` - It's possible she will attend, but it's not definite.

In the dialogue, `might` shows the possibility that some companies could fail, depending on the condition.
