# --explanation--

The phrase `go out of business` means that a company closes permanently, often due to financial problems or lack of customers. For example:

- `If the company doesn't innovate, it could go out of business.` - Without introducing new ideas, the company might fail.

- `They nearly went out of business before launching their successful app.` - The company was close to failing until their app became a hit.

Lisa is talking about a hypothetical situation where TechCorp shuts down permanently.
