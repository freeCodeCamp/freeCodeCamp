# --explanation--

Mark says, `If the application has memory leaks, it can lead to crashes`.

The key term here is `memory leaks`. They occur when a program allocates memory for temporary tasks but fails to release it when the tasks are complete. For example:

- `If the application uses too much memory, it could crash.` - This suggests that memory usage is the problem leading to crashes.

- `Memory leaks can cause performance issues and crashes.` - This shows how memory leaks are a factor in causing crashes.
