# --explanation--

Maria asks, `Did you notice something wrong?` She's asking if there's a specific issue. The phrase `No. Not really` reassures her that there isn't anything serious to worry about. It's polite, casual, and keeps the conversation light. For example:  

Question: `Is something wrong with the system?`  

Answer: `No. Not really.` – This means there might be minor concerns, but nothing serious enough to cause alarm.  

Now, let's think about why the other option doesn't work:  

`Yes, it's a big problem.` – This suggests something serious is wrong, which doesn't reassure Maria. Instead, it might make her more concerned.
