It's a system component that controls the hardware of the computer. All letters are capitalized.

# --explanation--

`BIOS` stands for `Basic Input/Output System`. It is a crucial system component that helps initialize the hardware during startup and loads the operating system. For example:

- `If the BIOS is outdated, your system may have performance issues.` - An old BIOS can cause your computer to run poorly.

- `Press F2 to enter the BIOS and change system settings.` - Pressing F2 lets you access the BIOS to modify the system's options.
