# --explanation--

Maria uses the word `automate` to suggest making the process automatic or handled by machines or systems instead of humans. This helps reduce the chance of human error because machines follow predefined instructions without making mistakes caused by fatigue or oversight. For example:

`We can automate the process of sending email updates.` - You can use a program to automatically send emails instead of doing it manually.
