## --sentence--

`Lisa: Hey Tom, have you ever thought about what would happen if TechCorp went out of business?`

`Tom: If TechCorp went out of business, it would be a big BLANK. They work with so many companies. Why do you ask?`

`Lisa: I read they might be having BLANK. If they closed, it would affect a lot of tech companies, wouldn't it?`

`Tom: Yes, it would. If they BLANK, a lot of people would lose their jobs. And their current projects would stop, wouldn't they?`

`Lisa: That's right. If that happened, a lot of smaller companies would be BLANK, too. TechCorp helps fund some of their projects.`

`Tom: True. If that money goes away, those companies might not survive. It would be a BLANK for everyone.`

`Lisa: Do you think they can fix their money problems?`

`Tom: Maybe, but it's BLANK. If they get new BLANK, it might help, but it doesn't look likely.`

`Lisa: I hope they do. If they go out of business, it would change everything.`
