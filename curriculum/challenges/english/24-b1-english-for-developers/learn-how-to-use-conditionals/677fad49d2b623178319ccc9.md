The support team published a quick guide to troubleshooting boot issues:

`Having boot issues?`

`Troubleshooting computer issues can feel overwhelming, but understanding them can make the process easier. Here's a simple step-by-step checklist for diagnosing and fixing computer boot problems:`

`1. Check the power connection: If the power cable isn't securely connected, the computer won't turn on.`

`2. Inspect the BIOS: If the BIOS is corrupted, the system might fail to boot. You may need to reset or update it.`

`3. Examine the hard drive: If the hard drive is failing, the operating system won't load. Run diagnostic tools to confirm.`

`4. Update drivers: If the software crashes, it could be due to outdated or incompatible drivers. Always keep drivers updated to prevent this.`

`5. Watch out for memory leaks: If the application has memory leaks, it can slow down or crash the system. Look for signs like freezing or lagging.`

`Following these steps can help you identify the root cause and get things running smoothly again.`

What are signs of memory leaks in a system?

## --answers--

The system shuts down unexpectedly.

### --feedback--

The guide doesn't mention shutdowns as a symptom of memory leaks.

---

The computer fails to boot.

### --feedback--

A failure to boot is associated with other issues, such as power or BIOS problems, not memory leaks.

---

Freezing or lagging.

---

The drivers are outdated.

### --feedback--

Outdated drivers can cause crashes but are not specifically tied to memory leaks.

# --explanation--

The guide notes that `memory leaks` can cause performance issues, such as `slowing down` or `freezing`. These signs are observable and help users recognize when applications fail to release unused memory.

Focus on the part where the guide links specific symptoms (`freezing`, `lagging`) to the problem (`memory leaks`), giving users clear indicators to diagnose performance issues.
