Sarah decided to e-mail and document their conversation:

`Hi Tom,`

`It was good talking with you earlier. I wanted to summarize our discussion and give you some clear steps to help you get everything working correctly.`

`1. Visual Studio Code - Live preview:`

`Make sure the live server extension is installed and running. If it's still not displaying, check your project settings and ensure that all files are correctly set up for real-time previews.`

`2. IntelliJ IDEA - Auto-Completion:`

`Double-check your project settings. If auto-completion isn’t working, the project might not be set up right. Go to your project settings and verify that all necessary plugins are enabled.`

`3. Eclipse - Git Tools:`

`The Git tools are built-in, but they won’t be visible unless your project is linked to Git. Make sure your project is connected to the Git repository.`

`Let me know if you need any more help, or if you'd like to go through a detailed walkthrough together.`

`Best, Sarah`
