# --explanation--

`Sign up`, `sign in`, and `sign out` have different meanings, often used when managing accounts or accessing systems.

`Sign up` means to register or create an account. For example:

- `I want to sign up for the new course.` - You want to create an account or register for the course.

`Sign in` means to log into an account you already have. For example:

- `Please sign in with your username and password.` - You need to enter your login details to access your account.

`Sign out` means to log out of an account. For example:

- `Don't forget to sign out of your account when you're done.` - You need to log out after finishing your work.
