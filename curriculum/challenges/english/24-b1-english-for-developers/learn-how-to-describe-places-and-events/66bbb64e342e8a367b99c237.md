# --explanation--

When someone says they are `struggling with` something, it means they are having difficulty or trouble with it. For example:

- `The team is struggling with the project deadline.` - The team is having trouble meeting the deadline.

`IDEs` stands for `Integrated Development Environments`. These are software tools used by developers to write, test, and debug code. Examples of popular IDEs include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.

In the dialogue, Tom is having trouble with his IDEs and wants to talk to Sarah about it.
