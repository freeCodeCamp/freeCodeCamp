# --explanation--

The `Present Continuous` tense is used to describe actions happening right now. To express that something **is not** happening, the negative form is used. 

In the sentence `The live preview isn't showing`, `isn't` is a contraction of `is not`, making the sentence negative. 

This indicates that the live preview is not functioning as expected. So, Tom is reporting that the live preview is currently not visible in Visual Studio Code.
