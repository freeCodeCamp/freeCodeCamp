# --explanation--

`Might` is used to express possibility or uncertainty. It suggests that something is possible, but not certain. For example:

- `The system might crash if too many users log in at the same time.` - There is a possibility of a system crash, but it's not certain.

- `He might finish the coding task by the end of the day.` - He could finish the task, but it's not definite.
