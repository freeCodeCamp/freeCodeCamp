# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Also, in IntelliJ IDEA, the code auto-completion isn't popping up. BLANK automatic?`

## --blanks--

`Isn't it`

### --feedback--

A tag question using the contraction of `is not` followed by a pronoun. The first letter is capitalized.

# --explanation--

A `tag question` is a short question added to the end of a sentence to confirm or check something. It's often used when the speaker expects the listener to agree with them. For example: 

- `It's a nice day, isn't it?` - The speaker expects that the listener will agree that it's a nice day.

- `They are coming to the meeting, aren't they?` - The speaker expects that the listener will agree that they are coming to the meeting.

When Tom says, `Isn't it automatic?`, he is asking for confirmation that the auto-completion should happen automatically.
