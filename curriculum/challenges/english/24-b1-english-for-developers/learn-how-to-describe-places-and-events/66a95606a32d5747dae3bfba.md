# --explanation--

After Lisa mentions the project, Bob asks a question to learn more about the people involved. Bob uses the contraction `Who's`, which stands for `Who is`, to ask about the team members. 

Pay attention to the second part of the conversation where Bob focuses on the team, not the project itself.
