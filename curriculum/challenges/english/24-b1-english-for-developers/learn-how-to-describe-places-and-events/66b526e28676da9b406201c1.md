# --explanation--

`Perhaps` is used to express uncertainty or possibility. It is similar in meaning to `maybe`. For example:

- `Perhaps we will launch the new feature next week.` - There is a possibility of launching the new feature, but it is not certain.

- `They are perhaps the best developer for this project.` - They might be the best developer, but it is not definite.
