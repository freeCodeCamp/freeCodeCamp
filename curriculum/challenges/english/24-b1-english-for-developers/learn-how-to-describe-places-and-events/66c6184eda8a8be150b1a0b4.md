# --explanation--

`Have to` is used to express that something is necessary or required. It indicates that there is no choice but to do something. For example:

- `You have to save your changes before closing the program.` - This means it's necessary to save changes before closing the program.

When Tom says, `I'll have to check again`, he is stating that it's necessary for him to check the settings one more time, suggesting he's not sure about it.
