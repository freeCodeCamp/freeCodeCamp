# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I think we are, but maybe it's not BLANK right.`

## --blanks--

`set up`

### --feedback--

These two words together mean to configure something so it works correctly.

# --explanation--

`Set up right` means to configure something correctly so that it works as expected. If something isn't `set up right`, it might not function properly. For example:

- `The printer isn't working because it's not set up right.` - The printer isn't configured correctly.

- `Make sure the software is set up right before you start using it.` - You need to configure the software correctly to ensure it works.
