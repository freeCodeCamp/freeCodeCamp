<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: Hey Sarah, do you have a moment? I'm struggling with these IDEs.
Sarah: Sure, I'm not busy. What's the problem? -->

# --description--

Sarah could have said she was free, but instead, she uses the negative form `I'm not busy` to emphasize that she isn't busy, so she can talk. 

This is a common way in English to politely offer help by stating what you are *not* doing, which can be more indirect and tactful.

This is confirmed by her following sentence `What's the problem?`, which is a way to ask Tom to give her more details.

See another example:

- `I'm not tired, so I can stay longer.` - This implies the person is available without directly saying they are.
