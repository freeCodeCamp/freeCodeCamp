# --explanation--

Tom says, `it's not showing the Git tools,` which gives important clues to identify his problem. 

The key phrase is `not showing`, which points to a visibility issue rather than a problem with knowledge or installation. 

Pay attention to the part where Tom talks about something that should be visible in Eclipse but isn't. This will help you find the correct answer.
