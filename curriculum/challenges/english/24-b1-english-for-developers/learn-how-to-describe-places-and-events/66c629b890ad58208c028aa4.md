# --explanation--

`Walkthrough` is made up of two parts: 

- `Walk` refers to moving step by step, usually on foot.

- `Through` means moving from one side to another or from start to finish.

When these words are combined into `walkthrough`, it means a step-by-step explanation or guide to help someone understand how to do something. For example:

- `The software includes a walkthrough to help new users get started.` - There is a guide that explains each step to using the software.

- `Let me give you a walkthrough of the process.` - You will explain each step of the process in detail.
