`isn't`

### --feedback--

It indicates that something is not happening right now. It is a contracted form of `is not`.

# --explanation--

`IntelliJ IDEA` is a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used by developers to write, test, and debug code. It is known for its powerful features, including `auto-completion`, which helps you code faster by suggesting possible completions as you type. 

When Tom says that `auto-completion isn't popping up`, he means that the feature, which normally suggests code as you type, isn't appearing on the screen like it should.
