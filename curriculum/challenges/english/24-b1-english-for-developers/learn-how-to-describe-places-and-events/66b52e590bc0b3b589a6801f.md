# --questions--

## --text--

Which option is the best answer to Anna's question?

## --answers--

`We have them quarterly.`

---

`The training sessions last two hours.`

### --feedback--

Anna wants to know about the frequency of the training sessions, not their duration.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

When someone asks `How often do we hold these training sessions?`, they are asking about the frequency, or how regularly the sessions occur. 

Pay attention to answers that give a time frame, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Be careful not to confuse this with answers that talk about the duration of the session, which is not what Anna is asking.
