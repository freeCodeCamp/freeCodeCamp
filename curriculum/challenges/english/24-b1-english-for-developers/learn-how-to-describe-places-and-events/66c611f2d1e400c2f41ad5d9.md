# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`It usually is, but it BLANK work if the project BLANK set up right.`

## --blanks--

`doesn't`

### --feedback--

A contraction of `does not`, showing that something is not happening or not true. 

---

`isn't`

### --feedback--

A contraction of `is not`, used to make the sentence negative in the `Present Simple` tense. 

# --explanation--

In the `Present Simple` tense, the negative form is created using `doesn't` or `isn't` for third-person singular subjects (`he, she, it`). 

- Use `doesn't` with action verbs to show that something is not happening, like `It doesn't work.`

- Use `isn't` with forms of `to be` to show that something is not true, like `isn't set up.`

In this sentence, you'll need both `doesn't` and `isn't` to correctly describe why the feature isn't working as expected.
