# --explanation--

Tom says, `It's supposed to be,` followed by `This is frustrating`. He then asks, `Are these IDEs always this tricky?` 

These statements show that Tom is frustrated because he finds the IDEs difficult to use. 

Pay attention to his focus on the tools, not his coding skills or project, to understand the source of his frustration.
