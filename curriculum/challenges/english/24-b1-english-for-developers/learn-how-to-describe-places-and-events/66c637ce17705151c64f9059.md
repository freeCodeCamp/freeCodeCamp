## --sentence--

`Tom: Hey Sarah, do you have a moment? I'm struggling with these IDEs.`

`Sarah: Sure, I'm not busy. What's the problem?`

`Tom: The live preview isn't showing in Visual Studio Code. BLANK to support that feature?`

`Sarah: It should, but BLANK because the live server extension might not be running. Are you using that extension for real-time previews?`

`Tom: I think we are, but maybe BLANK right. Also, in IntelliJ IDEA, the code auto-completion isn't popping up. Isn't it automatic?`

`Sarah: It usually is, but it doesn't work if the project isn't set up right. Have you checked the settings?`

`Tom: I'll have to check again. And in Eclipse, it's not showing the Git tools. BLANK built in?`

`Sarah: Yes, they are, but BLANK if the project isn't linked to Git. Is your project connected to Git in Eclipse?`

`Tom: It's supposed to be. This is frustrating. BLANK IDEs always this tricky?`

`Sarah: Not always, but they can be when they're not set up properly. Do you want a walkthrough on setting them up?`

`Tom: Yes, please. That would be great.`
