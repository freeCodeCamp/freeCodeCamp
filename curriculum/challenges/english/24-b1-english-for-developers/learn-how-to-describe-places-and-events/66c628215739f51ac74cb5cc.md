## --sentence--

`Not always, but they can be BLANK they're not set up properly.`

## --blanks--

`when`

### --feedback--

This word introduces the condition or situation that causes something to happen.

# --explanation--

`when` is used here to describe a specific condition or situation that causes something to happen. 

In Sarah's sentence, `when` introduces the condition where the IDEs become tricky: `if they're not set up properly`. For example:

- `The program crashes when it runs out of memory.` - The condition of running out of memory causes the program to crash.

- `The printer only works when it's plugged in.` - The condition of being plugged in allows the printer to work.

In both cases, `when` is used to explain the situation in which something occurs.
