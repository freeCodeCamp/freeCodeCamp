---

A habit he continues now.

### --feedback--

James uses the phrase `used to`, which shows he is describing something he did in the past, not currently.

---

A process he never followed.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

James says, `I used to just write code without thinking much about the end user.` 

`Used to` indicates a past habit or action that is no longer true. 

This sentence shows that he previously wrote code without considering the end user but has since changed his approach.
