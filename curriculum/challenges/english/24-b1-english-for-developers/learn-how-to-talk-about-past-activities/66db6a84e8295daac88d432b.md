# --explanation--

In Linda's statement, pay attention to the contrast signaled by the word `but`. Initially, she mentions that they've made progress, which is positive. However, she follows this with a problem that still needs to be resolved. 

Focus on the phrase `aren't responding correctly` - it indicates that the issue is with the functionality of some elements, specifically the icons and buttons. 

This helps you identify that the problem relates to their responsiveness, not the design, speed, or timeline.
