# --explanation--

To understand James's question, let's break down the structure in the `Present Perfect` tense:

- `Has` is the auxiliary verb used to form the question. It helps to ask about an action that might have been completed up to now.

- `Been` is used to indicate the passive voice, meaning the action (informing) has been done to the subject.

- `Informed` is the past participle of the verb `inform`, showing that the action of giving information might have already happened.

The subject in this question is `the development team`. 

Since James is asking, `Has the development team been informed?` he wants to know if the action of informing has been completed specifically for the development team.
