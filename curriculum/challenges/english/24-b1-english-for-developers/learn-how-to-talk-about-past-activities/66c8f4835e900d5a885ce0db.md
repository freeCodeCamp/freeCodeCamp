# --explanation--

In `UI display issue`, `UI` stands for User Interface, while `display issue` means that these `UI` elements are not appearing or functioning as they should.

`Across different screen sizes` means that the problem is happening on devices with various screen dimensions, such as smartphones, tablets, and desktops.
