# --explanation--

`Across` is used to describe something that happens over a wide area or in many different places. It can indicate movement from one side to another or something spread out over a range. For example:

- `The company has offices across the country.` - The offices are spread out in different locations in the country.

- `She walked across the street.` - She moved from one side of the street to the other.

`Across different screen sizes` means that the issue appears on many different screen sizes.
