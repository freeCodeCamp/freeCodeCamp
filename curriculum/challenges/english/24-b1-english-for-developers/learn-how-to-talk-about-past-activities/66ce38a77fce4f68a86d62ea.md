# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on the specific issues the user describes in the email. The user mentions that elements on the homepage are `overlapping` and `not adapting well` to smaller screens. Look closely at the part where the user specifies which elements are affectedâ€”the `navigation bar` and `footer`. 

Make sure the answer you choose reflects these exact details about overlapping elements and mobile screen adaptation, as these are the specific issues the user highlighted.
