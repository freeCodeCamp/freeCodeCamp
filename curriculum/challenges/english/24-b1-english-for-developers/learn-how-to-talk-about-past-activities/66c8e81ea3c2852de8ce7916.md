<!-- (Audio) James: Have you seen the latest user feedback? They've mentioned that some elements on our homepage aren't displaying correctly on mobile devices. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Linda has read the reports. Which option is the best answer?

## --answers--

`Yes, I have.`

---

`Yes, I do.`

### --feedback--

`Do` is used in answer to questions in the Present Simple tense, not the `Present Perfect`. Since James asked the question in the `Present Perfect` tense, the correct short answer should use `Present Perfect`.

# --explanation--

When someone asks you a **yes/no question**, you can often respond with a short answer. This applies to questions in the `Present Perfect` tense as well. 

To give a short answer, use `Yes` or `No`, followed by the subject (like `I`, `we`, or `they`) and then `have` or `haven't`. For example for the question `Have you seen the report?` you could use the short answers:

- `Yes, I have.`, or 

- `No, I haven't.`

This makes your answer clear and concise without repeating the whole question.
