# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on the phrases `they've emailed us` and `showing how` in the audio. These phrases indicate that Linda is talking about what was **included** in the emails. 

She mentions `screenshots`, which are visual examples sent by the users to demonstrate the problem with the overlapping elements on their devices. The correct answer should reflect this focus on visual content rather than text descriptions or reports.
