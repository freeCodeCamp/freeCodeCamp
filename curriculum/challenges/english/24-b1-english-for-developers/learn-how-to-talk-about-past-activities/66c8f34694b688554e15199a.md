`reviewed`

### --feedback--

This is the past participle form of the verb `review`.

# --explanation--

In the `Present Perfect` tense, contractions often combine the subject and the auxiliary verb `have` or `has`. For example:

- `I have` becomes `I've`.

- `She has` becomes `She's`.

`Reviewed` is the past participle of `review`, used here to indicate that the action of checking the reports has already happened.
