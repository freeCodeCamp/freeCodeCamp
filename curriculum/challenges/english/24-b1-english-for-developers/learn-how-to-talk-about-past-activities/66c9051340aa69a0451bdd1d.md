<!-- (Audio) Linda: They've emailed us screenshots showing how the elements overlap on their devices. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`They've emailed us screenshots showing how the elements BLANK their devices.`

## --blanks--

`overlap on`

### --feedback--

These two words work together to describe how elements are positioned incorrectly on a specific device. One word deals with the positioning problem, and the other specifies the location.

# --explanation--

`Overlap` is used when one thing covers or extends over part of another. In this context, it means that elements on the screen are incorrectly positioned, covering parts of each other.

`On` is used to indicate the device where the overlapping occurs. It shows the relationship between the elements and the devices. For example:

`The images overlap on the webpage, making it difficult to see all the content clearly.` - Here, `overlap` describes the positioning issue and `on` specifies where it occurs.
