# --explanation--

`Smaller screens` typically refer to devices like smartphones and tablets that have smaller displays compared to desktop computers or laptops. 

When something `doesn't adapt well to smaller screens`, it means the content or layout doesn't display correctly, making it difficult for users to interact with the website.
