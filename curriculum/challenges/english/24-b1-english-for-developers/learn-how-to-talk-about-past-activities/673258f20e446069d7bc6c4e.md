# --explanation--

`I've learned so much about user interface design` tells you that James has gained new knowledge recently, so anything suggesting he hasn't learned is incorrect.
  
`Before this, I hadn't focused much on the user experience aspect of development` shows that his attention to user experience is new, meaning he did not focus on it in the past but has started doing so recently.
