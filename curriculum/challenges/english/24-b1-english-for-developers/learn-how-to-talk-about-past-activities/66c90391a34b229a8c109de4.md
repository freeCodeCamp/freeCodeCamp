`They've` is a contraction of `They have`, used here in the `Present Perfect` tense to indicate that the action (emailing) has been completed.

`Emailed` is the past participle of the verb `email`, and `us` indicates the recipients. 

`Emailed us` shows the action that the users took to send the screenshots.
