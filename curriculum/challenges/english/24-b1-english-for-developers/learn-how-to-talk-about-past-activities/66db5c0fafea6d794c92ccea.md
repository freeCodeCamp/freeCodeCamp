# --explanation--

To know if something is performing well, look for words or phrases that indicate a good result or improvement. 

Linda uses the phrase `have already made a big difference`.

`Made a big difference` suggests an important or noticeable change. When something has `made a big difference` in a positive context, it usually means that the change is helpful or effective.
