Consider the word that describes taking action in advance to prepare for future situations.

# --explanation--

`Staying` comes from the verb `stay`, which means to remain in a certain state or condition. 

`Proactive` means taking action in advance to deal with an expected situation, instead of reacting to it after it happens. Being proactive means thinking ahead and preparing for future challenges.

In Bob's sentence, he is thanking Linda for continuing to be proactive, meaning she is always thinking ahead and taking action.
