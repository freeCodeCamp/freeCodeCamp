# --explanation--

The correct answer should provide information that directly responds to Bob's question `What do we have to deal with now?`.

Look for an option that indicates preparation or awareness of the tasks.

`I've compiled a list` shows that Linda has already prepared information on what needs to be addressed, making it more relevant response.
