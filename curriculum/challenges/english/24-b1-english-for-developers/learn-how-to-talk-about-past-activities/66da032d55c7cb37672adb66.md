# --explanation--

`Drop` refers to a decrease in amount or level. When people say there is `a drop in sales`, it means sales have gone down. 

When you add the word `significant` before `drop`, it means the decrease is large or important. For example:

`A significant drop in sales` - The sales have decreased a lot.
