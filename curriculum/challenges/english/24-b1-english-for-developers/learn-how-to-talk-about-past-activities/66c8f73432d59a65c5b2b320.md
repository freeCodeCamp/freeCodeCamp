# --explanation--

James is asking Linda if they have ever solved a similar problem in the past. Key points to consider:

- In `Have we fixed` James wants to know if the action of fixing something similar has been done before.

- `Anything like this` refers to a problem or issue similar to the current one they are facing.

- `Before` indicates that James is asking about any time in the past.
