# --explanation--

James's question, `how long have we been collaborating on these updates?`, can be broken down to understand what he wants to know:

- `how long` signals he is asking about time or duration.

- `have been collaborating` shows an action that started in the past and continues to the present. 

- `on these updates` specifies that the focus is on their joint work related to updates.

Together, this structure shows that James is interested in finding out the length of time they've been working together on updates, not specific details or future plans.
