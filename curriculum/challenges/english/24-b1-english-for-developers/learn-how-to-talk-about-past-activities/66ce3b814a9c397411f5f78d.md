# --explanation--

The user is polite and helpful in how they explain the problem. The opening, `Hi Team`, is friendly and respectful, which sets a positive tone. The user clearly describes the issue without blaming anyone or showing frustration, which shows they want to solve the problem, not just complain. 

Phrases like `I've attached a few screenshots` show that the user is trying to help by giving evidence, and the closing, `Thanks for looking into this!` shows they appreciate the team's efforts.

These parts of the email show that the tone is polite and constructive, not frustrated, casual, or apologetic.
