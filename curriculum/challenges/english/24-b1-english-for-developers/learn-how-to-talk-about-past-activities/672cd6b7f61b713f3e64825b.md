## --sentence--

`I've been BLANK the design team BLANK three years.`

## --blanks--

`part of`

### --feedback--

These two words together mean belonging to or being included in a group or team. The first word is a noun, and the second is a preposition.

---

`for`

### --feedback--

This preposition indicates the length of time something has lasted.

# --explanation--

`To have been part of something` means to belong to or to be included in a group, team, or organization. It implies that the person has contributed or participated in that group. For example:

`I've been part of this project since it started.` - Suggests the person has been involved in the project from the beginning.

The preposition `for` is used to indicate a period of time in this context. When combined with the `Present Perfect` tense (`have been`), it shows how long something has lasted up to the present. For example:

`She has worked here for five years.` - She started working there five years ago and is still working there now.
