# --explanation--

`Anticipate` means to expect or predict something that might happen in the future. It is used when you believe something will happen and are preparing for it or thinking about it in advance. For example:

 `She anticipates that the meeting will be very long.` - It means that she predicts the meeting will take a lot of time.

In `I anticipate we'll start receiving more detailed reports`, she is predicting that more detailed reports will come soon.
