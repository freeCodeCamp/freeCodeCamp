# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`It's been BLANK now.`

## --blanks--

`over a year`

### --feedback--

These three words together indicate a time period. They are a preposition, an article and a period of time.

# --explanation--

`It's been` is a contraction of `It has been` which describes something that started in the past and continues up to now. 

`Over a year` tells you the amount of time that has passed. `Over` means more than, so `over a year` means that the collaboration has lasted more than one year.

`Now` emphasizes that the statement is up-to-date and still true at this moment.

Together, `It's been over a year now.` means that their collaboration has lasted more than a year and continues to the present.
