`mentioned`

### --feedback--

The past participle of `mention`.

# --explanation--

In the `Present Perfect` tense, contractions often combine the subject and the auxiliary verb `have` or `has`. For example:

- `They have` becomes `They've`.

- `He has` becomes `He's`.

The verb `mentioned` is the past participle of `mention`, used here to indicate something that happened before now.
