In his article, What Programming Language Should I Learn First in 2024? Quincy Larson, the founder and teacher of freeCodeCamp, explains why JavaScript is the best language to learn first.

`I think JavaScript is the best language to start with. It's flexible and can be used for both front-end and back-end development. With libraries and tools like Node.js, you can build many things, from simple prototypes to big apps. Plus, there is a lot of demand for JavaScript developers, so it's a good choice for beginners.`

`In my case, Python is also a good language, but I believe JavaScript is more useful in the long run. It has a large community and many resources to help you learn. I feel it's easier to find support when you start learning it.`

`I'd rather see beginners focus on JavaScript first. Once you know it, learning other languages like Python becomes easier. It's a great way to begin your journey in programming and open up more career opportunities.`
