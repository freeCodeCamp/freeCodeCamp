Following the conversation with Lisa, Bob sent an email to the team:

`Dear Team,`

`I hope you're doing well! We need to choose the best cloud platform for our next project. We're looking at three options: AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Each platform has its own strengths, but I'm not sure which one is the best choice for us.`

`Well, AWS is very popular, but it could be a bit complex for some of us. Google Cloud might be easier to use, especially for smaller projects. Azure could work well, too, since it fits with the Microsoft tools we already use.`

`I've created a poll to gather everyone's opinion. Please take a moment to vote for the platform you think would be best for our team. The poll will be open for the next few days, and your input will help us make a more informed decision.`

`Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`

`Bob`

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, look for where Bob talks about how each platform fits the team's needs.  

- Pay attention to words that describe compatibility, like `fits with` or `works well with`.  

- Bob mentions different strengths for AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Focus on which one he connects to the tools the team already uses. 

- Look for a phrase that clearly links a platform to an existing setup rather than general advantages.  

By following these clues, you can identify which platform Bob suggests fits with the team's current tools.
