# --explanation--

Think about what Maria highlights as advantages of `IntelliJ IDEA`.  

She mentions it `integrates well with various build tools` — why would integration with build tools be useful for a team?  

She also says it has `built-in support for version control` — how does version control help teams manage their projects?  

By focusing on these key points, you can see that Maria values `integration with build tools` and `version control` because they support her team's workflow.
