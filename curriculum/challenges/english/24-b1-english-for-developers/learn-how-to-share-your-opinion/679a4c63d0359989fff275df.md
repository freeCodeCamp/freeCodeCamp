# --explanation--

Let's break down why the correct answer is the best choice:  

`I see.` – This phrase shows that Tom acknowledges Linda's opinion, meaning he understands her point.  

`Well, I think JavaScript is more versatile.` – This introduces his own opinion in a respectful way, offering a different perspective.  

The key here is to acknowledge Linda's point before introducing a different perspective.
