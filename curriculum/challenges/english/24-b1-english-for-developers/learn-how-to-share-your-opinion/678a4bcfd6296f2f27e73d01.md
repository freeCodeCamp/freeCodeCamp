# --explanation--

`Prefer` means to like something more than something else. It's used to express a choice or a stronger liking for one option over others. It can be followed by a noun or a verb in the `-ing` form (gerund). For example:

- `I prefer Python over Java.` - It means you like Python more than Java. The preposition `over` is used to indicate a preference for one noun (Python) in comparison to another noun (Java).
  
- `He prefers debugging to coding.` - It means he enjoys finding and fixing errors in code more than writing new code. The word `to` is used as a preposition to indicate the comparison between two activities (debugging and coding).
