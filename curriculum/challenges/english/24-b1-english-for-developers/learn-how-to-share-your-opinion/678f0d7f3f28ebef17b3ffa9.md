# --explanation--

`Quite` is used to indicate a moderate degree of something, usually meaning it's more than just a little but not extreme. For example:

`The framework is quite efficient for handling large datasets.` - This means the framework is fairly efficient, but not the most efficient solution available.

`Popular` is used when something is liked or admired by a large number of people. For example:

`React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.` - This means React is widely used by many developers in the tech community.
