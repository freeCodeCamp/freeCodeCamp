# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://stock-price-checker.freecodecamp.rocks/>.

Since all reliable stock price APIs require an API key, we've built a workaround. Use <https://stock-price-checker-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/> to get up-to-date stock price information without needing to sign up for your own key.

Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

-   Clone [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-stockchecker/) and complete your project locally.
-   Use [our repl.it starter project](https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-stockchecker) to complete your project.
-   Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the `Solution Link` field. Optionally, also submit a link to your projects source code in the `GitHub Link` field.

# --instructions--

1.  SET `NODE_ENV` to `test` without quotes and set `DB` to your MongoDB connection string
2.  Complete the project in `routes/api.js` or by creating a handler/controller
3.  You will add any security features to `server.js`
4.  You will create all of the functional tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`

Write the following tests in `tests/2_functional-tests.js`:

-   Viewing one stock: GET request to `/api/stock-prices/`
-   Viewing one stock and liking it: GET request to `/api/stock-prices/`
-   Viewing the same stock and liking it again: GET request to `/api/stock-prices/`
-   Viewing two stocks: GET request to `/api/stock-prices/`
-   Viewing two stocks and liking them: GET request to `/api/stock-prices/`

# --hints--

You can provide your own project, not the example URL.

```js
(getUserInput) => {
  assert(
    !/.*\/stock-price-checker\.freecodecamp\.rocks/.test(getUserInput('url'))
  );
};
```

You should set the content security policies to only allow loading of scripts and CSS from your server.

```js
async (getUserInput) => {
  const data = await fetch(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/app-info');
  const parsed = await data.json();
  assert.isTrue(
    parsed.headers['content-security-policy'].includes("script-src 'self'")
  );
  assert.isTrue(
    parsed.headers['content-security-policy'].includes("style-src 'self'")
  );
};
```

You can send a `GET` request to `/api/stock-prices`, passing a NASDAQ stock symbol to a `stock` query parameter. The returned object will contain a property named `stockData`.

```js
async (getUserInput) => {
  const data = await fetch(
    getUserInput('url') + '/api/stock-prices?stock=GOOG'
  );
  const parsed = await data.json();
  assert.property(parsed, 'stockData');
};
```

The `stockData` property includes the `stock` symbol as a string, the `price` as a number, and `likes` as a number.

```js
async (getUserInput) => {
  const data = await fetch(
    getUserInput('url') + '/api/stock-prices?stock=GOOG'
  );
  const parsed = await data.json();
  const ticker = parsed.stockData;
  assert.typeOf(ticker.price, 'number');
  assert.typeOf(ticker.likes, 'number');
  assert.typeOf(ticker.stock, 'string');
};
```

You can also pass along a `like` field as `true` (boolean) to have your like added to the stock(s). Only 1 like per IP should be accepted.

```js

```

If you pass along 2 stocks, the returned value will be an array with information about both stocks. Instead of `likes`, it will display `rel_likes` (the difference between the likes on both stocks) for both `stockData` objects.

```js
async (getUserInput) => {
  const data = await fetch(
    getUserInput('url') + '/api/stock-prices?stock=GOOG&stock=MSFT'
  );
  const parsed = await data.json();
  const ticker = parsed.stockData;
  assert.typeOf(ticker, 'array');
  assert.property(ticker[0], 'rel_likes');
  assert.property(ticker[1], 'rel_likes');
};
```

All 5 functional tests are complete and passing.

```js
async (getUserInput) => {
  const tests = await fetch(getUserInput('url') + '/_api/get-tests');
  const parsed = await tests.json();
  assert.isTrue(parsed.length >= 5);
  parsed.forEach((test) => {
    assert.equal(test.state, 'passed');
  });
};
```
