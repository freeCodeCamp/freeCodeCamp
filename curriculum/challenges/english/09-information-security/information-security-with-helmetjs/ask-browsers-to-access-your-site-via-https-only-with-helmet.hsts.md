# --description--

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. If your website can be accessed via HTTPS you can ask userâ€™s browsers to avoid using insecure HTTP. By setting the header Strict-Transport-Security, you tell the browsers to use HTTPS for the future requests in a specified amount of time. This will work for the requests coming after the initial request.

# --instructions--

Configure `helmet.hsts()` to use HTTPS for the next 90 days. Pass the config object `{maxAge: timeInSeconds, force: true}`. You can create a variable `ninetyDaysInSeconds = 90*24*60*60;` to use for the `timeInSeconds`.

Note: Configuring HTTPS on a custom website requires the acquisition of a domain, and an SSL/TLS Certificate.

# --hints--

helmet.hsts() middleware should be mounted correctly

```js
  $.get(code + '/_api/app-info').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.include(data.appStack, 'hsts');
      assert.property(data.headers, 'strict-transport-security');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

maxAge should be equal to 7776000 s (90 days)

```js
  $.get(code + '/_api/app-info').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.match(
        data.headers['strict-transport-security'],
        /^max-age=7776000;?/
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
