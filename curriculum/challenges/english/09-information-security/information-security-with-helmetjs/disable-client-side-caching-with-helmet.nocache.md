# --description--

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

If you are releasing an update for your website, and you want the users to always download the newer version, you can (try to) disable caching on clientâ€™s browser. It can be useful in development too. Caching has performance benefits, which you will lose, so only use this option when there is a real need.

# --instructions--

Use the `helmet.noCache()` method on your server.

# --hints--

helmet.noCache() middleware should be mounted correctly

```js
  $.get(code + '/_api/app-info').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.include(data.appStack, 'nocache');
      assert.equal(
        data.headers['cache-control'],
        'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
