# --description--

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

`app.use(helmet())` will automatically include all the middleware introduced above, except `noCache()`, and `contentSecurityPolicy()`, but these can be enabled if necessary. You can also disable or configure any other middleware individually, using a configuration object.

**Example:**

```js
app.use(helmet({
  frameguard: {         // configure
    action: 'deny'
  },
  contentSecurityPolicy: {    // enable and configure
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ['style.com'],
    }
  },
  dnsPrefetchControl: false     // disable
}))
```

We introduced each middleware separately for teaching purposes and for ease of testing. Using the ‘parent’ `helmet()` middleware is easy to implement in a real project.

# --hints--

no tests - it's a descriptive challenge

```js
assert(true);
```
