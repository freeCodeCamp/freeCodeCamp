Hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express. `X-Powered-By: Express` is sent in every request coming from Express by default. Use the `helmet.hidePoweredBy()` middleware to remove the X-Powered-By header.

# --hints--

helmet.hidePoweredBy() middleware should be mounted correctly

```js
  $.get(code + '/_api/app-info').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.include(data.appStack, 'hidePoweredBy');
      assert.notEqual(data.headers['x-powered-by'], 'Express');
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
