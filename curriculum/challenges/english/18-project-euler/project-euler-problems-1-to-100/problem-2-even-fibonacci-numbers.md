# --description--

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

<div style='text-align: center;'>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</div>

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed `n`, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# --hints--

`fiboEvenSum(10)` should return a number.

```js
assert.isNumber(fiboEvenSum(10));
```

Your function should return an even value.
