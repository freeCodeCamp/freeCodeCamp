# --description--

A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}}$.

We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with $g=9.81 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$.

Find the volume (in $\text{m}^3$) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.

# --hints--

`firecracker()` should return `1856532.8455`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(firecracker(), 1856532.8455);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function firecracker() {

  return true;
}

firecracker();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
