# --description--

Phil the confectioner is making a new batch of chocolate covered candy. Each candy centre is shaped like an ellipsoid of revolution defined by the equation: $b^2x^2 + b^2y^2 + a^2z^2 = a^2b^2$.

Phil wants to know how much chocolate is needed to cover one candy centre with a uniform coat of chocolate one millimeter thick.

If $a = 1$ mm and $b = 1$ mm, the amount of chocolate required is $\frac{28}{3} \pi$ mm<sup>3</sup>

If $a = 2$ mm and $b = 1$ mm, the amount of chocolate required is approximately 60.35475635 mm<sup>3</sup>.

Find the amount of chocolate in mm<sup>3</sup> required if $a = 3$ mm and $b = 1$ mm. Give your answer as the number rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.

# --hints--

`chocolateCoveredCandy()` should return `103.37870096`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(chocolateCoveredCandy(), 103.37870096);
```
