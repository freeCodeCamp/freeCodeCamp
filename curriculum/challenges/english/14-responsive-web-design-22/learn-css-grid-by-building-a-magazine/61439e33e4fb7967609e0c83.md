# --description--

After the three `p` elements within your `.text` element, create a `blockquote` element. Within that, add an `hr` element, a `p` element with the `class` set to `quote`, and a second `hr` element.

Give the `.quote` element the text `The entire curriculum should be a series of projects`.

# --hints--

You should create a new `blockquote` element within your `.text` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('.text blockquote'));
```

Your `blockquote` element should come after your three `p` elements.

```js
assert(document.querySelector('.text')?.children?.[3]?.localName === 'blockquote');
```

Your `blockquote` element should have two `hr` elements.

```js
assert(document.querySelectorAll('.text blockquote hr')?.length === 2);
```

Your `blockquote` element should have a `p` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('.text blockquote p'));
```

Your `blockquote` children should be in the correct order.

```js
const children = document.querySelector('.text blockquote')?.children;
assert(children?.[0]?.localName === 'hr');
assert(children?.[1]?.localName === 'p');
assert(children?.[2]?.localName === 'hr');
```

Your new `p` element should have the `class` set to `quote`.

```js
assert(document.querySelector('.text blockquote p')?.className === 'quote');
```

Your new `p` element should have the text `The entire curriculum should be a series of projects`.

```js
assert(document.querySelector('.text blockquote p')?.innerText === 'The entire curriculum should be a series of projects');
```

          Soon the freeCodeCamp curriculum will be 100% project-driven learning. Instead of a series of coding challenges, you'll learn through building projects - step by step. Before we get into the details, let me emphasize: we are not changing the certifications. All 6 certifications will still have the same 5 required projects. We are only changing the optional coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          After years - years - of pondering these two problems and how to solve them, I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation! A vision! A picture in my head! A picture of this! This is what makes time travel possible: the flux capacitor!
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't as dramatic as Doc's revelation in Back to the Future. It
          just occurred to me while I was going for a run. The revelation: the entire curriculum should be a series of projects. Instead of individual coding challenges, we'll just have projects, each with their own seamless series of tests. Each test gives you just enough information to figure out how to get it to pass. (And you can view hints if that isn't enough.)
