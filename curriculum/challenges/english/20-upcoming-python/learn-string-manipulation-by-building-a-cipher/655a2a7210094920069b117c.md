# --description--

Comparison operators allow you to compare two objects based on their values. You can use a comparison operator by placing it between the objects you want to compare. They return a *Boolean* value — namely `True` or `False` — depending on the truthfulness of the expression.

Python has the following comparison operators:

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| == | Equal |
| != | Not equal |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| <= | Less than or equal to |

At the top of your loop, print the result of comparing `char` with an empty space. Use the equality operator `==` for that.

for char in text.lower():
    index = alphabet.find(char)    
    new_index = index + shift
    encrypted_text += alphabet[new_index]
    print('char:', char, 'encrypted text:', encrypted_text)
