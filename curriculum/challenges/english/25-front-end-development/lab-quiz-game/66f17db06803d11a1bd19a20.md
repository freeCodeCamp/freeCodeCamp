# --description--

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should create an array named `questions`.
1. The `questions` array should contain at least five objects, each having the keys `category`, `question`, `choices`, and `answer`.
1. The `category` key should have the value of a string representing a question category.
1. The `question` key should have the value of a string representing a question.
1. The `choices` key should have the value of an array containing three strings, which are alternative answers to the question.
1. The `answer` key should have the value of a string, representing the correct answer to the question. Also, the value of `answer` should be included in the `choices` array.
1. You should have a function named `getRandomQuestion` that takes an array of questions as a parameter and returns a random question object from the array.
1. You should have a function named `getRandomComputerChoice` that takes the array of the available choices as a parameter, and returns a random answer to the selected question.
1. You should have a function named `getResults` that takes the selected question object and the computer choice as its parameters and returns `The computer's choice is correct!` if the answer is correct. Otherwise, it returns `The computer's choice is wrong. The correct answer is: <correct-answer>`, where `<correct-answer>` is the value of the correct answer to the chosen question.

# --hints--

You should create an array named `questions`.

```js
assert.isArray(questions);
```

The `questions` array should contain at least five objects, each having the keys `category`, `question`, `choices`, and `answer`.

```js
assert.isAtLeast(questions.length, 5);
questions.forEach(question => {
    assert.isObject(question);
    assert.hasAllKeys(question, ['category', 'choices', 'question', 'answer']);
});

```

The `category` key should have the value of a string representing a question category.

```js
assert.isNotEmpty(questions);
questions.forEach(({category}) => assert.isString(category));
```

The `question` key should have the value of a string representing a question.

```js
assert.isNotEmpty(questions);
questions.forEach(({question}) => {
    assert.isString(question);
    assert.include(question, '?');
})
```

The `choices` key should have the value of an array containing three strings.

```js
assert.isNotEmpty(questions);
questions.forEach(({choices}) => {
    assert.isArray(choices);
    assert.lengthOf(choices, 3);
    choices.forEach(choice => assert.isString(choice));
})
```

The `answer` key should have the value of a string.

```js
assert.isNotEmpty(questions);
questions.forEach(({answer}) => assert.isString(answer));
```

The value of `answer` should be included in the `choices` array.

```js
assert.isNotEmpty(questions);
questions.forEach(({answer, choices}) => assert.oneOf(answer, choices));
```

You should have a function named `getRandomQuestion` that takes an array of questions as a parameter and returns a random question object from the array.

```js
const parameters = __helpers.getFunctionParams(getRandomQuestion.toString());

assert.isFunction(getRandomQuestion);
assert.lengthOf(parameters, 1);
assert.lengthOf(getRandomQuestion, 1);
assert.isObject(getRandomQuestion(questions));
assert.deepInclude(questions, getRandomQuestion(questions), "getRandomQuestion did not return one of the objects inside questions");
```

You should have a function named `getRandomComputerChoice` that takes the array of the available choices as a parameter, and returns a random answer to the selected question.

```js
assert.isFunction(getRandomComputerChoice);
const randomArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
assert.oneOf(getRandomComputerChoice(randomArray), randomArray)
```

You should have a function named `getResults`.

```js
assert.isFunction(getResults);
```

If the computer choice matches the answer, `getResults` should return `The computer's choice is correct!`

```js
assert.equal(getResults(questions[0], questions[0].answer), `The computer's choice is correct!`);
```

If the computer choice doesn't match the answer, `getResults` should return `The computer's choice is wrong. The correct answer is: <correct-answer>`, where `<correct-answer>` is the value of the correct answer to the chosen question.

```js
assert.equal(getResults({category: 'misc', choices: ['a', 'b', 'c'], question: "question?", answer: "b"}, "a"), `The computer's choice is wrong. The correct answer is: b`)
```
