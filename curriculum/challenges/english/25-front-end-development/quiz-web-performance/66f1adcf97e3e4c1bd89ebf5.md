### --question--

#### --text--

What is the key difference between real performance and perceived performance in web development?

#### --distractors--

Real performance focuses on the number of HTTP requests made by the browser, while perceived performance is based on CSS rendering speed.

---

Real performance is only about load times, while perceived performance relates to visual elements like animations and loading indicators.

---

Real performance only includes server-side processing times, while perceived performance is entirely client-side.

#### --answer--

Real performance is how fast content is loaded, while perceived performance is how quickly users believe the page loads.

The delay before a user can interact with any elements on the page.

---

The time taken for all stylesheets to fully load and apply.

#### --answer--

The time it takes for the first piece of text or image to render.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does reducing the number of critical resources affect web performance?

#### --distractors--

---

It reduces the overall size of the web page for better performance.

---

It makes the browser load images more quickly but doesn't impact other resources.

#### --answer--

It shortens the critical rendering path, leading to faster page rendering.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which statement best describes Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)?

#### --distractors--

It measures how quickly the page responds after user interactions.

---

Time spent waiting for JavaScript to execute.

---

The duration between content being painted and the page becoming interactive.

#### --answer--

The unexpected movement of web page elements during loading, affecting layout stability.

### --question--

#### --text--

What strategy can effectively enhance perceived performance?

#### --distractors--

Using large images to improve the overall visual quality.

---

Loading CSS styles last to prioritize content rendering.

---

Preloading all scripts to ensure they are ready when needed.

#### --answer--

Displaying a loading skeleton while content is being fetched.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the key performance benefit of utilizing a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?

#### --distractors--

It ensures all resources are loaded without delays.

---

It minimizes the use of CSS files, improving speed.

---

It eliminates the need for caching altogether.

#### --answer--

It reduces latency by serving content from geographically closer servers.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does optimizing CSS impact page performance?

#### --distractors--

It prevents the browser from executing unnecessary JavaScript.

---

It reduces the overall file size of images.

---

It eliminates the need for lazy loading images.

#### --answer--

It speeds up the parsing of HTML.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which metric assesses the stability of visual content on a web page?

#### --distractors--

---

Time to First Byte (TTFB)

---

Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

#### --answer--

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

### --question--

#### --text--

When measuring Interaction to Next Paint (INP), what is being evaluated?

#### --distractors--

The time it takes for the page to fully load all styles and images after a user interaction.

---

The delay between a user's interaction and the browser's ability to register the next user input.

---

The interval between JavaScript execution and the browser refreshing the page content.

#### --answer--

The time between a user's interaction and the browser responding by rendering the next frame.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which Web API is effective for measuring performance in JavaScript?

#### --distractors--

`window.getPerformanceStatistics()`

---

`document.performance()`

---

`window.performance.now()`

#### --answer--

`performance.now()`

### --question--

#### --text--

What is considered a good practice to enhance JavaScript performance?

#### --distractors--

Placing all JavaScript code in the `<head>` tag for immediate execution.

---

Using `eval()` to dynamically execute JavaScript code.

---

Adding multiple `setTimeout()` calls for handling asynchronous tasks.

#### --answer--

Utilizing event delegation to manage multiple events efficiently.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does the Critical Path Length affect page load times?

#### --distractors--

It increases the amount of data transferred during page load.

---

It complicates the loading process by introducing more JavaScript files.

---

It has no impact on how quickly a page loads.

#### --answer--

A shorter critical path allows the browser to render the page more quickly.

### --question--

#### --text--

In what way does lazy loading images enhance page performance?

#### --distractors--

It ensures all images load immediately for a better user experience.

---

It reduces the size of image files to speed up loading.

---

It preloads images to prevent any loading delays.

#### --answer--

It delays loading non-essential images until they are in view, improving initial load time.
