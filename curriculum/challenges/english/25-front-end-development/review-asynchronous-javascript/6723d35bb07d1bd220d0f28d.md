# --description--

Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

- **Synchronous JavaScript** is executed sequentially and waits for the previous operation to finish before moving on to the next one.
- **Asynchronous JavaScript** allows multiple operations to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread.
- **Thread** is a sequence of instructions that can be executed independently of the main program flow.
- **Callback functions** are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of the operation or as a result of an event.

## The JavaScript engine and JavaScript runtime

- The **JavaScript engine** is a program that executes JavaScript code in a web browser. It works like a converter that takes your code, turns it into instructions that the computer can understand and work accordingly. 
- V8 is an example of a JavaScript engine developed by Google.
- The **JavaScript runtime** is the environment in which JavaScript code is executed. It includes the JavaScript engine which processes and executes the code, and additional features like a web browser or Node.js.

## The fetch API

- The `fetch` API allows web apps to make network requests, typically to retrieve or send data to the server. It provides a `fetch()` method that you can use to make these requests.
- You can retrieve text, images, audio, JSON, and other types of data using the `fetch` API.

## HTTP methods for fetch API

The `fetch` API supports various HTTP methods to interact with the server. The most common methods are:

- **GET**: Used to retrieve data from the server. By default, the `fetch` API uses the `GET` method to retrieve data.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
```

To use the fetched data, it must be converted to JSON format using the `.json()` method:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

In this code, the response coming from the fetch API is a promise and the `.then` handler is converting the response to a JSON format.

- **POST**: Used to send data to the server. The `POST` method is used to create new resources on the server.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Doe',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  })
})
```

In this example, we're sending a `POST` request to create a new user. We have specified the method as `POST`, set the appropriate headers, and included a body with the data we want to send. The body needs to be a string, so we use `JSON.stringify()` to convert our object to a JSON string.

- **PUT**: Used to update data on the server. The `PUT` method is used to update existing resources on the server.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/45', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'John Smith',
    email: 'john@example.com'
  })
})
```

In this example, we are updating the ID `45` that is specified at the end of the URL. We have used the `PUT` method on the code and also specified the data as the body which will be used to update the identified data. 

- **DELETE**: Used to delete data on the server. The `DELETE` method is used to delete resources on the server.

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/users/45', {
  method: 'DELETE'
})
```

In this example, we're sending a `DELETE` request to remove a user with the ID `45`.

## Promise and promise chaining

- **Promises** are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. The value of the promise is known only when the `async` operation is completed.
- Here is an example to create a simple promise:
    
```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Data received successfully');
  }, 2000);
});
```

- The `.then()` method is used in a Promise to specify what should happen when the Promise is fulfilled, while `.catch()` is used to handle any errors that occur.
- Here is an example of using `.then()` and `.catch()` with a Promise:

```js
promise
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, the `.then()` method is used to log the data received from the Promise, while the `.catch()` method is used to log any errors that occur.

- **Promise chaining**: One of the powerful features of Promises is that we can chain multiple asynchronous operations together. Each `.then()` can return a new Promise, allowing you to perform a sequence of asynchronous operations one after the other.
- Here is an example of Promise chaining:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
    return fetch('https://api.example.com/other-data');
  })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(otherData => {
    console.log(otherData);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
```

In the above example, we first fetch data from one URL, then fetch data from another URL based on the first response, and finally log the second data received. 

The `catch` method would handle any errors that occur during the process. This means you don't need to add error handling to each step, which can greatly simplify your code.

## Using `async/await` to handle promises

Async/await makes writing & reading asynchronous code easier which is built on top of Promises.

- **async**: The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function. An `async` function returns a Promise, which resolves with the value returned by the `async` function.
- **await**: The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved. It can only be used inside an `async` function.
- Here is an example of using `async/await`:

```js
async function delayedGreeting(name) {
  console.log("A Messenger entered the chat...");
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

delayedGreeting("Alice");
console.log("First Printed Message!");
```

In the above example, the `delayedGreeting` function is an `async` function that pauses for 2 seconds before printing the greeting message. The `await` keyword is used to pause the function execution until the `Promise` is resolved.

- One of the biggest advantages of `async/await` is error handling via `try/catch` blocks. Here's an example:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

In the above example, the `try` block contains the code that might throw an error, and the `catch` block handles the error if it occurs. This makes error handling more straightforward and readable.

## The `async` attribute

- The `async` attribute tells the browser to download the script file asynchronously while continuing to parse the HTML document. 
- Once the script is downloaded, the HTML parsing is paused, the script is executed, and then HTML parsing resumes.
- You should use `async` for independent scripts where the order of execution doesn't matter

## The `defer` attribute

- The `defer` attribute also downloads the script asynchronously, but it defers the execution of the script until after the HTML document has been fully parsed. 
- The `defer` scripts maintain the order of execution as they appear in the HTML document.

- It's important to note that both `async` and `defer` attributes are ignored for inline scripts and only work for external script files.

- When both `async` and `defer` attributes are present, the `async` attribute takes precedence.

## Geolocation API 

- The Geolocation API provides a way for websites to request the user's location.

- The example below demonstrates the API's  `getCurrentPosition()` method which is used to get the user's current location.

```js
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
  (position) => {
    console.log("Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude);
    console.log("Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude);
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Error: " + error.message);
  }
);
```

In this code, we're calling `getCurrentPosition` and passing it a function which will be called when the position is successfully obtained. 

The `position` object contains a variety of information, but here we have selected `latitude` and `longitude` only.

If there is an issue with getting the `position`, then the error will be logged to the console. 

- It is important to respect the user's privacy and only request their location when necessary.
