What is the `z-index` property, and how does it work to control the stacking of positioned elements?

The `z-index` property in CSS is used to control the vertical stacking order of positioned elements that overlap on the page. When multiple elements are stacked on top of each other, the `z-index` value determines which element appears on top. The higher the `z-index` value, the closer the element is to the viewer, while lower values place the element farther back in the stack.

However, the `z-index` only works on elements that are positioned, which means the element must have a position value other than `static`, such as `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`. The default `z-index` value is `auto`, which places the element in the default stacking order. Let's take a look at an example with three boxes:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="box1">Box 1</div>
  <div class="box2">Box 2</div>
  <div class="box3">Box 3</div>
</div>
```

Now, we can apply some styles to position the boxes to overlap on each other like this:

```css
.container {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: 300px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.box1 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  background: lightcoral;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.box2 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 3;
  background: gold;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}

.box3 {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
  background: lightgreen;
  top: 60px;
  left: 60px;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

For the container, the positioning will be set to `relative` and all of the boxes nested inside will be set to `absolute` positioning. Each box has a different value for the `z-index` which results in the boxes being layered on top of each other.

You can think of `z-index` as a way to create layers on a webpage, and elements with higher `z-index` values will be placed above those with lower values. This is especially useful for controlling how overlapping elements behave in complex layouts, such as modals, pop-ups, or tooltips.
