What is fixed and sticky positioning, and how does it differ from absolute positioning?

Fixed and sticky positioning are two important CSS positioning strategies, each offering distinct behaviors compared to absolute positioning. When an element is positioned with `position: fixed`, it is removed from the normal document flow and placed relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same position even when the user scrolls. This is often used for elements like headers or navigation bars that need to remain visible at all times. For example, if you want a heading to stay fixed at the top of the page, you can use the following code:

```css
h1 {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 500px;
  background: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

In this example, the `h1` element will stick to the top of the viewport, and even when the user scrolls, it will remain in place. This is especially useful for creating persistent UI elements, like sticky headers or always-visible navigation.

`position: sticky` behaves as a hybrid between relative and fixed positioning. Initially, the element behaves as though it's positioned relatively, staying within the flow of the document. However, once the user scrolls the element past a certain point, it "sticks" to the viewport (usually the top) and behaves as though it is fixed. This is great for creating elements like sticky navigation bars, which only become fixed once the user scrolls to a certain position. Here's how you can apply sticky positioning:

```css
.positioned {
  position: sticky;
  top: 30px;
  left: 30px;
}
```

In this example, the `.positioned` element will behave normally until the user scrolls it `30px` away from the top, at which point it will "stick" to the top of the viewport.

Here are some key differences between absolute, fixed and sticky positioning:

- Absolute positioning removes an element from the document flow and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, or the initial containing block if none exists. The element stays in that position regardless of scrolling.
- Fixed positioning also removes the element from the document flow but fixes it relative to the viewport, meaning it will stay visible in the same spot even as the page is scrolled.
- Sticky positioning keeps the element in the normal flow initially but allows it to stick in place after scrolling past a defined threshold.

These strategies allow you to create layouts that include floating elements, sticky headers, and more dynamic UI components, enhancing user experience by making important information always accessible.
