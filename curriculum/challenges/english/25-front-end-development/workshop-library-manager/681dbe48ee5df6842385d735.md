# --description--

The rest of the objects representing the books have been filled in for you. 

Now would be a good time to start working on displaying the book information in the console. Over the next few steps, you will learn how to work with the `map()` method to achieve this goal.

assert.match(code, /console\.log\(("|')Books\s+in\s+the\s+Library:\\n\1\);?/);
```
