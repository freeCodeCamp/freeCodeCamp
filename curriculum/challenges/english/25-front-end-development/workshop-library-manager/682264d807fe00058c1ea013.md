# --description--

For the next part of the workshop, you will focus on displaying a list of book summaries to the console.

Begin by logging the message `"\nList of book summaries:\n"` to the console. The newline character is added here because there should be a space before and after the message here.

# --hints--

You should log the message `"\nList of book summaries:\n"` to the console.

```js
assert.match(code, /console\.log\(("|')\\nList\s+of\s+book\s+summaries:\\n\1\);?/);
```
