# --description--

A leap year is a year that is divisible by `4`, except for years that are divisible by `100` and not divisible by `400`. For example, `2000` is a leap year, but `1900` is not. Also, a leap year has an extra day in February, which is the 29th day of the month.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. Define a function called `isLeapYear` that takes a number as an argument.
2. Outside the function, declare a variable `year` that stores the value of the year you want to check.
3. Inside the function, use an `if/ else` statement or a ternary operator to check if the year is a leap year.
4. To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions:

   - If the year is divisible by `4`, then it is a leap year.
   - Unless the year is also divisible by `100`, then it is not a leap year.
   - Unless the year is also divisible by `400`, then it is a leap year.

5. If the year is a leap year, return `[year] is a leap year.`. Otherwise, return `[year] is not a leap year.`. You will replace `[year]` with the parameter defined in the `isLeapYear` function.
6. You should call the `isLeapYear` function with `year` as the argument and assign the result to a variable named `result`.
7. You should output the `result` variable to the console using `console.log()`.

# --hints--

You should define a function named `isLeapYear`.

```js
assert.isFunction(isLeapYear);
```

The `isLeapYear` function should take a number as an argument.

```js
assert.match(isLeapYear.toString(), /\s*isLeapYear\(\s*\w+\s*\)/);
```

You should declare a variable `year` and assign it a value to check if it is a leap year.

```js
assert.isDefined(year);
```

The `year` variable shouldn't be empty.

```js
assert.isNotNull(year);
```

With `2024` as the value of the `year` variable, the `result` should be `2024 is a leap year.`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(2024), '2024 is a leap year.');
```

With `2000` as the value of the `year` variable, the `result` should be `2000 is a leap year.`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(2000), '2000 is a leap year.');
```

With `1900` as the value of the `year` variable, the `result` should be `1900 is not a leap year.`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(isLeapYear(1900), '1900 is not a leap year.');

```

You should call the `isLeapYear` function and pass `year` as a parameter.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /isLeapYear\(\s*year\s*\)/);
```

You should store the result of calling the `isLeapYear` function in a variable named `result`.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /(?:var|let|const)\s+result\s*=\s*isLeapYear\(\s*year\s*\)/);
```

You should output the `result` to the console using `console.log()`.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /console\.log\(\s*result\s*\)/);
```

# --solutions--

```js
function isLeapYear(year) {
  if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0) {
    return(year + " is a leap year.");
  } else {
    return(year + " is not a leap year.");
  }
}

const year = 2024;
const result = isLeapYear(year);
console.log(result);
```
