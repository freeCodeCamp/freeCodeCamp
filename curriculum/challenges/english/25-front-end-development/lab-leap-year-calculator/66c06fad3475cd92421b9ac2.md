**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab. 

**User Stories:**

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year, but 1900 is not. Also, a leap year has an extra day in February, which is the 29th day of the month.

1. Declare a variable `year` that stores the value of the year to check.

1. Use an `if/ else` statement to check if the year is a leap year.

1. To check if the year is a leap year, fulfill the following conditions in the `if` part of the statement:
   
- If the year is divisible by 4, then it is a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year.
- If the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

1. If the year is a leap year, output `[year] is a leap year.` to the console. Otherwise, output `[year] is not a leap year.`. You will replace [year] with the year variable.

let year = 2024;

if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || year % 400 === 0) {
  console.log(year + " is a leap year.");
} else {
  console.log(year + " is not a leap year.");
}
