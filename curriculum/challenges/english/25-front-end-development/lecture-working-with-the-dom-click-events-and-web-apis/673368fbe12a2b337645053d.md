What is the `Event` object?

The `Event` object is a payload that triggers when a user interacts with your web page in some way. These interactions can be anything from clicking on a button or focusing an input to shaking their mobile device.

Like all JavaScript objects, the `Event` object has a number of properties that might be helpful. The properties available depend on the event that triggered this payload.

All `Event` objects will have the `type` property. This property reveals the type of event that triggered the payload, such as `"keydown"` or `"click"`. These values will correspond to the same values you might pass to `addEventListener()`, where you can capture and utilize the `Event` object.

`Event` objects will always have the `target` property. The `target` property is a reference to whatever object triggered the event. Most commonly, this will be some sort of `HTMLElement` object, or the `Document` or `Window` objects. But it can also be something more specific, like an `AudioContext`.

Events also have methods, which are functions exposed as properties on the object. One commonly used method is `preventDefault()`, which prevents the default behavior of the event when called.

If you want to handle form submissions yourself, for example, you might call `preventDefault()` to keep the browser from trying to submit the form data as a `POST` request. You will learn more about `POST` requests in future lecture videos.

You'll also likely run in to the `stopPropagation()` method. This method prevents the event from bubbling up or propagating to parent elements. You'll learn more about what this means in a later lecture.

There are also a large number of properties that are specific to certain implementations of the `Event` object. For example, a `FetchEvent` will have a request property to contain the request that triggered the event. 

If you are ever unsure of what properties are available, you can log the `Event` object in question or even check the documentation.
