How do you add attributes with `setAttribute()`?

You have been used to working with attributes in your HTML and CSS projects. But did you know that you can add attributes to your HTML elements in your JavaScript file?

In this lecture, you will learn how work with the `setAttribute()` method to add attributes to your HTML elements.

Here is the basic syntax:

```js
setAttribute(attribute, value);
```

Let's take a look at a few examples to better understand how to use the `setAttribute()` method.

In this first example, we have a `p` element inside the HTML:

```html
<p id="para">I am a paragraph</p>
```

To add a `class` attribute we first need to access that `p` element using the `getElementById()` method. Then we can use the `setAttribute()` method to add the `class` attribute and set the value to `my-class`:

```js
const para = document.getElementById("para");
para.setAttribute("class", "my-class");
```

If we inspect the element inside the browser, we will see that the `class` attribute has been added to the `p` element.

If you have an existing attribute on an HTML element, you can update its value using the `setAttribute()` method.

In this example we have a `div` element with a `class` attribute set to `my-class`:

```html
<div class="my-class"></div>
```

To update the `class` attribute value to example, we can use the `setAttribute()` method again:

```js
const divEl = document.querySelector(".my-class");
divEl.setAttribute("class", "example");
```

If we inspect the element inside the browser, we will see that the `class` attribute value has been updated to example.

So, what are some real-world examples of when to use the `setAttribute()` method?

If you were building a dynamic image gallery, you might need to update the `src` attribute of an image element when a user clicks on a thumbnail.

Another example would be if you dealing with form validation and need to add certain attributes like `required` or `minlength` to an `input` element.
