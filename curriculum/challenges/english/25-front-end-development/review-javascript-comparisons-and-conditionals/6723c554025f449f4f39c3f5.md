Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## Comparisons and the `null` and `undefined` Data Types

- **Comparisons and `undefined`**: A variable is `undefined` when it has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It's the default value of uninitialized variables and function parameters that weren't provided an argument. `undefined` converts to `NaN` in numeric contexts, which makes all numeric comparisons with `undefined` return `false`.

```js
console.log(undefined > 0);  // false
console.log(undefined < 0);  // false
console.log(undefined == 0); // false
```

- **Comparisons and `null`**: The `null` type represents the intentional absence of a value. When using the equality operator, `null` and `undefined` are considered equal. However, when using the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks both value and type without performing type coercion, `null` and `undefined` are not equal:

```js
console.log(null == undefined); // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

## `switch` Statements

- **Definition**: A `switch` statement evaluates an expression and matches its value against a series of `case` clauses. When a match is found, the code block associated with that case is executed. A `break` statement should be placed at the end of each case, to terminate its execution and continue with the next. The `default` case is an optional case and only executes if none of the other cases match. The `default` case is placed at the end of a `switch` statement.

```js
const dayOfWeek = 3; 

switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case 1:
    console.log("It's Monday! Time to start the week strong.");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("It's Tuesday! Keep the momentum going.");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("It's Wednesday! We're halfway there.");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("It's Thursday! Almost the weekend.");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("It's Friday! The weekend is near.");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("It's Saturday! Enjoy your weekend.");
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("It's Sunday! Rest and recharge.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day! Please enter a number between 1 and 7.");
}
```
