What is bracket notation and how do you access characters from a string?

In JavaScript, strings are treated as sequences of characters, and each character in a string can be accessed using bracket notation. This allows you to retrieve a specific character from a string based on its position, which is called its index.

An index is the position of a character within a string, and it is zero-based. This means that the first character of a string has an index of `0`, the second character has an index of `1`, and so on.

For example, in the string `hello`, the character `h` is at index `0`, `e` is at index `1`, `l` is at index `2`, and so on.

Bracket notation uses square brackets (`[]`) and the index of the character you want to access. Letâ€™s look at an example:

```js
let greeting = "hello";
console.log(greeting[1]); // Output: "e"
```

In this example, we can access the character at index `1`, which is `e`.

To get the last character of a string, you can use the length of the string minus one.
The `length` property of a string tells you how many characters it contains, so to access the last character, you would subtract one from the length:

```js
let greeting = "hello";
console.log(greeting[greeting.length - 1]); // Output: "o"
```

In this case, the `length` of `hello` is `5`, and the last character (`o`) is at index `4` which is `5 - 1`.

If you want to get multiple characters, you can use bracket notation like this:

```js
let greeting = "hello";
let firstTwo = greeting[0] + greeting[1]; // Output: "he"
console.log(firstTwo);
```

In this example, we are concatenating the first and second characters using bracket notation to form the string `he`.

Bracket notation is useful when you need to access specific characters in a string, such as extracting initials from a name or checking a specific letter for validation.
