How do you create a newline in strings and escape strings in JavaScript?

When working with strings in JavaScript, there are times when you need to include special characters that the JavaScript engine might otherwise misinterpret.

Two common tasks involve creating a newline within a string and escaping certain characters (like quotes) to make sure they appear correctly.

In many programming languages, including JavaScript, you can create a newline in a string using a special character called an escape sequence. The most common escape sequence for newlines is `\n`.

For example, if you want to break a string into multiple lines, you would use `\n` where you want the new line to begin:

```js
let poem = "Roses are red,\nViolets are blue,\nJavaScript is fun,\nAnd so are you.";
console.log(poem);
```

The output will be:

```md
Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
JavaScript is fun,
And so are you.
```

The `\n` escape sequence tells JavaScript to insert a line break at that point, which results in the string being displayed across multiple lines.

Another important concept when working with strings is escaping characters. Sometimes, you need to include characters in your string that JavaScript normally uses for something else, such as quotes.

If you simply use quotes inside a string without escaping them, it can cause an error because JavaScript will think you're trying to end the string.

For example, this will cause an error:

```js
let statement = "She said, "Hello!"";
```

JavaScript gets confused because it thinks the string ends after the word `"said,"` but, you want the quotes around `"Hello!"` to be part of the string.

To fix this, you can escape the inner quotes by placing a backslash (`\`) before them:

```js
let statement = "She said, \"Hello!\"";
console.log(statement); // Output: She said, "Hello!"
```

The backslash tells JavaScript to treat the quotes as literal characters, so they appear correctly in the output.

You can also escape other special characters, such as the backslash itself (`\\`), or single quotes within a string surrounded by single quotes (`\'`).

Here's another example using single quotes:

```js
let quote = 'It\'s a beautiful day!';
console.log(quote); // Output: It's a beautiful day!
```

By escaping the single quote with `\'`, JavaScript knows to include it as part of the string rather than ending the string early.

Escaping and creating newlines are essential when youâ€™re formatting output or handling special characters in strings. These techniques help you prevent errors and ensure your text appears exactly as intended.
