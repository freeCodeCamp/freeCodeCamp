You may have seen links like `/public/logo.png`, `./script.js`, or `../styles.css` before. But what do these special types of links mean? These are called file paths. There are three key syntaxes to know. First is the slash, which can be a backslash (`\`) or forward slash (`/`) depending on your operating system. The second is the single dot (`.`). And finally, we have the double dot (`..`).

The slash is known as the "path separator". It is used to indicate a break in the text between folder or file names. This is how your computer knows that `naomis-files/` points to a directory of that same name, while `naomis/files/` points to a `files` directory in the `naomis` directory.

A single dot points to the current directory, and two dots point to the parent directory. You will typically see a single dot used to ensure that the path is recognized as a relative path. Remember that you learned in a previous lecture about relative versus absolute paths before.

Double dots, however, are much more common to access files outside of the current working directory.

For example, given this file tree:

```sh
my-app/
├─ public/
│  ├─ favicon.ico
│  ├─ index.html
├─ src/
│  ├─ index.css
│  ├─ index.js
```

If your `public/index.html` file needed to load the `favicon.ico` file, you would use a relative path with a single dot to access the current directory: `./favicon.ico`. If your `public/index.html` file needed to load the `index.css` file, you would use a relative path with double dots to navigate to the parent `my-app` directory first, then to the `src` directory, and finally to your file: `../src/index.css`.
