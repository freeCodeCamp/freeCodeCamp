## Introduction to Relational Databases

- **Relational Databases**: Organize data into related tables made of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.
- **Advantages of Relational Databases**: Scalable, widely applicable across domains (e.g., healthcare, business, gaming), and structured to maintain reliable data.
- **Common Use Cases**: Web development, inventory systems, e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Schema**: A relational database requires a schema that defines its structure—tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each row in a table. They are essential for data integrity and are used to relate records between tables via foreign keys.
- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in another table, used to link related data across tables.
- **Relationships**: By connecting tables through primary and foreign keys, you can structure normalized data and perform meaningful queries.
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Visualize how entities (tables) relate to each other in a database schema.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced using keys and data types. Ensures consistency and accuracy of stored data.

## SQL Basics

- **Queries**: Requests to retrieve specific data from the database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age < 3;
```

- **WHERE clause**: Filter results based on conditions. Use comparison operators like `<`, `=`, `>`, etc.
- **Select with ORDER BY**: Retrieve and sort results based on a column.

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
```

## Table Operations

- **`CREATE TABLE` Statement**: This statement is used to create a new table in a database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE first_table();
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` Statement**: This statement is used to add a column to an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
```

- **`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` Statement**: This statement is used to drop a column from an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

- **`ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` Statement**: This statement is used to rename a column in a table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
```

- **`DROP TABLE` Statement**: This statement is used to drop an entire table from the database.

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- **`ALTER DATABASE RENAME` Statement**: This statement is used to rename a database.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;
```

- **`DROP DATABASE` Statement**: This statement is used to drop an entire database.

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

## Constraints & Data Integrity

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with Constraint**: This statement is used to add a column with a constraint to an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT;
```

- **`NOT NULL` Constraint**: This constraint ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.

```sql
column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY` Statement**: This statement is used to add a primary key constraint to a table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);
```

- **`ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT` Statement**: This statement is used to drop a constraint from a table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with Foreign Key**: This statement is used to add a foreign key column that references another table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD UNIQUE` Statement**: This statement is used to add a UNIQUE constraint to a column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL` Statement**: This statement is used to set a NOT NULL constraint on an existing column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;
```

- **`INSERT` Statement with NULL Values**: This statement demonstrates how to insert NULL values into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_a) VALUES(NULL);
-- or
INSERT INTO table_name(column_b) VALUES('value'); -- if column_a allows nulls
```

- **Composite Primary Key**: This constraint defines a primary key that consists of multiple columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE course_enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

## Data Manipulation (CRUD)

- **`INSERT` Statement**: This statement is used to insert a single row into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
```

- **`INSERT` Statement with Omitted Columns**: This statement demonstrates inserting data without specifying column names.

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs VALUES ('Gino', 3);
```

- **`INSERT` Statement with Multiple Rows**: This statement is used to insert multiple rows into a table in a single operation.

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs (name, age) VALUES 
('Gino', 3),
('Nora', 2);
```

- **`UPDATE` Statement**: This statement is used to update existing data in a table based on a condition.

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;
```

- **`DELETE` Statement**: This statement is used to delete rows from a table based on a condition.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## Data Types

- **`NUMERIC` Data Type**: This data type is used to store precise decimal numbers with a specified precision and scale.

```sql
price NUMERIC(10, 2)
```

- **`TEXT` Data Type**: This data type is used to store variable-length character strings with no specific length limit.

```sql
column_name TEXT
```

- **`INTEGER` Data Type**: This data type is used to store whole numbers without decimal places.

```sql
units_sold INTEGER
```

- **`SMALLINT` and `BIGINT` Data Types**: These are variants of INTEGER with smaller and larger ranges respectively.

- **`SERIAL` Data Type**: This data type is used to create auto-incrementing integer columns in PostgreSQL.

```sql
id SERIAL
```

- **`AUTO_INCREMENT` Attribute**: This attribute is used in MySQL to create auto-incrementing integer columns.

```sql
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
```

- **`VARCHAR` Data Type**: This data type is used to store variable-length character strings with a specified maximum length.

```sql
name VARCHAR(50)
```

- **`DATE` Data Type**: This data type is used to store date values (year, month, day).

```sql
event_date DATE
```

- **`TIME` Data Type**: This data type is used to store time values (hour, minute, second).

```sql
start_time TIME
```

- **`TIMESTAMP` Data Type**: This data type is used to store date and time values, optionally with time zone information.

```sql
event_timestamp TIMESTAMP
event_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

- **`BOOLEAN` Data Type**: This data type is used to store true/false values.

```sql
is_active BOOLEAN
```

## Database Relationships

- **Types of Relationships**: These are the different ways tables can be related to each other in a relational database.
  - One-to-one
  - One-to-many
  - Many-to-one
  - Many-to-many
  - Self-referencing (recursive)

- **One-to-One Relationship**: This relationship type means that each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table.

```md
One employee is assigned exactly one vehicle.
Tables: employees, vehicles
```

- **One-to-Many Relationship**: This relationship type means that one record in a table can be associated with multiple records in another table.

```md
One customer can have many orders.
Tables: customers → orders
```

- **Many-to-Many Relationship via Junction Table**: This relationship type is implemented using a junction table that contains foreign keys from both related tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books_authors (
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id)
);
```

- **Self-Referencing Relationships**: This relationship type occurs when a table references itself, creating a hierarchical structure.

```md
An employee table where each employee may report to another employee.
```

## Advanced SQL (Joins)

- **`INNER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
INNER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`FULL OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows from either table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
FULL OUTER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`LEFT OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
LEFT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`RIGHT OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
RIGHT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`SELF JOIN` Statement**: This join is used to join a table with itself to compare rows within the same table.

```sql
SELECT A.column_name, B.column_name
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B ON A.related_column = B.related_column;
```

- **`CROSS JOIN` Statement**: This join returns the Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

## PostgreSQL Specific Commands

- **`psql` Login Command**: This command is used to log in to PostgreSQL with specific username and database.

```bash
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres
```

- **`\l` Command**: This command lists all databases in the PostgreSQL instance.

```sql
\l
```

- **`CREATE DATABASE` and `\c` Commands**: These commands are used to create a new database and connect to it.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
\c database_name
```

- **`\d` Command**: This command lists all tables in the current database.

```sql
\d
```

- **`\d table_name` Command**: This command displays the schema/structure of a specific table.

```sql
\d table_name
```

- **`\q` Command**: This command exits the PostgreSQL client.

```bash
\q
```

## Relational vs Non-Relational

- **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases**: Store unstructured or semi-structured data. Do not require a rigid schema and are more flexible for evolving data models.
- **Choosing Between Relational and Non-Relational**: Depends on the nature of your data and application requirements.
- **Relational vs Non-Relational**: Choose relational for structured data and consistency; NoSQL for flexibility and fast-changing data.

## Popular RDBMS Systems

- **MySQL**: Open-source, reliable, widely used in web development, supported by a large community.
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, advanced, extensible. Supports custom data types and server-side programming.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based, serverless. Ideal for small applications.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Proprietary, enterprise-grade database.
- **Oracle Database**: Commercial RDBMS known for large-scale performance and scalability.

## Best Practices

- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `delivery_orders`) for table and column names.
