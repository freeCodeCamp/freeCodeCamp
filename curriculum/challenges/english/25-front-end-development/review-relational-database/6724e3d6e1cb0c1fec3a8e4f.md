# Relational Database Review

## Introduction to Relational Databases

- **Relational Databases**: Organize data into related tables made of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.
- **Advantages of Relational Databases**: Scalable, widely applicable across domains (e.g., healthcare, business, gaming), and structured to maintain reliable data.
- **Common Use Cases**: Web development, inventory systems, e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Schema**: A relational database requires a schema that defines its structure—tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each row in a table. They are essential for data integrity and are used to relate records between tables via foreign keys.
- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in another table, used to link related data across tables.
- **Relationships**: By connecting tables through primary and foreign keys, you can structure normalized data and perform meaningful queries.
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Visualize how entities (tables) relate to each other in a database schema.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced using keys and data types. Ensures consistency and accuracy of stored data.

## SQL Basics

- **Queries**: Requests to retrieve specific data from the database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age < 3;
```

- **WHERE clause**: Filter results based on conditions. Use comparison operators like `<`, `=`, `>`, etc.
- **Select with ORDER BY**: Retrieve and sort results based on a column.

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
```

## Table Operations

- **Create a new table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE first_table();
```

- **Add a column to a table**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
```

- **Drop a column from a table**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

- **Rename a column**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
```

- **Drop a table**:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- **Rename a database**:

```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;
```

- **Drop a database**:

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

## Constraints & Data Integrity

- **Add a column with a constraint**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT;
```

- **NOT NULL constraint**:

```sql
column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
```

- **Add a primary key to a table**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY(column_name);
```

- **Drop a constraint**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

- **Add a foreign key column**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);
```

- **Add a UNIQUE constraint**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);
```

- **Set NOT NULL on a column**:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;
```

- **Insert NULL values**:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_a) VALUES(NULL);
-- or
INSERT INTO table_name(column_b) VALUES('value'); -- if column_a allows nulls
```

- **Composite Primary Key**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE course_enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

## Data Manipulation (CRUD)

- **Insert a single row into a table**:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
```

- **Omitting columns in INSERT**:

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs VALUES ('Gino', 3);
```

- **Insert multiple rows**:

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs (name, age) VALUES 
('Gino', 3),
('Nora', 2);
```

- **Update data conditionally**:

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column_name=new_value WHERE condition;
```

- **Delete rows with a condition**:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

## Data Types

- **NUMERIC**:

```sql
price NUMERIC(10, 2)
```

- **TEXT datatype**:

```sql
column_name TEXT
```

- **INTEGER**:

```sql
units_sold INTEGER
```

- **SMALLINT / BIGINT**: Variants of INTEGER with smaller/larger ranges.
- **SERIAL**:

```sql
id SERIAL
```

- **AUTO_INCREMENT (MySQL)**:

```sql
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
```

- **VARCHAR**:

```sql
name VARCHAR(50)
```

- **DATE**:

```sql
event_date DATE
```

- **TIME**:

```sql
start_time TIME
```

- **TIMESTAMP**:

```sql
event_timestamp TIMESTAMP
event_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

- **BOOLEAN**:

```sql
is_active BOOLEAN
```

## Database Relationships

- **Types of Relationships**:
  - One-to-one
  - One-to-many
  - Many-to-one
  - Many-to-many
  - Self-referencing (recursive)

- **One-to-One Example**:

```md
One employee is assigned exactly one vehicle.
Tables: employees, vehicles
```

- **One-to-Many Example**:

```md
One customer can have many orders.
Tables: customers → orders
```

- **Many-to-Many via Junction Table**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books_authors (
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id)
);
```

- **Self-Referencing Relationships**:

```md
An employee table where each employee may report to another employee.
```

## Advanced SQL (Joins)

- **INNER JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
INNER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **FULL OUTER JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
FULL OUTER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **LEFT OUTER JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
LEFT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
RIGHT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **SELF JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT A.column_name, B.column_name
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B ON A.related_column = B.related_column;
```

- **CROSS JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

## PostgreSQL Specific Commands

- **Log in to PostgreSQL**:

```bash
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres
```

- **List all databases**:

```sql
\l
```

- **Create and connect to a database**:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
\c database_name
```

- **List all tables**:

```sql
\d
```

- **View table schema**:

```sql
\d table_name
```

- **Exit PostgreSQL client**:

```bash
\q
```

## Relational vs Non-Relational

- **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases**: Store unstructured or semi-structured data. Do not require a rigid schema and are more flexible for evolving data models.
- **Choosing Between Relational and Non-Relational**: Depends on the nature of your data and application requirements.
- **Relational vs Non-Relational**: Choose relational for structured data and consistency; NoSQL for flexibility and fast-changing data.

## Popular RDBMS Systems

- **MySQL**: Open-source, reliable, widely used in web development, supported by a large community.
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, advanced, extensible. Supports custom data types and server-side programming.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based, serverless. Ideal for small applications.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Proprietary, enterprise-grade database.
- **Oracle Database**: Commercial RDBMS known for large-scale performance and scalability.

## Best Practices

- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `delivery_orders`) for table and column names.
