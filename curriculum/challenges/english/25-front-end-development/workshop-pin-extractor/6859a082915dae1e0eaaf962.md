# --description--

Finally, return `secret_codes`, then uncomment the function call and update the argument to be `[poem, poem2, poem3]`. Now your function works with multiple poems at once, and can extract multiple pins!

The `pin_extractor` function is completed.

# --hints--

The function should return `secret_codes` at the end.

```js
({
    test: () => runPython(`
    assert _Node(_code).find_function('pin_extractor').has_return('secret_codes')
    `)
})
```

You should have the function call `print(pin_extractor([poem, poem2, poem3]))`.

```js
({
    test: () => runPython(`
    assert _Node(_code).has_call('print(pin_extractor([poem, poem2, poem3]))')
    `)
})
```

`pin_extractor([poem, poem2, poem3])` should return `['5202', '3346', '50000']`.

```js
({
    test: () => runPython(`
    assert pin_extractor([poem, poem2, poem3]) == ['5202', '3346', '50000']
    `)
})
```

The function should work correctly with other lists of poems.

```js
({
    test: () => runPython(`
plum = '''In dusky shade the plum tree grew,
Its branches bent with evening dew.
A single fruit, so ripe and round,
Falls softly to the waiting ground.'''
apple = '''Red or green on branches high,
Like lanterns hung against the sky.
Crisp with autumn's golden breath,
A bite that wakes the world from death.'''
grape = '''Clustered tight on winding vines,
Bathed in sun where silence shines.
Jewel-toned beads in twilight air,
A whispered promise hanging there.'''
assert pin_extractor([plum, apple, grape]) == ['2863', '3885', '9227']
    `)
})
```
