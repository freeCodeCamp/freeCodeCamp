What is A/B testing?

Most of you have a select group of websites that you visit every day. This might include sites like Twitter, Discord, or freeCodeCamp. But have you ever wondered why you often see small changes to the design of your most frequently visited pages? Well, this doesn't happen by accident.

Companies spend a lot of time analyzing site analytics and studying user behavior. They do this to identify pain points in the user experience for their site or application. These companies then use that data to come up with solutions to create a smoother user experience.

One of the techniques companies employ is called A/B testing. This type of testing involves comparing two versions of a page or application and studying which version performs better. Sometimes, this type of testing is known as bucket or split testing.

Let's take a look at an example so you can better understand the concept. Imagine you have a landing page with some introductory text and a CTA (call to action) button. Remember that a CTA button is used to encourage users to perform a specific action, like donate or log in.

As you go through the site analytics, you realize that the click-through rate for the CTA is low. So you try redesigning that button so it's more prominent on the page. You increase the size of the button and change the button color from blue to green. To actually see if those changes made a difference, you can use A/B testing.

You can randomly divide your users into two groups. Group A is the control group, which sees the original version of the page with the  smaller blue button, while group B is the experimental group, which see the new version of the page with the larger green button. If the new version of the page results in a higher click-through rate, then you can confidently replace the old button styling with the new one.

Examples of tools to use for A/B testing include GrowthBook and LaunchDarkly.

There are many common use cases for A/B testing like testing ads, email campaigns, or new product features. A/B testing allows you to make more data-driven decisions and continually improve the user experience.
