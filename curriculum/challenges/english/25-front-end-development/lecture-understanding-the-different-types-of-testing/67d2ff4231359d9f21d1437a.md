What is end-to-end testing?

End-to-end testing, or E2E for short, tests real-world scenarios from the user's perspective. Examples of E2E testing scenarios include testing the registration and login process or testing the checkout for an e-commerce site.

To better understand how end-to-end testing works, let's take a look at a real-world example from the freeCodeCamp codebase. This example uses Playwright, a popular end-to-end testing framework developed by Microsoft.

Inside the freeCodeCamp codebase, there is a directory called e2e which holds tests for donations, certifications, exams and more. Inside the directory, there is a donate-page-donor.spec.ts file which has tests for the authenticated donor supporter page.

The first step is to navigate to the donation page as a demo user who is already a supporter:

test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  execSync("node ./tools/scripts/seed/seed-demo-user --set-true isDonating");
  await page.goto("/donate");
});

Since there are multiple tests in this file, the beforeEach hook will run before each of the tests.

Once the user is on the donation page, they will see a thank you message with suggestions on how to support freeCodeCamp further. Here are just a few of the tests to check for some of the text found on the donation page:

test("should render the donate page correctly", async ({ page }) => {
  await expect(
    page.getByText("Thank you for your continued support")
  ).toBeVisible();

  await expect(
    page.getByText(
      "Your contributions are crucial in creating resources that empower millions of people to learn new skills and support their families."
    )
  ).toBeVisible();
...
});

There are also tests to check that the donor has a supporter link in the menu bar, as well as a special stylized border around their avatar to indicate they are a supporter:

test("The menu should have a supporters link", async ({ page }) => {
  const menuButton = page.getByTestId("header-menu-button");
  const menu = page.getByTestId("header-menu");

  await expect(menuButton).toBeVisible();
  await menuButton.click();

  await expect(menu).toBeVisible();

  await expect(page.getByRole("link", { name: "Supporters" })).toBeVisible();
});

test("The Avatar should have a special border for donors", async ({ page }) => {
  const container = page.locator(".avatar-container");
  await expect(container).toHaveClass("avatar-container gold-border");
});

By having these types of detailed tests, you can increase the test coverage for your application beyond just unit tests. End-to-end tests also help ensure that your application behaves correctly, and is predictable for users. Examples of other end-to-end testing tools include Cypress, Selenium, and Puppeteer.

While end-to-end testing is important, it is expensive because it is time-consuming to set up, design, and maintain.  E2E tests are great for critical user flows, while unit tests are great for testing small units in the application.
