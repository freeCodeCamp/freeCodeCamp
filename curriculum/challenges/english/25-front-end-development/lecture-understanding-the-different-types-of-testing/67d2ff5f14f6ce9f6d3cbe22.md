What is usability testing and what does the process look like?

Usability testing is when you have real users interacting with the application to discover if there are any design, user experience, or functionality issues in the app. This type of testing is important because this feedback will help ensure that the application meets the needs of the users.

The four common types of usability testing are explorative, comparative, assessment and validation testing.

Let's first start with explorative usability testing. This type of testing involves users interacting with the different features of the application to better understand how they work. The goal here is to identify any potential issues in the application so they can be addressed early on and resolved.

The second type of usability testing is comparative testing. This is where you compare your application's user experience with similar applications in the marketplace. The goal is to see where your application falls short compared to the competition so those areas can be improved on.

The third type of usability testing is assessment testing. This is where you study how intuitive the application is to use and if there are any major blockers for users. This type of testing will result in reduced costs and headaches once the application is live to thousands or even millions of users down the line.

The last type of usability testing is validation testing. This is where you identify any major issues that will prevent the user from using the application effectively. This type of testing usually happens after the initial development stage and just before the final release of the application.

There are many tools out there to assist with usability testing, but here are a few popular ones to be aware of:

- Loop11

- Maze

- Userbrain

- UserTesting and

- UXTweak

It is important to note that functional testing is not the same as usability testing. Functional testing focuses on the functionality of the application while usability testing focuses on the intuitiveness of the application by users.
