What are some common tools developers should know about that are used by designers in the industry?

Design is the foundation of every enterprise-level web application. That's why designers and developers work closely to create user-focused interfaces that are visually appealing and functional.

Because of this, developers should be familiar with common design tools to make the most of what designers offer. Most of these design tools excel in vector-based design and prototyping.

Vector-based design involves creating digital art using mathematical formulas to define lines, shapes, and colors. Prototyping, on the other hand, refers to the process of creating an interactive model of a product or user interface.

Let's talk about some common design tools developers should know about.

Figma is one of the most common and essential design tools that developers should know. This cloud-based tool specializes in User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) design. It enables design and development teams to collaborate from anywhere, offering built-in features such as:

- Vector-based design
- Automatic layout
- Commenting and feedback system
- Version history
- Real-time collaboration
- Design systems, and more.

To get started with Figma, you can use the web-based interface or download the desktop app for your computer. It has a generous free tier, so you can get a lot done without paying for the pro version.

Sketch is another essential design tool that developers should be familiar with. Like Figma, it is vector-based and primarily used for UI/UX design.

Sketch is popular for its intuitive interface and simplicity, making it ideal for developers who want to quickly create prototypes. It's also widely used by designers for tasks like creating UIs, icons, and web layouts.

The main constraints with Sketch are its lack of a cloud-based interface and its availability only on macOS.

Adobe XD is another vector-based design and prototyping tool for UI/UX design, known for its seamless integration with other Adobe apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.

This integration makes workflows such as interactive prototyping and animations more efficient.

Adobe XD is available for both Windows and MacOS and includes a cloud-based interface. For the best experience, however, you should use the app directly.

Another design tool worth mentioning is Canva. You can use Canva to create a wide range of visual content, including posters, cover photos, presentations, short videos, and more. Its user-friendly and simple design makes it ideal for beginners.

Additionally, Canva offers a rich library of templates, images, and design elements that make it easy to create professional-looking designs.

Beyond these features, Canva supports web interface design and allows for collaboration with teammates. The platform is available on the web and as an Android app.

Other popular design tools developers should know are Framer, InVision, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Miro.
