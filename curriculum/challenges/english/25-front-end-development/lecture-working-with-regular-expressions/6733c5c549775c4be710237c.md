The video for this lecture isn't available yet, one will be available soon. Here is a transcript of the lecture for now:

Let's learn how to match or replace all occurrences of a pattern in a string.

You have previously learned about the `replace` and `match` methods, as well as the global `g` modifier. Now you can combine that knowledge to handle all patterns in a string.

Let's recall our original `match` code.

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
const match = "freeCodeCamp".match(regex);
console.log(match);
```

And our resulting `match` object:

But what if we have a string with multiple occurrences of `freecodecamp` to match? Let's take a look at how `match` behaves with that. We'll throw in our old replace example too, just to compare.

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/;
const str = "freecodecamp is the best we love freecodecamp";
const matched = str.match(regex);
const replaced = str.replace(regex, "freeCodeCamp");
console.log(matched);
console.log(replaced);
```

And the result:

Oh no! `Match` only returned the first match, and `replace` only replaced the first match. This is because, by default, `match` and `replace` only operate against the first pattern occurrence.

Thankfully, you can avoid this by using the global modifier on your regular expression. Let's add that to ours:

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/g;
const str = "freecodecamp is the best we love freecodecamp";
const matched = str.match(regex);
const replaced = str.replace(regex, "freeCodeCamp");
console.log(matched);
console.log(replaced);
```

And confirm the result:

That worked! Our `replace` call replaced all of the lowercase `freecodecamp` strings, and our `match` method matched both of them.

What's interesting here is that when you use the global modifier with match, you lose the extra information about capture groups and string indicies that would come in the `match` array.

Thankfully, 2019's ECMAScript update brought us two new methods: `matchAll` and `replaceAll`.

Like their singular counterparts, these methods accept a string or regular expression, and `replaceAll` also accepts a second argument as the string to replace with. But unlike the previous methods, `replaceAll` and `matchAll` will throw an error if you give them a regular expression without the global modifier.

Let's update our code to use these new methods:

```js
const pattern = "freecodecamp";
const str = "freecodecamp is the best we love freecodecamp";
const matched = str.matchAll(pattern);
const replaced = str.replaceAll(pattern, "freeCodeCamp");
console.log(matched);
console.log(replaced);
```

And our result:

Good news! Our `replaceAll` worked exactly as we wanted – it replaced all occurrences of the lowercased `freecodecamp` with the properly camelCased version. But what is that empty object?

Well, `matchAll` returns a special type of object called an Iterator, which the freeCodeCamp console isn't prepared to handle. If we peek in our browser console:

The Iterator has a `next` method, which we can call to get the next value. Let's go ahead and call `matched.next()`, and log the result:

![image](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/lecture-transcripts/how-can-you-match-and-replace-all-occurrences-in-a-string-6.png)

There's our match array! `.next()` gives us an object with two values: done, which is false when there are more elements available in the iterator, and value which is the value we just iterated over.

So, if we call it one more time:

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/g;
const str = "freecodecamp is the best we love freecodecamp";
const matched = str.matchAll(regex);
const replaced = str.replaceAll(regex, "freeCodeCamp");
console.log(matched);
console.log(replaced);
console.log(matched.next());
console.log(matched.next());
```

Wait, why does it say done is still `false`? There should only be two matches in the array, right?

Let's call it a third time and see what we get:

![image](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/lecture-transcripts/how-can-you-match-and-replace-all-occurrences-in-a-string-8.png)

`done` is finally `true`, but why is that value `undefined`? Well, as it turns out, the `matchAll` iterator is lazy. It doesn't find all of your matches at once. It only finds a match when you tell it to by calling `next()`.

As long as it finds a match, it isn't "done". Once it fails to find a match and brings back `undefined`, it is "done". This may seem inconvenient, but it can be quite helpful when your regular expression is computationally expensive.

If your example is less so, like ours, you can skip that feature and extract all of the matches at once by converting it to an array. This is achieved by calling `Array.from()` and passing your iterator as the argument.

Let's update our code to use that – we'll go ahead and clean up our replaceAll calls since we know that works.

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/g;
const str = "freecodecamp is the best we love freecodecamp";
const matched = str.matchAll(regex);
console.log(Array.from(matched))
```

And we finally get our array of matches:

These powerful methods can help you manipulate and extract data from strings without having to sacrifice performance or readability.
