What are some common regular expression modifiers used for searching?

Modifiers, often referred to as "flags", modify the behavior of a regular expression. Let's recall our example from an earlier lecture:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great")); // true
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp")); // false
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP")); // false
console.log(regex.test("free")); // false
console.log(regex.test("code")); // false
console.log(regex.test("camp")); // false
```

If you remember, the all-lowercase and all-uppercase `freeCodeCamp` strings failed to match the pattern. This is because, by default, regular expressions are case-sensitive.

But what if we could tell the regular expression to be case-insensitive? Well, there's a modifier for that. The `i` flag makes a regex ignore case. How can we use it? Flags go after the closing forward slash in a regular expression:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/i;
```

Notice the change to the regular expression on the first line. Now we can check how this changes things:

```js
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great")); // true
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP")); // true
console.log(regex.test("free")); // false
console.log(regex.test("code")); // false
console.log(regex.test("camp")); // false
```

Because our regular expression is now case-insensitive, the all-lowercase and all-uppercase strings have "passed" the test. This can also work for a string with a random mix of uppercase and lowercase letters:

```js
console.log(regex.test("dO yOu LoVe fReEcOdEcAmP?")); // true
```

There are quite a few other flags that you can use. The `g` flag, or global modifier, allows your regular expression to match a pattern more than once. 

Let's see how that affects our code. You'll notice we kept the `i` flag ‚Äì a regular expression can use multiple flags (as many as needed) to achieve your desired behavior:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/gi;
```

Wait a second... what's this? It would seem that the global modifier is making some of our strings that should be passing fail instead:

```js
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great")); // false
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp")); // false
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP")); // true
console.log(regex.test("free")); // false
console.log(regex.test("code")); // false
console.log(regex.test("camp")); // false
```

Why? Well, the global modifier makes your regular expression stateful. This means it keeps track of where it has previously matched a pattern. So when it matches the first `freeCodeCamp` string, it remembers that it found a match starting at index `0`.

We then test it against `freeCodeCamp is great`, but it doesn't start at index `0`. The regular expression "knows" it found a match at index `0` already, so even though this is a different string, it starts from the end index of the match. 

`freeCodeCamp` is `12` characters long, so a match at `0` ends at index `11`. The matching will resume at index `12`. And since `is great` does not match `freeCodeCamp`, it returns `false`.

Then, because it fails to find a match, it "loses" its state and starts the following match back at `0`.

If we switch our logs around so that a string with the match at `0` is followed immediately by a string that has a match later than index `11`:

```js
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("I loooooooove freeCodeCamp")); // true
```

When a regular expression is global, it gets a new property called `lastIndex`. Grabbing our previous code, let's see how this property works:

```js
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 0
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 12
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great")); // false
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 0
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 19
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp")); // false
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 0
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP")); // true
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 12
console.log(regex.test("free")); // false
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 0
console.log(regex.test("code")); // false
console.log(regex.lastIndex); // 0
console.log(regex.test("camp")); // false
```

Looking at this example, you can see how the state of the regular expression changes with each test call using the `lastIndex` to track its previous matches.

The global flag is great when you need to get multiple matches from a single string. But if you're testing multiple strings with the same regular expression it's best to leave the `g` flag off.

Before learning about the next flag, you need to learn about anchors. The carrot (`^`) anchor, at the beginning of the regular expression, says "match the start of the string":

```js
const start = /^freecodecamp/i;
```

The dollar sign (`$`) anchor, at the end of the regular expression, says "match the end of the string":

```js
const end = /freecodecamp$/i;
```

Take a moment to compare the outputs on the right:

```js
const start = /^freecodecamp/i;
const end = /freecodecamp$/i;
console.log(start.test("freecodecamp")); // true
console.log(end.test("freecodecamp")); // true
console.log(start.test("freecodecamp is great")); // true
console.log(end.test("freecodecamp is great")); // false
console.log(start.test("i love freecodecamp")); // false
console.log(end.test("i love freecodecamp")); // true
console.log(start.test("have met freecodecamp's founder")); // false
console.log(end.test("have met freecodecamp's founder")); // false
```

See how the start anchor only matches at the beginning of the string, and the end anchor only matches at the end of the string? But what about matching across multiple lines? Let's take a look at that:

```js
const start = /^freecodecamp/i;
const end = /freecodecamp$/i;
const string = `I really love
freecodecamp
it's my favorite`;
console.log(start.test(string)); // false
console.log(end.test(string)); // false
```

Even though `freecodecamp` is in there on its own line, it fails both tests. This is because, by default, anchors look for the beginning and end of the entire string.

But you can make a regex handle multiple lines with the `m` flag, or the multi-line modifier. Let's add that to our regular expressions to see what we get:

```js
const start = /^freecodecamp/im;
const end = /freecodecamp$/im;
const string = `I really love
freecodecamp
it's my favorite`;
console.log(start.test(string)); // true
console.log(end.test(string)); // true
```

Now they both match! Because the `freecodecamp` is entirely on its own line, the start anchor matches the beginning of that line, and the end anchor matches the end of that line.

Finally, you have the `d` flag, or indices modifier. Remember that the `i` flag is for case-insensitivity, so the indices modifier needed a different flag.

The `d` flag expands the information you get in a match object. Let's add it to our regular expression:

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/di;
const string = "we love freecodecamp isn't freecodecamp great?";
console.log(string.match(regex));
```

And the result is:

```js
// [
//   'freecodecamp',
//   index: 8,
//   input: "we love freecodecamp isn't freecodecamp great?",
//   groups: undefined,
//   indices: [
//     0: [8, 20],
//     groups: undefined
//   ]
// ]
```

Our match object gets a new `indices` property! This property is an array of two numbers, the first being the index in the original string where the match starts, and the second being the index after the match ended. This array also has an extra `groups` property, which is also for named capture groups.

There are a few other flags that you should know are available to you, but are less common in typical code.

The first is the unicode modifier, or `u` flag. This expands the functionality of a regular expression to allow it to match special unicode characters.

You'll learn more about character classes in a later lecture, but the `u` flag gives you access to special classes like `Extended_Pictographic` to match most emoji:

```js
const regex = /üçé/u;

const str = "I have an apple üçé";
console.log(regex.test(str)); // true
```

There is also a `v` flag, which further expands the functionality of the unicode matching.

The second is the sticky modifier, or the `y` flag. The sticky modifier behaves very similarly to the global modifier, but with a few exceptions.

The biggest one is that a global regular expression will start from `lastIndex` and search the entire remainder of the string for another match, but a sticky regular expression will return `null` and reset the `lastIndex` to `0` if there is not immediately a match at the previous `lastIndex`.

And the last is the single-line modifier, or the `s` flag. Remember that the multiline modifier allows start and end anchors to match the start and end of a line, instead of the entire string. 

The single-line modifier allows a wildcard character, represented by a period (`.`) in regex, to match linebreaks ‚Äì effectively treating the string as a single line of text.

There are quite a few of these modifiers, but the `i` and `g` flags are the ones you'll use most frequently, and are the most important to remember.
