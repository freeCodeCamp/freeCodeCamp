What are regular expressions, and what are some common methods?

Regular expressions, or regex, are a feature supported by many different programming languages.

A regular expression is a special syntax to create a "pattern", which you can then use to check against a string, extract text, and more.

Let's take a look at a basic regular expression:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
```

Notice how, in JavaScript, you define a regular expression by creating your pattern between two forward slashes (`/`). Try not to confuse this with a comment, where the text comes after both forward slashes.

This particular regular expression will match the text `freeCodeCamp`, with capital `C`s, anywhere in a string. But how can you actually do that?

That brings us to our first method – the `test()` method. The `test()` method is present on `RegExp` objects, which are objects representing a regular expression (such as the one we just defined).

The `test()` method accepts a string, which is the string to test for matches against the regular expression. For example, let's try testing the string `e`:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
const test = regex.test("e");
console.log(test);
```

You can see we've called the `test()` method on our new regex, and passed the string `e` as the argument. We've also logged the result:

```js
console.log(test); // false
```

The `test()` method returned `false` because the string `e` does not match the pattern `freeCodeCamp`. Even though the pattern `freeCodeCamp` includes the letter `e`, that's the opposite direction of how regular expressions work.

Let's take a look at a few more examples. Take a moment to consider these:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp"));
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great"));
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp"));
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp"));
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP"));
console.log(regex.test("free"));
console.log(regex.test("code"));
console.log(regex.test("camp"));
```

What do you think each line will print? Well, here's the result:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freeCodeCamp is great")); // true
console.log(regex.test("I love freeCodeCamp")); // true
console.log(regex.test("freecodecamp")); // false
console.log(regex.test("FREECODECAMP")); // false
console.log(regex.test("free")); // false
console.log(regex.test("code")); // false
console.log(regex.test("camp")); // false
```

Did that surprise you? Notice how the first three strings returned `true`. These strings all contain the text, `freeCodeCamp`, exactly, somewhere in the string. 

Lines 5 and 6 return `false`. While they contain the text `freecodecamp`, the case does not match. Regular expressions are case-sensitive by default.

Finally, while the last three contain a portion of the pattern, the strings do not contain the entire pattern.

The `test()` method returns a `boolean`, indicating whether the string matches the regular expression at all.

But what if you wanted more information than that? Well, strings have a `match()` method. This method accepts a regular expression, although you can also pass a string which will be constructed into a regular expression.

`match()` returns the match array for the string. What's a match array? Well, let's take a look:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
const match = "freeCodeCamp".match(regex);
console.log(match);
```

If we run this, we get an array back! But it's a strange looking array. It's got some extra properties:

```js
console.log(match);
// [
//   'freeCodeCamp',
//   index: 0,
//   input: 'freeCodeCamp',
//   groups: undefined
// ]
```

The `groups` property would show any captured groups. You will learn what that means in a future lecture.

The `index` property tells you at what character in the string the match was found. In our case, it was found at the beginning of the string.

The `input` property tells you the string the `match()` method was called on.

Let's try a few more again, and see how the result changes:

```js
const regex = /freeCodeCamp/;
console.log("freeCodeCamp".match(regex)); // ['freeCodeCamp', index: 0, input: 'freeCodeCamp', groups: undefined]
console.log("freeCodeCamp is great".match(regex)); // ['freeCodeCamp', index: 0, input: 'freeCodeCamp is great', groups: undefined]
console.log("I love freeCodeCamp".match(regex)); // ['freeCodeCamp', index: 7, input: 'I love freeCodeCamp', groups: undefined]
console.log("freecodecamp".match(regex)); // null
console.log("FREECODECAMP".match(regex)); // null
console.log("free".match(regex)); // null
```

We know already that the first three strings should produce a match, so let's take a look at those:

```js
// ['freeCodeCamp', index: 0, input: 'freeCodeCamp', groups: undefined]
// ['freeCodeCamp', index: 0, input: 'freeCodeCamp is great', groups: undefined]
// ['freeCodeCamp', index: 7, input: 'I love freeCodeCamp', groups: undefined]
```

Is that what you expected? You can see how the `input` and `index` have changed depending on the string provided, and the location of the match in the string. 

The other three lines, which do not match, return `null` instead of an array.

Now that we can test and match strings with our regular expression, what if we want to replace the content of a string? Maybe someone has written `freecodecamp` in all lowercase, and we want to automatically fix the casing for them.

First, we need to update our regular expression to match the lowercase form of `freecodecamp`, and create our test string:

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/;
const str = "freecodecamp is rly kewl";
```

Now, strings have a `replace()` method which accepts two arguments: the regular expression to match (or a string, if you don't need all of the features of regex), and the string to replace the match with (or a function to run against each match). 

So if we wanted to replace our `freecodecamp` with the proper casing:

```js
const regex = /freecodecamp/;
const str = "freecodecamp is rly kewl";
const replaced = str.replace(regex, "freeCodeCamp");
console.log(replaced);
```

And we'll peek at the result:

```js
console.log(replaced); // freeCodeCamp is rly kewl
```

You can see that `replace()` returns the updated string with the matching pattern `replaced`.

Regular expressions, and all of the methods associated with them, can seem complex and overwhelming. But you'll get the chance to explore them further in this next set of lectures.
