# --description--

In this workshop, you are going to build a *Caesar cipher*. This is one of the simplest techniques to encrypt text, which consists of substituting each letter of the plain text with the letter found at a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 5, `a` would be replaced by `f`, `b` by `g` and so on.

To implement this cipher, you'll need to create a new version of your alphabet that starts at the position indicated by the shift. As you learned in a previous lecture, you can extract part of a string using string slicing:

```py
fcc = 'freeCodeCamp'
print(fcc[8:]) # Camp
```

Create a variable named `shifted_alphabet` and use the slicing syntax to assign it the portion of `alphabet` that starts at the index of `shift`. Then, call the built-in `print()` function to print `shifted_alphabet` on the terminal and look at the result.

# --hints--

You should declare a new variable named `shifted_alphabet`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`_Node(_code).has_variable("shifted_alphabet")`)) })

```

You should assign `alphabet[shift:]` to `shifted_alphabet`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`_Node(_code).find_variable("shifted_alphabet").is_equivalent("shifted_alphabet = alphabet[shift:]")`)) })
```

You should call the `print()` function passing in `shifted_alphabet` as an argument.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`_Node(_code).has_call("print(shifted_alphabet)")`)) })
```

alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
shift = 5
