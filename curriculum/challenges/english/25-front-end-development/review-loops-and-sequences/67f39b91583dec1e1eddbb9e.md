# --description--

## Python Lists

- In Python, the list data type is an ordered sequence of elements that can be comprised of strings, numbers or even other lists.
- Lists are mutable and zero based indexed.

Here is the basic syntax for a list:

```python
cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']
```

## Accessing elements in a list

- To access an element from the `cities` list, you can reference its index number in the sequence:

```python
cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']
cities[0] # 'Los Angeles'
```

- To access the last element of any list, you can use `-1` as the index number:

```python
cities = ['Los Angeles', 'London', 'Tokyo']
cities[-1] # 'Tokyo'
```

- Negative indexing is used to access elements starting from the end of the list instead of the beginning at index `0`.

## Creating Lists Using the `list()` constructor

- Lists can also be created using the `list()` constructor. The `list()` constructor is used to convert an iterable into a list:

```python
developer = 'Jessica'

print(list(developer)) 
# Result: ['J', 'e', 's', 's', 'i', 'c', 'a']
```

## Finding the Length of a List

- You can use the `len()` function to get the length of a list:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
len(numbers) # 5
```

## Mutability of Lists

- Lists are mutable, meaning you can update any element in the list as long as you pass in a valid index number. To update lists at a particular index, you can assign a new value to that index:

```python
programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']
programming_languages[0] = 'JavaScript'
print(programming_languages) # ['JavaScript', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']
```

- If you pass in an index (either positive or negative) that is out of bounds for the list, then you will receive an `IndexError`:

```python
programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']
programming_languages[10] = 'JavaScript'

"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list assignment index out of range
"""
```

## Removing Elements from a List

- Elements can be removed from a list using the `del` keyword:

```python
developer = ['Jane Doe', 23, 'Python Developer']
del developer[1]
print(developer) # ['Jane Doe', 'Python Developer']
```

## Checking if an Element Exists in a List

- The `in` keyword can be used to check if an element exists in a list:

```py
programming_languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust']

'Rust' in programming_languages # True
'JavaScript' in programming_languages # False
```

## Nesting Lists

- Lists can be nested inside other lists:

```python
developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]
```

- To access the nested list, you will need to access it using index `2` since lists are zero based indexed.

```python
developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]
developer[2] # ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']
```

- To further access the second language from that nested list, you will need to access it using index `1`:

```python
developer = ['Alice', 25, ['Python', 'Rust', 'C++']]
developer[2][1] # 'Rust'
```

## Unpacking Values from a List

- Unpacking values from a list is a technique used to assign values from a list to new variables.
- For example, you can unpack the `developer` list into new variables called `name`, `age` and `job` like this:

```py
developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']
name, age, job = developer
```

- In the above example, `name` will hold the value of `'Alice'`, `age` holds the value of `34` and `job` holds the value of `'Rust Developer'`.
- To collect any remaining elements from a list, you can use the asterisk (`*`) operator like this:

```py
developer = ['Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer']
name, *rest = developer
```

- In the above example, `name` will still hold the value of `'Alice'` and `rest` will be a list of two items: `[34, 'Rust Developer']`.

- If the numbers of variables on the left side of the assignment operator doesnâ€™t match the total numbers of items in the list, then you will receive a `ValueError`.

## Slicing Lists

- Slicing is the concept of accessing a portion of a list by using the slice operator `:`. 
- To slice a list that starts at index `1` and ends at index `3`, you can use the following syntax:

```python
desserts = ['Cake', 'Cookies', 'Ice Cream', 'Pie']
desserts[1:3] # ['Cookies', 'Ice Cream']
```

- It is also possible to specify a step interval which determines how much to increment between the indices.
- For example, if you wanted to extract a list of just even numbers, you can use the slicing operator like this:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
numbers[1::2] # [2, 4, 6]
```

## List Methods

- The `append()` method is used to add an item to the end of the list.
- Here is an example of using the `append()` method to add the number `6` to this `numbers` list:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- The `append()` method can also be used to add one list at the end of another:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = [6, 8, 10]

numbers.append(even_numbers)
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [6, 8, 10]]
```

- The `extend()` method is used to add multiple items to the end of a list.
- Here is an example of adding the numbers `6`, `8`, and `10` to the end of the `numbers` list:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = [6, 8, 10]

numbers.extend(even_numbers)
print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10]
```

- The `insert()` method is used to insert an item at a specific index in the list.
- Here is an example of using the `insert()` method:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.insert(2, 2.5)

print(numbers) # [1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5]
```

- The `remove()` method is used to remove an item from the list.
- The `remove()` method will only remove the first occurrence of an item in the list.
- For example, you can remove the number `5` from the `numbers` list like this:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5]
numbers.remove(5)

print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5, 5]
```

- The `pop()` method is used to remove a specific item from the list and return it:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.pop(1) # The number 2 is returned
```

- If you don't specify an element for the `pop` method, then the last element is removed.

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.pop() # The number 5 is returned
```

- The `clear()` method is used to remove all items from the list:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.clear()

print(numbers) # []
```

- The `sort()` method is used to sort the elements in place. Here is an example of sorting a random list of `numbers` in place:

```py
numbers = [19, 2, 35, 1, 67, 41]
numbers.sort()

print(numbers) # [1, 2, 19, 35, 41, 67]
```

- The `sorted()` method is used to sort the elements in a list and return a new sorted list instead of modifying the original list.

- The `reverse` method is used to reverse the order of the elements in a list:

```py
numbers = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
numbers.reverse()

print(numbers) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

- The `index()` method is used to find the first index where an element can be found in a list:

```python
programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']
programming_languages.index('Java') # 1
```

- If the element cannot be found using the `index()` method, then the result will be a `ValueError`.

## Tuples in Python

- A tuple is a Python data type used to create an ordered sequence of values. Tuples can contain a mixed set of data types:

```py
developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')
```

- Tuples are immutable meaning the elements in the tuple cannot be changed once created. If you try to update one of the items in the tuple, you will get a `TypeError`:

```py
programming_languages = ('Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust')
programming_languages[0] = 'JavaScript'

"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: "tuple" object does not support item assignment
"""
```

- To access an element from a tuple, use bracket notation and the index number:

```py
developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')
developer[1] # 34
```

- Negative indexing can be used to access elements starting from the end of the tuple.
- Here is an example of using a negative index to access the second to last element in a tuple:

```py
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers[-2] # 4
```

- If you try to pass in an index number that exceeds or equals the length of the tuple, then you will receive an `IndexError`:

```py
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers[7]

"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: list index out of range
"""
```

- A tuple can also be created using the `tuple()` constructor. Within the constructor, you can pass in different iterables like strings, lists and even other tuples.

```python
developer = 'Jessica'

print(tuple(developer)) 
# Result: ('J', 'e', 's', 's', 'i', 'c', 'a')
```

- To check if an item is in a tuple, you can use the `in` keyword like this:

```py
programming_languages = ('Python', 'Java', 'C++', 'Rust')

'Rust' in programming_languages # True
'JavaScript' in programming_languages # False
```

- Items can be unpacked from a tuple.
- For example, you can unpack the `developer` tuple into new variables called `name`, `age` and `job` like this:

```py
developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')
name, age, job = developer
```

- If you need to collect any remaining elements from a tuple, you can use the asterisk (`*`) operator like this:

```py
developer = ('Alice', 34, 'Rust Developer')
name, *rest = developer
```

- Slicing can be used to extract a portion of a tuple.
- For example, the items `'pie'` and `'cookies'` can be sliced into a separate tuple:

```py
desserts = ('cake', 'pie', 'cookies', 'ice cream')
desserts[1:3] # ('pie', 'cookies')
```

- Removing an item from a tuple will raise a `TypeError` as tuples are immutable:

```py
developer = ('Jane Doe', 23, 'Python Developer')
del developer[1]

"""
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: "tuple" object doesn't support item deletion
"""
```

- **When to use a tuple vs a list?**: If you need a dynamic collection of elements where you can add, remove and update elements, then you should use a list. 
- If you know that you are working with a fixed and immutable collection of data, then you should use a tuple.

## Common Tuple Methods

- The `count()` function is used to determine how many times an item appears in a tuple.
- For example, you can check how many times the language `'Rust'` appears in the tuple:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')
programming_languages.count('Rust') # 2
```

- If the specified item in the `count()` function is not present at all in the tuple, then the return value will be 0:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')
programming_languages.count('JavaScript') # 0
```

- If no arguments are passed into the `count()` function, then Python will return a `TypeError`.

- The `index()` method is used to find the index where a particular item is present in the tuple. 
- Here is an example of using the `index()` method to find the index for the language `'Java'`:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust')
programming_languages.index('Java') # 1
```

- If the specified item cannot be found, then Python will return a `ValueError`.

- You can pass an optional start index to the `index()` method to specify where to start searching for the item in the tuple:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')
programming_languages.index('Python', 3) # 5
```

- You can also pass in an optional end index to the `index()` method to specify where to stop searching for the item in the tuple:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python', 'JavaScript', 'Python')
programming_languages.index('Python', 2, 5) # 2
```

- The `sorted` function is used to sort the elements in any iterable and return a new sorted list.
- Here is an example of creating a new list of numbers using the `sorted()` function:

```py
numbers = (13, 2, 78, 3, 45, 67, 18, 7)
sorted(numbers) # [2, 3, 7, 13, 18, 45, 67, 78]
```

- You can customize the sorting behavior for an iterable using the optional `reverse` and `key` arguments. 
- Here is an example of using the `key` argument to sort items in a tuple by length:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')
sorted(programming_languages, key=len)

# Result
# ['C++', 'Rust', 'Java', 'Rust', 'Python', 'Python']
```

- You can create a new list of values in reverse order, using the `reverse` argument like this:

```py
programming_languages = ('Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++', 'Rust', 'Python')

print(sorted(programming_languages, reverse=True))

# Result
# ['Rust', 'Rust', 'Python', 'Python', 'Java', 'C++']
```

## Loops in Python

- Loops are used to repeat a block of code for a set number of times.

- The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple or string) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence.
- Here is an example of using a `for` loop to iterate through a list and print each language to the console:

```py
programming_languages = ['Rust', 'Java', 'Python', 'C++']

for language in programming_languages:
    print(language)

"""
Result 

'Rust'
'Java'
'Python'
'C++'
"""'''
```

- Here is an example of using a `for` loop to loop through the string `'code'` and print out each character:

```py
for char in 'code':
    print(char)

"""
Result 

'c'
'o'
'd'
'e'
"""
```

- `for` loops can be nested. 
- Here is an example of using a nested `for` loop:

```py
categories = ['Fruit', 'Vegetable']
foods = ['Apple', 'Carrot', 'Banana']

for category in categories:
    for food in foods:
        print(category, food)

"""
Result

Fruit Apple
Fruit Carrot
Fruit Banana
Vegetable Apple
Vegetable Carrot
Vegetable Banana
"""

```

- The `while` loop is another loop type that repeats a block of code until the condition is `False`. 

Here is an example of using a `while` loop for a guessing game:

```py
secret_number = 3
guess = 0

while guess != secret_number:
    guess = int(input('Guess the number (1-5): '))
    if guess != secret_number:
        print('Wrong! Try again.')

print('You got it!')

"""
Result

Guess the number (1-5): 2
Wrong! Try again.
Guess the number (1-5): 1
Wrong! Try again.
Guess the number (1-5): 3
You got it!
"""

```

- Python supports `break` and `continue` statements in loops to modify the execution of a loop.

- The `break` statement is used to exit the loop immediately when a certain condition is met.

Here is an example of using the `break` statement for a list of `developer_names`:

```py
developer_names = ['Jess', 'Naomi', 'Tom']

for developer in developer_names:
    if developer == 'Naomi':
        break
    print(developer)
```

- The `continue` statement is used to skip that current iteration and move onto the next iteration of the loop. 

Here is an example to use the `continue` statement instead of a `break` statement:

```py
developer_names = ['Jess', 'Naomi', 'Tom']

for developer in developer_names:
    if developer == 'Naomi':
        continue
    print(developer)
```

- Both `for` and `while` loops can be combined with an `else` clause, which is executed only when the loop was not terminated by a `break`:

```python
words = ['sky', 'apple', 'rhythm', 'fly', 'orange']

for word in words:
    for letter in word:
        if letter.lower() in 'aeiou':
            print(f"'{word}' contains the vowel '{letter}'")
            break
    else:
        print(f"'{word}' has no vowels")
```
