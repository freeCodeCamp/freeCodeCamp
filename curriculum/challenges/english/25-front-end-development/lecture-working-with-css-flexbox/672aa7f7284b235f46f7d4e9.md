What is CSS flexbox, and when should you use it?

CSS flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to arrange elements in rows and columns within a container. You can also control their order and orientation. Web developers use it to create responsive websites and web applications that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations. We refer to flexbox as a one-dimensional layout model because it focuses on arranging elements along a single axis at a time. The axis can be either horizontal or vertical. 

There are two key concepts that you should know about before you start working with flexbox: flex container and flex item.

A flex container is an HTML element with a flex layout. You can arrange and align elements in various ways within a flex container. To make an HTML element a flex container, you need to add `display: flex` to its CSS styles.

Flex items are the direct children of a flex container. These elements can be arranged and aligned within a flex container based on its properties. They can also shrink or expand to fit the available space.

This is an example with a `main` container and three child `div` elements:

```html
<main>
  <div id="first-div"></div>
  <div id="second-div"></div>
  <div id="third-div"></div>
</main>
```

If you set only the `width`, `height`, and `background-color` of these `div` elements in the CSS stylesheet, every child element will be placed on its own row because the container is not flex by default. That is:

```css
div {
  width: 80px;
  height: 50px;
}

#first-div {
  background-color: #4d70b2;
}

#second-div {
  background-color: #5c4db2;
}

#third-div {
  background-color: #4da3b2;
}
```

But if you add `display: flex` to the `main` container, the `div` elements will be rearranged to fit on the same row and they will shrink if necessary:

```css
main {
  display: flex;
}
```

By default, a flex container will be a block-level element, so the container itself will be on its own row relative to other elements and containers.

Now that you know more about flex containers and flex items, you should also know about flex properties. These properties determine how flex items will be arranged, resized, and distributed within the flex container. Some of the most commonly used ones are `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap`.

Great. Now letâ€™s talk a little bit about the flex model. This model defines how flex items are arranged within a flex container. Every flex container has two axes:

- The main axis.
- The cross axis.

The orientation of these axes determines how different properties will affect the layout and distribution of the flex items. By default, the main axis of a flex container is horizontal and the cross axis is vertical. Flex items are arranged in the direction of the main axis. The cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.

The `flex-direction` property sets the direction of the main axis. The default value of `flex-direction` is `row`, which places all the flex items on the same row, in the direction of your browser's default language (left to right or right to left):

```css
flex-direction: row; /* Default */
```

To reverse the items in the row, you can use `flex-direction: row-reverse`:

```css
flex-direction: row-reverse; 
```

This will reverse the order of the flex items. If you want to align the flex items vertically instead, you just need to set `flex-direction` to `column` in the flex container. This will change the direction of the main axis:

```css
flex-direction: column;
```

Now the `div` elements will be aligned vertically because the main axis will be vertical and the cross axis will be horizontal. You can also reverse the order of the flex items vertically with `flex-direction: column-reverse`:

```css
flex-direction: column-reverse;
```

CSS flexbox is a powerful layout model that provides a flexible and efficient way to arrange elements within a container. By understanding the key concepts of flex containers, flex items, and the various flex properties, you can create dynamic and responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
