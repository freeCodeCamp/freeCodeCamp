What are some common flex properties, and how do they work?

Flex properties are properties that you can apply to flex containers to determine the distribution of child elements. We'll cover some of the most commonly used ones: `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.

Let's start with `flex-wrap`. This property determines how flex items are wrapped within a flex container to fit the available space. `flex-wrap` can take three possible values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`. `nowrap` is the default valueâ€”flex items won't be wrapped onto a new line, even if their width exceeds the container's width.

In the code below, we have three `div` elements. Let's focus on the `width`. The `main` container with the `red` `border` has a `width` of `200px`, while its three child `div` elements combined have a `width` of `240px` (`80px` each):

```css
main {
  width: 200px;
  display: flex;
  border: 2px solid red;
}

div {
  width: 80px;
  height: 50px;
}

#first-div {
  background-color: #4d70b2;
}

#second-div {
  background-color: #5c4db2;
}

#third-div {
  background-color: #4da3b2;
}
```

The width of the `div` elements exceeds the width of their container, but by default they will be shrunk to fit the available space. If you do want to wrap them when they exceed the width of their container, you can set `flex-wrap: wrap` on the flex container:

```css
flex-wrap: wrap;
```

The `div` elements will be rearranged in rows when they exceed the width of their container. You can wrap flex items in reverse order with `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`. The `flex-flow` property is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`. In this example, we set `flex-direction` to `column` and `flex-wrap` to `wrap-reverse`:

```css
flex-flow: column wrap-reverse;
```

Great. Now let's talk about `justify-content`. `justify-content` aligns the child elements along the main axis of the flex container. If you assign the value `flex-start` to `justify-content`, the flex items will be aligned to the start of the main axis. This could be horizontal or vertical:

```css
justify-content: flex-start;
```

With `justify-content: flex-end`, flex items are aligned to the end of the main axis, horizontally or vertically. To center the flex items along the main axis, you can use `justify-content: center`. To distribute the elements evenly along the main axis, you can use `justify-content: space-between`. This will add some space between the flex items if needed.

`justify-content: space-around` distributes flex items evenly within the main axis, adding a space before the first item and after the last item. This additional space is half of the space between each pair of adjacent items. If there's only one item to distribute, it will be centered.


And last but not least, we have `justify-content: space-evenly`, which distributes the items evenly along the main axis. The space between the items and the space before and after the first and last elements, are exactly the same:

```css
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

Great. Now you know how to distribute flex items along the main axis. But you may also want to distribute them along the cross axis. Remember that the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. You can do this with the `align-items` property. To center the items along the cross axis, you just need to add `align-items: center` to the flex container: 

```css
align-items: center;
```

In this example, the flex items are centered along the cross axis, which is vertical by default. If the cross axis is horizontal, they will be centered horizontally instead. In contrast, `align-items: flex-start` aligns the items to the start of the cross axis:

```css
align-items: flex-start;
```

The opposite is `align-items: flex-end`. This will align flex items to the end of the cross axis, vertically or horizontally. To stretch the flex items along the cross axis, you can use `align-items: stretch`. This also works with elements that are automatically sized, such as those without set `width` or `height`, or with only a minimum `width` or `height`. The flex items will stretch to fill the container in the direction of the cross axis.

And finally, you can use the `align-self` property to assign a different alignment on the cross axis to an individual flex item. For example, you can stretch it with `align-self: stretch`. You can center it with `align-self: center`. You can align it to the start of the cross axis with `align-self: flex-start`. Or you can align it to the end of the cross axis with `align-self: flex-end`.

There are other flex properties and values that you can choose from to create the responsive layout that you envision, but these are the most commonly-used ones. With these CSS flex properties and your new knowledge of the CSS flex model, you can start creating responsive layouts to create a smooth and inclusive user experience across devices.
