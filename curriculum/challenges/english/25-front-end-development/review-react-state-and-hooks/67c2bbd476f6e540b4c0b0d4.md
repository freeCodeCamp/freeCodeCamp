## Working with Events in React

- **Synthetic Event System**: This is React's way of handling events. It serves as a wrapper around the native events like the `click`, `keydown`, and `submit` events. Event handlers in React use the camel casing naming convention. (Ex. `onClick`, `onSubmit`, etc)

Here is an example of using the `onClick` attribute for a `button` element in React:

```js
function handleClick() {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
}

<button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
```

In React, event handler functions usually start with the prefix handle to indicate they are responsible for handling events, like `handleClick` or `handleSubmit`.

When a user action triggers an event, React passes a Synthetic Event object to your handler. This object behaves much like the native event object in vanilla JavaScript, providing properties like `type`, `target`, and `currentTarget`.

To prevent default behaviors like browser refresh during an `onSubmit` event, for example, you can call the `preventDefault()` method:

```js
function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Form submitted!");
}

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
  <input type="text" />
  <button>Submit</button>
</form>;
```

You can also wrap a handler function in an arrow function like this:

```js
function handleDelete(id) {
  console.log("Deleting item:", id);
}

<button onClick={() => handleDelete(1)}>Delete Item</button>;
```

## Working with State and the `useState` Hook

- **Definition for state**: In React, state is a object that contains data for a component. When the state updates the component will re-render. React treats state as immutable, meaning you should not modify it directly.  
- **`useState()` Hook**: The `useState` hook is a function that lets you declare state variables in functional components.Â  Here is an basic syntax:

```js
const [stateVariable, setStateFunction] = useState(initialValue);
```

In the state variable you have the following:

- `stateVariable` holds the current state value
- `setStateFunction` (the setter function) updates the state variable
- `initialValue` sets the initial state

Here is a complete example for a `Counter` component:

```js
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{count}</h2>

      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

## Rendering and React Components 

- **Definition**: In React, rendering is the process by which components appear in the user interface (UI), usually the browser. The rendering process consists of three stages: trigger, render, and commit. The trigger stage occurs when React detects that something has changed and the user interface (UI) might need to be updated. This change is often due to an update in state or props. Once the trigger happens, React enters the render stage. Here, React re-evaluates your components and figures out what to display. To do this, React uses a lightweight copy of the "real" DOM called the virtual DOM. With the virtual DOM, React can quickly check what needs to change in the component. The commit stage is where React takes the prepared changes from the virtual DOM and applies them to the real DOM. In other words, this is the stage where you see the final result on the screen.
