What are some of the common web browsers available today, and how do you install one? 

Web browsers are applications you use to visit pages on the internet. If you are going through the freeCodeCamp curriculum, there is a very good chance you are using a web browser right now!

As of 2024, the most popular browsers are Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Google Chrome, and Safari. There are quite a few other options, and market shares are always changing, but these four are the most common at this time.

Your operating system most likely comes with a browser installed by default. For Windows, you'd have Microsoft Edge. For Mac, you'd have Safari. For Linux, you'll probably have Firefox.

But what if you want to use a different browser?

The good news is you already have a default browser. So you can navigate to the web page for the browser you want, and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

When choosing a browser, consider factors like speed, security features, and compatibility with websites you frequently visit.

Some browsers offer unique features. For example, Opera has a built-in VPN, while Brave focuses on privacy and ad-blocking.

Installation is usually straightforward. After downloading the installer, simply run it and follow the on-screen instructions.

Most browsers will offer to import your bookmarks and settings from your current default browser, making the transition easier.

Alternatively, you can install a browser through your operating system's package manager, such as `brew install --cask google-chrome` on macOS with Homebrew, or `yay -S brave-bin` on Arch Linux.

The package manager and package names available to you will vary depending on your operating system.

Remember, you're not limited to just one browser. Many people use different browsers for different purposes â€“ perhaps one for work and another for personal browsing.

Feel free to experiment with different browsers to find what works best for you.
