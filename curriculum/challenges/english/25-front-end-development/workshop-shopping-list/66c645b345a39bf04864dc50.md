# --description--

To see the updated shopping list, you will need to log the current shopping list and a short message to the console.

Since this message will be used repeatedly throughout the workshop, it is best to create a reusable function.

Create a function called `getShoppingListMsg` that returns the string `"Current Shopping List: "` followed by the `shoppingList` array. 

You can use template literals or string concatenation with the `+` operator to combine the string and the `shoppingList` array.

# --hints--

You should have a function called `getShoppingListMsg` in your code.

```js
assert.isFunction(getShoppingListMsg);
```

Your `getShoppingListMsg` function should return a string.

```js
assert.isString(getShoppingListMsg(shoppingList));
```

Your `getShoppingListMsg` function should return the message of `"Current Shopping List: "` followed by the `shoppingList` array. Double check spacing and spelling errors.

```js
assert.strictEqual(getShoppingListMsg(["Apples"]), "Current Shopping List: Apples");
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
console.log("Grocery shopping list");

const shoppingList = [];

console.log("It will be nice to have some fruit to eat.");

shoppingList.push("Apples");
