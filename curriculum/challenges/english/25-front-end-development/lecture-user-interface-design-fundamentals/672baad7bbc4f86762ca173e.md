What are best practices for working with images in your designs?

Adding images to your websites is a great way to engage your users and increase the visual appeal of your site. But there are a few things to consider when working with images in your designs.

The first thing to consider is creating responsive images. Responsive images are images that scale to fit the size of the screen they are being viewed on. This is important because it ensures that your images look good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Another thing to consider is the resolution for images. Higher quality images with better resolution have more pixels per inch. Pixels are small squares that make up an image.

Pixels per inch, or PPI, is the number of pixels in one inch of an image. The higher the PPI, the better the image quality.

You want to make sure that your images are high quality and look good on all devices. This means that you should use high resolution images that are optimized for the web.

Another thing to consider is the size of your images and how they fit within the spaces in the layout. You want to make sure that your images are the right size and are not too large or too small.

Using large images that are meant to fit in smaller spaces in the design can slow down your website and make it harder for users to load your site. You want to make sure that your images are the right size and are optimized for the web.

When it comes to image placement, you want to think about balance, hierarchy, and alignment to help ensure your images are optimized for the web.

Balance is the distribution of visual weight in a design. You want to make sure there is a good balance between text and images on the site so it creates a harmonious design.

Hierarchy is the order in which elements are viewed on a page. You want to make sure that images that align with important content are placed higher than images that are less important.

Alignment is the placement of elements in relation to each other. You want to make sure that your images are aligned with the text and other elements on your site so that it creates a cohesive design.

The last thing to consider is accessibility for images. You want to make sure that your images are accessible to all users, including those with visual impairments. This means that you should use alt text for your images so that screen readers can read the text to users who are visually impaired.
