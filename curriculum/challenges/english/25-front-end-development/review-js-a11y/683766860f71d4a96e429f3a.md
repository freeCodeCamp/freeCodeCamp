## Best Practices for Building an Accessible Tablist

A tablist requires proper ARIA roles and attributes to be accessible, and JavaScript to be fully functional. The key components include a container with `role="tablist"`, clickable tabs with `role="tab"`, content panels with `role="tabpanel"`, and JavaScript to manage state and visibility.

### HTML Structure and ARIA Attributes

The following HTML demonstrates how to create an accessible tablist:

```html
<div role="tablist" aria-labelledby="fruits-tabs-title">
  <h2 id="fruits-tabs-title">Fruits</h2>

  <button 
    role="tab"
    aria-controls="panel-apple"
    aria-selected="true"
    id="tab-apple"
  >
    Apple
  </button>

  <button 
    role="tab"
    aria-controls="panel-banana"
    aria-selected="false"
    id="tab-banana"
  >
    Banana
  </button>

  <button 
    role="tab"
    aria-controls="panel-cherry"
    aria-selected="false"
    id="tab-cherry"
  >
    Cherry
  </button>
</div>

<div 
  id="panel-apple"
  role="tabpanel"
  aria-labelledby="tab-apple"
>
  Apples are sweet, crisp fruits that come in many varieties and colors.
</div>

<div 
  id="panel-banana"
  role="tabpanel"
  aria-labelledby="tab-banana"
  hidden
>
  Bananas are soft, creamy fruits known for their potassium content.
</div>

<div 
  id="panel-cherry"
  role="tabpanel"
  aria-labelledby="tab-cherry"
  hidden
>
  Cherries are small, round fruits that are both tart and sweet.
</div>
```

- **`role="tablist"`**: Defines an element as a container for a group of related tabs, helping screen reader users better understand and navigate the interface.
- **`role="tab"`**: Marks each button as a tab that can be selected to show related content.
- **`role="tabpanel"`**: Identifies content areas that are controlled by tabs.
- **`aria-controls` attribute**: Connects each tab to its corresponding panel using the panel's `id`.
- **`aria-selected` attribute**: Indicates which tab is currently active (`true`) or inactive (`false`).
- **`aria-labelledby` attribute**: Creates a relationship between an element and the text that names it. For tab panels, this means pointing to the tab that reveals the panel.
- **`hidden` attribute**: Hides inactive panels from both visual and assistive technology users.

### JavaScript Functionality

The following code demonstrates how to manage the state of the tabs and panels, ensuring that only one tab is selected at a time and the corresponding panel is displayed:

```js
tabs.forEach(tab => {
  tab.addEventListener("click", () => {
    tabs.forEach(t => t.setAttribute("aria-selected", "false"));
    panels.forEach(p => p.hidden = true);
    
    tab.setAttribute("aria-selected", "true");
    const associatedPanel = tab.getAttribute("aria-controls");
    const panel = document.getElementById(associatedPanel);
    panel.hidden = false;
  });
});
```

When a tab is clicked:

- First mark all tabs as unselected and hides all panels. 
- Then, mark the clicked tab as selected by setting its `aria-selected` attribute to `true`. 
- Next, find the panel associated with the clicked tab using the tab's `aria-controls` attribute, and makes that panel visible by removing its `hidden` property.

## Working with Live Regions and Dynamic Content

- **`aria-live` attribute**: Makes part of a webpage a live region, meaning any updates inside that area will be announced by a screen reader so users don't miss important changes.
- **`polite` value**: Most live regions use this value. This value means that the update is not urgent, so the screen reader can wait until it finishes any current announcement or the user completes their current action before announcing the update.

Here is an example of a live region that is dynamically updated by JavaScript:

```html
<div aria-live="polite" id="status"></div>
```

```js
const statusEl = document.getElementById("status");
statusEl.textContent = "Your file has been successfully uploaded.";
```

- **`contenteditable` attribute**: Turns the element into a live editor, allowing users to update its content as if it were a text field. When there is no visible label or heading for a contenteditable region, add an accessible name using the `aria-label` attribute to help screen reader users understand the purpose of the editable area.

```html
<div contenteditable="true" aria-label="Note editor">
  Editable content goes here
</div>
```

## `focus` and `blur` Events

- **`blur` event**: Fires when an element loses focus.

```js
element.addEventListener("blur", () => {
  // Handle when user leaves the element
});
```

- **`focus` event**: Fires when an element receives focus.

```js
element.addEventListener("focus", () => {
  // Handle when user enters the element
});
```
