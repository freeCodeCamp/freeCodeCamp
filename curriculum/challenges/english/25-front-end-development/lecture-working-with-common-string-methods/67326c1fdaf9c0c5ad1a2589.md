How can you change the casing for a string?

When working with strings in JavaScript, there are many situations where you might need to adjust the case of the text, such as transforming all letters to uppercase for a heading or converting text to lowercase for uniformity.

Luckily, JavaScript makes this easy with two built-in methods: `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`.

The `toUpperCase()` method converts all the characters to uppercase letters and returns a new string with all uppercase characters. This is useful when you want to emphasize text or create consistency in the format of strings.

Let's see an example:

```js
let greeting = "Hello, World!";
let uppercaseGreeting = greeting.toUpperCase();
console.log(uppercaseGreeting);  // Output: "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

In this code, the `toUpperCase()` method transforms the entire string into uppercase letters.

The original string remains unchanged because `toUpperCase()` returns a new string, rather than modifying the original one.

On the flip side, the `toLowerCase()` method converts all characters in a string to lowercase. This is helpful when you need to standardize input, such as when comparing user-provided text or making case-insensitive checks.

Let's look at an example:

```js
let shout = "I AM LEARNING JAVASCRIPT!";
let lowercaseShout = shout.toLowerCase();
console.log(lowercaseShout);  // Output: "i am learning javascript!"
```

The `toLowerCase()` method converts all characters to lowercase, making the string less aggressive, while leaving the original string unchanged.

In summary, the `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` methods in JavaScript are powerful tools for transforming strings into all uppercase or lowercase letters.

These methods are particularly useful for standardizing text input, making case-insensitive comparisons, and ensuring design consistency.

With these simple yet effective methods, you can handle text manipulation in a more controlled and predictable way.
