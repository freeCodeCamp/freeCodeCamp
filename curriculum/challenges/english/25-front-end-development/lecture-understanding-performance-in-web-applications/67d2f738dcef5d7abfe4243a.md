How do you improve time to usable?

Improving the "time to usable", or in other words the interval from when a user requests a page to when they can meaningfully interact with it, is crucial for enhancing user experience.

Let's explore effective strategies to achieve a faster "time to usable”.

Begin by focusing on the content that users see first. This means loading essential elements immediately and deferring non-critical components.

For example, you could try to implement lazy loading.

We have already covered lazy loading - but here is an example of lazy load images as a refresher. All you need to do is add the loading="lazy" attribute to image tags.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Description">
```

This defers the loading of images until they are needed, typically when they enter the user's viewport. By loading images and videos only when they enter the viewport, we are conserving bandwidth as well as causing the speed up of initial rendering.

Normally, a webpage loads all images at once, even those not visible on the screen. With lazy loading, images below the fold, or in other words off-screen, they are only loaded when the user scrolls down to them.

And here is an example of lazy load Iframes. You can apply the same attribute that you did before, but this time to iframes, and the same concept will apply.

```html
<iframe src="video.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
```

You can also use the defer attribute to delay non-critical JavaScript until after the initial page load. Here is an example of us doing just that.

```html
<script src="non-critical.js" defer></script>
```

You could also consider minimizing render-blocking resources.

Render-blocking resources delay the page from becoming interactive.

To avoid this, you could try loading CSS asynchronously. For non-critical CSS, use the media attribute to load stylesheets conditionally. Here is an example of us doing just that.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" media="print">
```

By specifying media value as print, the print.css will only be loaded when the page is printed.

```html
<!-- This stylesheet is only loaded on screens wider than 800px -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="desktop.css" media="(min-width: 800px)">
```

In this next example, by passing min-width: 800px as the value to the media attribute, we are saying we only want desktop.css to load for screens wider than 800px.

This saves bandwidth by skipping unnecessary styles.

Conclusion

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly reduce the 'time to usable' for your website, ensuring users can interact with your content promptly.
