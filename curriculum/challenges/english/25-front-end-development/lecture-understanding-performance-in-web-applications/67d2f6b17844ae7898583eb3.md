What is INP?

Have you ever clicked on a webpage and felt like nothing happened? This delay impacts user experience and is measured by a metric called Interaction to Next Paint, or INP.

INP assesses a page's overall responsiveness by measuring the time from when a user interacts — like a click or key press — to the next time the browser updates the display. A lower INP indicates a more responsive page.

But why is INP important? A high INP can make users feel that a page is unresponsive, leading to frustration. Optimizing INP ensures that users receive timely feedback, enhancing their experience.

Tools like Chrome's DevTools and web performance APIs can help measure INP by tracking interaction delays.

To improve INP, minimize main thread work, optimize event handlers, and ensure that user interactions trigger timely visual updates.

By understanding and optimizing INP, you can create web experiences that feel fast and responsive, keeping your users satisfied.
