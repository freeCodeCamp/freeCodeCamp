How to measure and improve INP?

Let's walk through a practical way to measure Interaction to Next Paint, or INP using Chrome DevTools.

First of all, let's open DevTools by pressing F12 or Right-click and click on Inspect.

Now, let's say you have a search bar on your webpage.

Imagine a user types a query, but it takes 600ms before the suggestion dropdown appears. Chrome DevTools would mark this high INP value.

You can optimize by deferring heavy JavaScript, reducing long tasks, and improving event handling. The INP would then drop to 150ms, making interactions feel instant.

Cool right! 

Now, let's look at a practical measurement technique that helps identify interaction delays so you can create a faster and smoother user experience!

First, we would open Chrome DevTools. We would do so, once again, by opening Google Chrome, navigating to a webpage that we want to analyze, pressing F12, or right clicking the page, and clicking ‘inspect'. Now, let's head to the ‘performance' tab.

(Show these steps in a slide)

Step 1: Open Chrome DevTools

1. Open Google Chrome.

2. Navigate to the webpage you want to analyze.\Open DevTools by pressing F12 or Right-click > Inspect.

3. Click on the Performance tab.

Now let's pick something to interact with. I'm going to choose to interact with this button right here. Now let's type in an input field. And now let's open a dropdown menu.

Step 2: Interact with the webpage:

1. Click a button.

2. Type in an input field.

3. Open a dropdown menu.

Now we are ready to identify the Interaction to Next Paint - or INP - in the timeline.  We are going to look for the longest interaction delay recorded.  A good INP is generally below 200ms, and a poor INP is above 500ms.

(Show this in a slide)

Good INP: Below 200ms ✅

Needs improvement: Between 200ms-500ms ⚠️

Poor INP: Above 500ms ❌

And that's it!
