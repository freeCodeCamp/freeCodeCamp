### --question--

What are the two most important rules of React hooks?

#### --distractors--

Hooks should be used sparingly, prefer built in over custom.

---

Functions should always be pure, and return an array.

---

Execute in helper functions, and after a callback.

#### --answer--

Call at the top level of, and only inside, a React function.

### --question--

#### --text--

Why do React hooks use the prefix `use`?

#### --distractors--

No particular reason at all.

---

To abstract repetitive logic.

---

It returns used state variables.

#### --answer--

Easy identification and linting.

### --question--

#### --text--

Given the following code:

```jsx
const [certificates, setCertificates] = useState([]);
```

Which is the most reliable way to update array state using the `useState` hook?

#### --distractors--

```jsx
setCertificates(previousItems => ...previousItems, "Front End");
```

---

```jsx
setCertificates("Front End");
```

---

```jsx
setCertificates().append("Front End");
```

#### --answer--

```jsx
setCertificates(previousItems => [...previousItems, "Front End"]);
```

### --question--

#### --text--

What is wrong with this function?

```jsx
function updateSpaceship() {
  setSpaceship(previousState => ({
    name: "Discovery"
  }));
}
```

#### --distractors--

Updating a `useState` variable is not allowed inside a nested function.

---

`previousState` needs to be surrounded by parenthesis.

---

Arrow functions should not be used inside a state setter function.

#### --answer--

`previousState` must be spread before `name` to ensure any other properties are not overwritten.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a key benefit of using the `useContext` hook?

#### --distractors--

Data is stored externally.

---

Allow direct access to the global `window` object.

---

Avoid overusing local state in components.

#### --answer--

Avoid prop drilling in deeply nested components.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following statements is correct?

#### --distractors--

`ref.current` is immutable.

---

`ref.current` should be mutated during rendering.

---

`ref.current` only accepts a DOM element.

#### --answer--

`ref.current` is just a plain JavaScript object.

### --question--

#### --text--

What happens when the returned value of a `useRef` hook is updated?

#### --distractors--

A re-render of the component is triggered.

---

A reference to the DOM node is saved in memory.

---

An associated click handler will be triggered.

#### --answer--

A re-render is not triggered.

### --question--

#### --text--

How many times will this code print to the console?

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Nice work!!");
}, []);
```

#### --distractors--

Three times.

---

Twice.

---

None as the dependency array is empty.

#### --answer--

Only once on initial render.

### --question--

#### --text--

What are React custom hooks typically used for?

#### --distractors--

Executing an app's most complex functionality.

---

They are not typically used, built-in hooks are preferred.

---

They replace life cycle methods from previous versions of React.

#### --answer--

Reusing stateful logic across components.

### --question--

#### --text--

When should you consider using the `useReducer` hook to manage state?

#### --distractors--

When state is shared across many components.

---

When speed and efficiency are critical.

---

To improve code readability.

#### --answer--

When a component's state is complex or tightly coupled.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled forms?

#### --distractors--

Controlled uses external API's, uncontrolled does not.

---

Controlled is where React handles form submission, uncontrolled is where JavaScript handles it.

---

Controlled is where user inputs are sanitized automatically, uncontrolled if where they are not.

#### --answer--

Controlled is where component behaviors are driven by props, uncontrolled is where component behaviors are driven by local state.

### --question--

### --question--

---
