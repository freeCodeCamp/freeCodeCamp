# --description--

You need to decide whether the current node is a better choice than the one you've already found (if any). To do this, youâ€™ll add a conditional statement inside the loop.

The condition should do two things:

- Check if the node has not been visited yet.
- Compare the known distance to the current `min_distance`.

Add a conditional that checks whether `node_no` has not been visited and whether `distances[node_no]` is less than `min_distance`.

# --hints--

You should add a conditional statement inside the loop.

```js

```

You should check if the node has not been visited yet.

```js

```

You should compare the known distance to the current `min_distance`.

```py
INF = float("inf")
adj_matrix = [
     [0, 5, 3, INF, 11, INF],
     [5, 0, 1, INF, INF, 2],
     [3, 1, 0, 1, 5, INF],
     [INF, INF, 1, 0, 9, 3],
     [11, INF, 5, 9, 0, INF],
     [INF, 2, INF, 3, INF, 0],
 ]

def shortest_path(matrix, start_node, target_node=None):
  n = len(matrix)
  distances = [INF] * n
  distances[start_node] = 0
  paths = [[node_no] for node_no in range(n)]
  visited = [False] * n
