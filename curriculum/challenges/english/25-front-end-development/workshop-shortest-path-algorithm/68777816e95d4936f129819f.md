# --description--

Before trying to update the distance to a neighbor, you need to make sure it’s actually reachable from the current node and hasn’t already been visited.

Add a conditional statement that checks two things:

- The distance between the current node and the neighbor is not equal to `INF`.
- The neighbor node has not been visited yet.

# --hints--

You should have a conditional statement inside the loop.

```js

```

You should check if the distance is not equal to `INF`.

```js

```

You should check if the neighbor node has not been visited yet.

```js

```

```py
INF = float("inf")
adj_matrix = [
     [0, 5, 3, INF, 11, INF],
     [5, 0, 1, INF, INF, 2],
     [3, 1, 0, 1, 5, INF],
     [INF, INF, 1, 0, 9, 3],
     [11, INF, 5, 9, 0, INF],
     [INF, 2, INF, 3, INF, 0],
 ]

def shortest_path(matrix, start_node, target_node=None):
  n = len(matrix)
  distances = [INF] * n
  distances[start_node] = 0
  paths = [[node_no] for node_no in range(n)]
  visited = [False] * n

  for _ in range(n):
    min_distance = INF
    current = -1
    for node_no in range(n):
      if not visited[node_no] and distances[node_no] < min_distance:
        min_distance = distances[node_no]
        current = node_no

    if current == -1:
      break
    visited[current] = True

      distance = matrix[current][node_no]
