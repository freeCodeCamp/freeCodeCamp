# --description--

Now that you've selected and marked a node as visited, it's time to look at all of its neighbors to see if we can find shorter paths to them.

Add a `for` loop that iterates through `node_no` in `range(n)` right after the line that marks the current node as visited. Add `pass` inside the loop for now.

# --hints--

You should have a `for` loop.

```js

```

Your loop should iterate through `node_no` in `range(n)`.

```js

```

You should add the `pass` statement inside the loop for now.

```js

```

# --seed--

```py
INF = float("inf")
adj_matrix = [
     [0, 5, 3, INF, 11, INF],
     [5, 0, 1, INF, INF, 2],
     [3, 1, 0, 1, 5, INF],
     [INF, INF, 1, 0, 9, 3],
     [11, INF, 5, 9, 0, INF],
     [INF, 2, INF, 3, INF, 0],
 ]

def shortest_path(matrix, start_node, target_node=None):
  n = len(matrix)
  distances = [INF] * n
  distances[start_node] = 0
  paths = [[node_no] for node_no in range(n)]
  visited = [False] * n

  for _ in range(n):
    min_distance = INF
    current = -1
    for node_no in range(n):
      if not visited[node_no] and distances[node_no] < min_distance:
        min_distance = distances[node_no]
        current = node_no

    if current == -1:
      break
    visited[current] = True
