## Terminal, Shell, and Command Line Basics

- The **command line** is a text interface where users type commands.
- A **terminal** is the application that provides access to the command line.
- A **terminal emulator** adds extra features to a terminal.
- A **shell** (such as Bash) interprets the commands entered into the terminal.
- On **Windows**, you can use **PowerShell**, **Command Prompt**, or **Microsoft Terminal**.
- On **macOS**, use the built-in **Terminal** or third-party emulators like **iTerm** or **Ghostty**.
- On **Linux**, terminal and emulator options vary by distribution, with many third-party choices like **kitty**.
- Though "terminal," "shell," and "command line" are often used interchangeably, they have specific meanings.

## Command Line Shortcuts

- **Up/Down arrows**: Cycle through previous/next commands in history.
- **Tab**: Autocomplete commands.
- **Control+L** (Linux/macOS) or typing `cls` (Windows): Clear the terminal screen.
- **Control+C**: Interrupt a running command (also used for copying in PowerShell if text is selected).
- **Control+Z** (Linux/macOS only): Suspend a task to the background; use `fg` to resume it.
- **!!**: Instantly rerun the last executed command.
- Use `--help` on commands to view usage information and available options.

## Bash Basics

**Bash** (Bourne Again Shell) is a widely used Unix-like shell.  
Key commands:

- **pwd**: Show the current directory.
- **cd**: Change directories.
  - `..` refers to the parent directory (one level up).
  - `.` refers to the current directory.
- **ls**: List files and folders.
  - `-a` flag: Show all files, including hidden files.
  - `-l` flag: Show detailed information about files.
- **less**, **more**, and **cat**: View file contents. (`more` shows one screen at a time.)
- **mkdir**: Create a new directory.
- **rmdir**: Remove an empty directory.
- **touch**: Create a new file.
- **mv**: Move or rename files.
  - Rename: `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`
  - Move: `mv filename.txt /path/to/target/`
- **cp**: Copy files.
  - `-r` flag: Recursively copy directories and their contents.
- **rm**: Delete files.
  - `-r` flag: Recursively delete directories and their contents.
- **echo**: Display a line of text or a variable’s value.
  - Use `>>` to append output to a file **without overwriting existing content** (e.g., `echo "text" >> file.txt`).
- **exit**: Exit the terminal session.
- **clear**: Clear the terminal screen.
- **find**: Search for files and directories.
  - `-name` flag: Search for files by name pattern (e.g., `find . -name "*.txt"`).

Use **man** followed by a command (e.g., `man ls`) to access detailed manual/help pages.

## Command Options and Flags

- **Options** or **flags** modify a command’s behavior.
- Options are usually prefixed with hyphens:
  - **Long form (two hyphens)**:  
    - Example: `--help`, `--version`
    - Values are attached using an equals sign, e.g., `--width=50`.
  - **Short form (one hyphen)**:  
    - Example: `-a`, `-l`
    - Values are passed with a space, e.g., `-w 50`.
    - Multiple short options can be chained together, e.g., `ls -alh`.
- Always check `--help` to understand the available options for any command.
