How can you repeat track listings in a grid layout?

In the previous lecture videos, we have been working with the `grid-template-columns` property and setting the value to a few fractional units.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  column-gap: 10px;
}
```

While the following code is completely valid, there is an easier way to repeat a section or all of your track listings.

The `repeat()` function is used to repeat a section or all of the tracks for columns or rows. This function takes in a repeat count and the tracks you wish to repeat.

Here is a revised version of the earlier example using the repeat function:

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  column-gap: 10px;
}
```

There won't be a change for the styles in the browser, but this is a more concise way to write repeated values for the columns.

The `repeat()` function will accept any valid pattern that you can use for rows or columns.

In this example, we have HTML markup for a grid container:

```html
<div class="grid-container">
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</div>
```

Then we are using the `repeat()` function to set the first and third columns to 20 pixels and the second and fourth columns to one fractional unit.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 20px 1fr);
  column-gap: 10px;
}

.grid-container div {
  height: 100px;
  background-color: darkblue;
}
```

Sometimes, you might opt to write out each individual value instead of using the `repeat()` function. But there are times when this function comes in handy, especially when you want to repeat a particular pattern for a track listing.
