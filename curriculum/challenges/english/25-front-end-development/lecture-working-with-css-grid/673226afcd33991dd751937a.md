How do the `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties work?

The `grid-column` and `grid-row` properties let you specify the horizontal and vertical placement of grid items within a grid layout.

In other words, they both allow you to control where a grid item begins and ends by referencing grid lines. These grid lines are the boundaries that separate rows and columns you have already defined using the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties.

Let's take a look at the syntaxes of both `grid-row` and `grid-column`, and also a practical example.

Here's the syntax of the `grid-row` property:

```css
grid-row: <start-line> / <end-line>;
```

And of `grid-column`:

```css
grid-column: <start-line> / <end-line>;
```

`<start-line>` is the grid line where the item starts and `<end-line>` is the grid line where the item ends. Both are 1-indexed, that is, you start counting them from 1, not 0.

Remember, grid lines for rows are generated based on the number of rows specified in the `grid-template-rows` property. The same applies to columns with the `grid-template-columns` property.

For the practical example, let's start with the lines generated by the browser when you use both the `grid-template-rows` and the `grid-template-columns` properties.

This is the HTML for that example:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="item1">1</div>
  <div class="item2">2</div>
  <div class="item3">3</div>
  <div class="item4">4</div>
</div>
```

Here's the CSS with four equal columns and three equal rows:

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); /* 4 equal columns */
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 100px); /* 3 equal rows */
  gap: 10px;
}

.grid > div {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  background: crimson;
  color: white;
  font-size: 4rem;
}
```

Inspecting the grid container (the class `grid`) shows that each row and column is bounded by two lines – a start line at the beginning of the row or column, and an end line at the end of the row or column.

You can target these lines to start using the `grid-row` and `grid-column` properties to determine where you should place an item.

Here's how you can make the first grid item occupy the first two columns:

```css
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
}
```

With this, you're saying the first grid item should start at column 1 and end just before column 3.

The first item will now occupy two columns, and the fourth item gets pushed to the second row. Cool!

If you also want the first item to occupy two rows, you can specify a `grid-row` of `1 / 3`:

```css
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
```

You can also use the `span` keyword to tell the grid item which row and column to span across. For example, `1 / 3` is the same as `1 / span 2`:

```css
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
  grid-row: 1 / span 2;
}
```

You can continue to apply this technique to any item on the grid and place them wherever you want. 

Continuing the process, here's how we made a masonry layout with the items.

This is the new HTML with three additional items:

```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="item1">1</div>
  <div class="item2">2</div>
  <div class="item3">3</div>
  <div class="item4">4</div>
  <div class="item5">5</div>
  <div class="item6">6</div>
  <div class="item7">7</div>
</div>
```

The new CSS:

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); /* 4 equal columns */
  grid-template-rows: repeat(4, 100px); /* 4 equal rows */
  gap: 10px;
}

.grid > div {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  background: crimson;
  color: white;
  font-size: 4rem;
}

.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
}

.item4 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 3;
}

.item6 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
}

.item7 {
  grid-column: 3 / span 2;
}
```
