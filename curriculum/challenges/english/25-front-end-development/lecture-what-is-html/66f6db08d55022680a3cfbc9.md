What Is HTML, and What Role Does It Play on the Web?

HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for creating web pages. When you visit a website and see content like paragraphs, headings, links, images, and videos; that's HTML. HTML represents the content and structure of a webpage through the use of elements. Here's an example of a paragraph element:

```html
<p>Hello</p>
```

Most elements will have an opening tag and a closing tag. Sometimes those tags are referred to as start and end tags. In between those two tags, you will have the content. This content can be text or other HTML elements. Both opening and closing tags start with a left angle bracket (`<`), and end with a right angle bracket (`>`), with the tag name placed between these angle brackets. Here is a closer look at just the opening and closing paragraph tags:

```html
<p>
```

```html
</p>
```

What distinguishes an opening tag from a closing tag is the forward slash (`/`) placed immediately after the left angle bracket in a closing tag. Some HTML elements do not have a closing tag. These are known as void elements. Here is an example of an image element which is a void element:

```html
<img>
```

Notice that this image element does not have the closing tag and it does not have any content. Void elements cannot have any content and only have a start tag. If you wanted to display an image, you will need to include a couple of attributes inside your image element. An attribute is a special value used to adjust the behavior for an HTML element. Here is an example of an image element with a `src`, or source, attribute:

```html
<img src="image location" />
```

The `src` attribute is used to specify the location for that image. For image elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the `alt` attribute. Here's an example of an image element with the `src` and `alt` attributes:

```html
<img src="example-cat-img-url" alt="Cat sleeping in the grass">
```

The `alt` attribute is used to provide short, descriptive text for the images. In this case, the descriptive text is a "Cat sleeping in the grass".

So, you might be wondering if HTML by itself is enough to build a website. Well, the answer is: it depends. If you're building a small practice project that only displays text and images, HTML alone might be sufficient. However, if you're creating a modern professional website, you will need to have HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML is for the content and structure. CSS is for styling. JavaScript is for adding interactivity to your web pages. A good analogy for this is to compare HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a complete building. HTML represents the blocks, concrete, and irons that make up the walls. It's the foundation that makes the building strong. CSS represents the interior and exterior design that makes the house look beautiful. JavaScript represents the electrical and water system that ensures uninterrupted access to waterÂ and electricity.
