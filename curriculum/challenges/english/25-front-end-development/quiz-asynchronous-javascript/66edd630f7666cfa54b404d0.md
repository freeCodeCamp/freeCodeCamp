---

A technique to handle errors in asynchronous code.

#### --answer--

An object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation.

### --question--

#### --text--

What does promise chaining allow you to do?

#### --distractors--

Execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel.

---

Handle synchronous operations more efficiently.

---

Retry failed operations automatically.

#### --answer--

---

`.then()`

---

`.error()`

#### --answer--

`.catch()`

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the use of the `.finally()` method in a promise?

#### --distractors--

It returns the result of the promise.

---

It stops the execution of subsequent promise handlers.

---

It retries the promise if it fails.

#### --answer--

It executes code after a promise is fulfilled or rejected, regardless of the outcome.

#### --distractors--

It creates a new promise.

---

It executes code immediately without waiting.

---

It returns the result of the promise.

#### --answer--

It pauses the execution of the function until the promise is resolved.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the purpose of the Geolocation API?

#### --distractors--

To manipulate HTML elements.

---

To create and manage map elements.

---

To control the device's camera.

---

It rejects the first promise that fails.

---

It runs all promises sequentially.

#### --answer--

It executes multiple promises concurrently and returns the results when all are resolved.

### --question--

#### --text--

How do you handle multiple asynchronous operations using async/await?

#### --distractors--

You must always use `.then()` for each operation.

---

You cannot handle multiple operations with async/await.

---

You must use callback functions for all operations.

#### --answer--
