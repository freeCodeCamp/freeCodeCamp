# --description--

Now you see that the element width is half the size of the `body`. This works well for larger devices but not as well for smaller devices.

Tailwind CSS follows a mobile-first approach in design. So if you want to create responsive designs for other devices, you can use Tailwind's responsive variants like `md` and `lg` like this:

```html
<p class="lg:w-2/3">This is a percentage width.</p>
```

The following example will set the width to `66%` of the parent element for device sizes of `1024px` and higher. 

Inside your opening `div` tag, modify your `w-1/2` so it is only applied to device sizes of `768px` and higher. You can prefix this class with the `md` variant. 

# --hints--

Your opening `div` tag should have the `md:w-1/2` utility class.

```js
const divEl = document.querySelector("div");
assert.isTrue(divEl.classList.contains("md:w-1/2"));
```

You should no longer have the `w-1/2` class in your opening `div` tag.

```js
const divEl = document.querySelector("div");
assert.isFalse(divEl.classList.contains("w-1/2"));
```
