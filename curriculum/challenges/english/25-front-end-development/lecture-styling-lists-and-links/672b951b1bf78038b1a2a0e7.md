How do the different `list-style` properties work in CSS?

In CSS, the `list-style` property is used to control the appearance of lists on a webpage.

Whether you're working with ordered lists (`ol`) or unordered lists (`ul`), the `list-style` property allows you to customize how list items are displayed.

The `list-style` property is actually a shorthand for three other properties:

- `list-style-type`
- `list-style-position`
- `list-style-image`

Each one plays a different role in defining the appearance of lists.

The `list-style-type` property allows you to define the type of bullet point or number used in a list.

For unordered lists, you can choose from several bullet styles, such as discs, circles, or squares.

For ordered lists, you can use different numbering systems, like decimal, Roman numerals, or even alphabetical characters.

Here’s an example of using `list-style-type`:

```html
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In this example, the bullet points of the unordered list are changed to squares.

The `list-style-type` property is the most commonly used of the three, as it directly affects the appearance of the bullet or numbering style in your lists.

The `list-style-position` property controls the position of the bullet or number in relation to the list item’s content. There are two values you can use: `inside` and `outside`.

When you use the value `outside`, the bullet or number appears outside the content, which is the default behavior.

And, when you use the value `inside`, the bullet or number appears inside the content, which may cause the text to wrap and align with the bullet or number.

Here’s an example of using `list-style-position`:

```html
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-position: outside;">
  <li>Item 4</li>
  <li>Item 5</li>
  <li>Item 6</li>
</ul>
```

In this example, both `inside` and `outside` values are provided for two different unordered list tags.

The `list-style-position` property can be useful when you want to control the alignment of the list content, especially in situations where you have multiple lines of text in a single list item.

The `list-style-image` property allows you to use an image as the bullet point for your list items. This can be useful for adding a unique visual style to your lists.

Here’s an example of using `list-style-image`:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    ul {
      list-style-image: url('freeCodeCamp-logo.svg');
      list-style-position: inside;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
  </ul>
</body>
```

In this example, the bullet points are replaced by a custom freeCodeCamp logo, adding a personalized touch to the list.

When using `list-style-image`, make sure the image you choose is small and appropriate for the design of your webpage. If the image is too large or complex, it can make the list harder to read.

You can combine the three properties – `list-style-type`, `list-style-position`, and `list-style-image` – into a single `list-style` shorthand property.

The order of the values in the shorthand doesn’t matter, but all three can be specified together.

Here’s an example using the shorthand property:

```html
<ul style="list-style: square inside url('https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg');">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In this example, the list items use square bullets, positioned inside the content, with a custom image as the bullet.

However, if the image is unavailable or not rendered, the square bullets will be used as a fallback.
