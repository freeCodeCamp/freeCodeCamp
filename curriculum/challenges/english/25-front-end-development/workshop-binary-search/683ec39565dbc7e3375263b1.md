# --description--

In a previous lecture, you learned about binary search and how it differs from linear search.

In this workshop, you will put that into practice by building a binary search algorithm.

To begin, create a `binary_search` function with a `search_list` and `value` parameter. `search_list` is the list of elements the function will search within, and `value` is the target the function will try to find within the `search_list`.
