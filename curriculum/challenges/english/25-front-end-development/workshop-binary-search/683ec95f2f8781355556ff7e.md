# --description--

Now that you've calculated the `mid` index, you need to actually retrieve the value from the `search_list` at that index. This value is what you will compare against your `value` paramemter, which is the target you are searching for.

Create a `value_at_middle` variable and assign it the element from `search_list` that is located at the `mid` index. You should do this right after you calculate `mid` inside the `while` loop.

```py
def binary_search(search_list, value):
    path_to_target = []
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
