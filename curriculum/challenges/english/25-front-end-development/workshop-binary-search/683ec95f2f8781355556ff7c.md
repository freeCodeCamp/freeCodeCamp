# --description--

Now that you've defined the boundaries of your search, it's time to create the loop that will perform the binary search alogorithm.

Binary search works by repeatedly narrowing down the search space. This process continues as long as there is a valid range of elements to check.

You can express this with a `while` loop that will continue as long as your `low` pointer is less than or equal to your `high` pointer.

If `low` ever becomes greater than `high`, it means the search space has become empty, and the `value` is not in the list.

Create a `while` loop with the condition `low <= high`. Inside the loop, add the `pass` keyword as a placeholder for now.

    path_to_target = []
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1
