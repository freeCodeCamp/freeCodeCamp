# --description--

The binary search algorithm you're building will not just return `True` or `False` to indicate whether the value was found or not. It will also return the path it takes to find that value. And for that, you will have a `path_to_target` variable to track the path.

Create a `path_to_target` variable and initialize it to an empty list, for a start.

# --hints--

Test 1

# --seed--
