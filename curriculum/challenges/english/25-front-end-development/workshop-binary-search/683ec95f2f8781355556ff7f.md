# --description--

Now, you should add that `value_at_middle` to the `path_to_target` list so it can be recorded in it for printing when the target `value` is found, regardless of whether it is the target or just a point in narrowing down the search. For this, you can use the `append()` method.

Test 1

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
def binary_search(search_list, value):
    path_to_target = []
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        value_at_middle = search_list[mid]
