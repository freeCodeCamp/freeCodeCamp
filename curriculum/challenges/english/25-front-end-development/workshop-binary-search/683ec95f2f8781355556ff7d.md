# --description--

To get started with the loop, you need to find the middle index of the current search space.

You can get the middle index by calculating the average of the `low` and `high` variables. You will have to use floor division to get the average after adding the two values, so the answer would always be an integer rounded down, as the indices must be integers.

Remove the `pass` keyword from your `while` loop and create a `mid` variable. For the value, add the `low` and `high` variables in brackets and floor divide them.

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
def binary_search(search_list, value):
    path_to_target = []
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1

    while low <= high:
--fcc-editable-region--
        pass
--fcc-editable-region--
```
