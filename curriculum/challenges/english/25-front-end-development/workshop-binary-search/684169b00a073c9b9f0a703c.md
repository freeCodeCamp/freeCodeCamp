# --description--

Did you notice the second function call now has the values `3, 5, 4` in the list? That indicates the binary search is working as intended.

This is how it happened: The algorithm first checked `3` as the middle of the initial list. Since `4` is greater than `3`, the search shifted to the right half. It then examined `5` as the new middle. Because `4` is less than `5`, the search moved to the left, ultimately identifying `4` as the middle of the final range.

To test the function again, call it with `[1, 3, 5, 9, 14, 22], 10` and print the call right away. This is a situation in which the value will not be found.

# --hints--

You should call the function with `binary_search([1, 3, 5, 9, 14, 22], 10)` and print it right away.

```js
({
    test: () => assert(runPython(
        `_Node(_code).has_call("print(binary_search([1, 3, 5, 9, 14, 22], 10))")`
      )
    )
})
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
def binary_search(search_list, value):
    path_to_target = []
    low = 0
    high = len(search_list) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        value_at_middle = search_list[mid]
        path_to_target.append(value_at_middle)

        if value == value_at_middle:
            return path_to_target
        elif value > value_at_middle:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return []
    
print(binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))
print(binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9], 4))
