What are `em`s and `rem`s in CSS, and when should you use them?

In the previous lecture, we learned about absolute length units like pixels. While absolute units can be helpful in certain situations, there will be times when you want to use relative units.

In this lecture, we will learn about two relative units: `em`s and `rem`s.

`em` units are relative to the font size of the element. If you are using ems for the `font-size` property, the size of the text will be relative to the font size of the parent element.

To better understand how this works, let's take a look at an example:

```html
<p class="para">I am a paragraph element</p>

<div class="blue-box"></div>
```

For the HTML, we have a paragraph and `div` element. The paragraph element has a class of `para`, and the `div` element has a class of `blue-box`.

Here is the accompanying CSS:

```css
.para {
  font-size: 20px;
  margin-bottom: 1.5em;
  border: 2px solid red;
}

.blue-box {
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

For the `para` class, we set the `font-size` to `20px` and the `margin-bottom` to `1.5em`. This means that the margin will be 1.5 times the font size of the paragraph element. `1.5em` results in 30 pixels of margin at the bottom of the paragraph. We have also set a `border` of `2px solid red` so you can see the margins better. 

For the `blue-box` class, we set the background color to `blue`, the text color to `white`, and the `padding` to `10px` on all four sides.

From the example, there'll be a clear space between the bottom of the paragraph element and the blue box.

So what happens if we remove the `font-size` property from the `para` class?

Well, the bottom margin will be relative to the font size of the parent element. In this case, the parent element is the body element, which has a default font size of `16px`.

Good use cases for `em`s would be when you are working with modular components like buttons or cards. By using `em` units, you can ensure that all aspects of the component (such as padding, margin, and borders) scale proportionally with the font size, keeping consistent proportions.

So, up until this point, we have been setting the font size for an element using pixels. But that does present some challenges for users.

Inside your browser settings, you can control the default font size.

For those with visual impairments, they may increase the font size to make it easier to read. But if you are setting pixels for the font sizes in your web designs, the text will not scale proportionally with the rest of the content.

One way to address this issue is to use `rem` units for typography. A `rem` unit is relative to the font size of the root element, which is the `html` element. 

By default, the font size of the `html` element is `16px`. If the user increases the font size in their browser settings, the font size of the `html` element will increase, and all rem units will scale proportionally.

Here is an example of using the `rem` unit for the font size instead of pixels:

```css
.para {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5em;
  border: 2px solid red;
}
```

By setting the font size to `1.2rem`, the font size of the paragraph element will be 1.2 times the font size of the root element. If the user hasn't changed the default font size, the font size of the paragraph element will be `19.2px` because it is 1.2 times `16px`.

So when should you use `rem` units? `rem` units are preferred over pixels for typography because they scale proportionally with the user's browser settings. This makes your content more accessible to users with visual impairments.

`rem` units can also help maintain consistent spacing and layout across different elements.
