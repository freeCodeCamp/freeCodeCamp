# --description--

Camperbot just started learning how to code and is trying to build a profile page. They asked a friend to look over their code so far and their friend said it had tons of errors.

Your job is to fix all of camperbot's errors so they can continue to build their profile page.

**User Stories:**

1. Camperbot is not following best practices and has multiple `h1` elements on the page. Remove all `h1` elements except for the first one.
1. Camperbot is trying to use a `heading2` element. But that element does not exist. Fix that mistake so it uses the correct heading element for subheadings just below an `h1`. 
1. Camperbot is trying to add some paragraphs but is using the wrong element. Fix these errors to use the correct HTML element for paragraphs.
1. Camperbot is using an `h3` element for the `Background and Interests` subheading but it has a syntax error. Spot the issue and resolve it.
