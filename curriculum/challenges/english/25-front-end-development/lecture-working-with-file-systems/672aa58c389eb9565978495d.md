How to use file management applications?

A file management application is a way to easily store, organize, and edit your files on your computer. Whether you use a Mac or Windows computer, there are built-in applications you can use to organize your files.

If you have a Windows computer, the default file manager is the File Explorer. This is used to browse, search, and manage files and folders, as well as perform file operations like copying, moving, and deleting.

To find the File Explorer, you can go to the Start menu or press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.

To pin a folder, you can right click with your mouse and select "Pin". To move a file or folder, you first need to select it, then select "Cut" and then navigate to the new location to paste it.

If you have a Mac computer, the default file manager is the Finder. This provides access to local and remote files, supports file previews, and offers a variety of organizational features like tags and Smart Folders.

To access the Finder on your Mac, go to the Dock at the bottom and click on the Finder icon.

You will notice a sidebar on the left-hand side where your favorite folders are located.

One way to organize your files, is to use tags. To tag a file or folder, you can select the item in the Finder and then right click with your mouse. You will see the "Tags..." option in the dropdown and you can apply a custom colored tag.

To search for tagged items, you can scroll to the bottom of the sidebar and click on the corresponding colored tag, or you can search for the tag by color name in the search field.

Another way to organize your files is to use smart folders. Smart folders are collections of files that are automatically organized based on criteria you set, such as file type, date, or keywords.

Whether you're using File Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac, these applications provide flexibility to manage your files with features like tags, search, and Smart Folders.
