How to create, move, and delete files and folders using the Explorer or Finder?

To create a file on Windows using the Explorer, you can click on the "New" option at the top right. This will show you a list of the different types of files that you can create. 

You can also create files in their corresponding applications. Let's create a text file to show you the process.

When you click on "New" and select the file type, you will see a new text file in your current folder with a default name. You can rename it if you'd like.

The process of creating folders is exactly the same. Click the "New" button at the top right and then select the "Folder" option or right-click on an empty spot and go to "New." Then, select the "Folder" option. You'll see a new empty folder in your current location.

You can rename files and folders by selecting them and clicking on the "Rename" option at the top. When current name of the file is highlighted, you can start writing the new name of the file. Press Enter to confirm the changes.

Alternatively, you can right-click on the file or folder and select the "Rename" option or use the F2 keyboard shortcut. Write the new name and press Enter to confirm the changes. 

You can move a file or folder to another folder by dragging and dropping it into the destination folder, if you have it opened it as a tab. 

You can also select the file or folder and select the "Cut" option at the top.

Then, go to the destination folder and paste it by clicking the "Paste" button at the top. If you copied or cut the file previously, this button will be enabled.

You can also do this by right-clicking on an empty spot and then clicking on the paste icon. This will remove the file or folder from its original location.

To delete a file or folder, click on it and then click on the Trash icon at the top. You will also find a "Delete" option if you right-click on it.

Great. Now let's see how you can do this on macOS using Finder. 

Finder is the default file manager on macOS.

To create a file on macOS, you need to open an application that lets you create the type of document that you need to create. Currently, there isn't a built-in way to create a file directly on Finder.

For example, to create a simple plain text file, you can open TextEdit and save your file. The process works exactly the same for any type of file.

There are many ways to open TextEdit. One of them is to go to Launchpad. Then, search for an app where you can create the type of file that you're interested in. In this case, that would be "TextEdit." Click on the icon to open the app.

Once you are inside the app, you should see an option to save your file in the App menu. This menu is located at the top-right, next to the Apple menu icon.

In one of the App menu options, you should see a command to save the file. This is usually under the File menu.

Next to it, you will see the keyboard shortcut for saving your file. This is usually `Command + S` on macOS.

When you are saving the file for the first time, you should see a dialog window, where you can write the name of the file and choose a location.

Usually, the file extension is added by the application automatically but you can change it before saving the file.

After saving the file, you can open Finder by clicking on the Finder icon in the Dock. You should see your new file in the folder where you saved it.

To create a new folder, you should go to the location where you want to create that new folder and rick-click on an empty spot. You will see a list of options. The first option is "New Folder."

If you click on it, you can assign a name to your new folder. Write the name and press Enter to confirm.

There are multiple ways to move files and folders in Finder. If you need to move them to a folder listed in your Finder "Favorites" section, you can just drag and drop it.

If you need to move it to a different folder, you have two options. 

You can either open the destination folder as a tab and drag and drop the file or folder into the tab.

Or you can use keyboard shortcuts. First, copy the file with `Command + C`, go to the new folder, and then use `Command + Option + V` to paste the file or folder in that location. This will also remove it from the original folder.

To delete a file or folder, you can right-click on it and select "Move to trash."

You can also drag and drop them into the trash icon on the Dock. This is equivalent.

When the file or folder is in the trash can, you can right-click on it to delete it immediately or you can empty the trash to remove all the deleted files and folders permanently.

Knowing how to create, move, and delete files and folders on Windows and macOS is very important. By mastering these skills, you can organize your files, locate them quickly, and free up storage on your computer by deleting unnecessary files.
