What are ARIA roles?

ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications.

ARIA roles specify the semantic meaning of HTML elements. They're essential for making web content accessible to people who use assistive technologies, like screen readers.

HTML has semantic and non-semantic elements, based on whether they convey meaning about their content.

Many semantic HTML elements already have an ARIA role assigned by default. For example, the `button` element has a default ARIA role of `button`. 

But non-semantic elements don't have a role. For example, screen readers will not know how to interpret the purpose of a `div` if you don't specify its role explicitly.

To specify the ARIA role of an element, you just need to add the `role` attribute, like this `role="ARIA role"`, where value is the name of a role in the ARIA specification.

It is important to note that specifying a role on an element only does one thing: It informs assistive technology of the purpose of the element. It does not add any functionality or behavior to the element. If people expect a role to behave a certain way, it is up to you, the developer, to add that expected behavior. For example, adding a `role` of `button` to a `div` does not automatically make it clickable with a mouse or usable with a keyboard. It is the responsibility of the developer to add the expected behavior that allows the `div` to act like a button, and in most cases, it is just better to use the `button` element.

There are six main categories of ARIA roles:

- Document structure roles
- Widget roles
- Landmark roles
- Live region roles
- Window roles
- And Abstract roles

Let's take a look at them in more detail.

Document structure roles define the overall structure of the web page. With these roles, assistive technologies can understand the relationships between different sections and help users navigate the content.

However, most of the document structure roles are not used in modern web development because browsers already support equivalent semantic HTML elements, which should be prioritized whenever possible.

You should specify the roles that don't have an equivalent semantic element. For example: `toolbar`, `tooltip`, `feed`, `math`, `presentation`, `none`, and `note`.

There are other similar roles but these are the most commonly used ones. This is an example of a `div` with the `math` ARIA role. The `div` contains a mathematical equation.

```html
<div role="math" aria-label="x squared + y squared = 3">
  x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 3
</div>
```

You'll also notice that the `div` has an `aria-label` attribute. The value of this attribute should be a string that represents the expression.

Widget roles define the purpose and functionality of interactive elements, like scrollbars.

Examples of widget roles include `scrollbar`, `searchbox`, `separator` (when focusable), `slider`, `spinbutton`, `switch`, `tab`, `tabpanel`, and `treeitem`.

Some of these roles have equivalent semantic elements. You should prioritize the semantic element over the role if there is one. For example, you should favor using the HTML `button` element over adding a `role` of `button` to a `div`.

Landmark roles classify and label the primary sections of a web page. Screen readers use them to provide convenient navigation to important sections of a page. You should use them sparingly to keep the overall layout simple and easy to understand. Examples of landmark roles are `banner`, `complementary`, `contentinfo`, `form`, `main`, `navigation`, `region`, and `search`. Each of these roles has a corresponding HTML equivalent, such as `header`, `footer`, `aside`, `form`, `main`, `nav`, `section`, and `search`. If you use the proper HTML elements to define the sections of your page then it is not necessary to explicitly add the `role` attribute to these elements.

Live region roles define elements with content that will change dynamically. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can announce changes to users with visual disabilities. These roles include: `alert`, `log`, `marquee`, `status`, and `timer`.

Window roles define sub-windows, like pop up modal dialogues. These roles include `alertdialog` and `dialog`. Please note that it is now considered a best practice to use the HTML `dialog` element and its associated JavaScript methods instead of manually creating a dialog.

And finally, we have abstract roles. These roles help organize the document. They're only meant to be used internally by the browser, not by developers, so you should know that they exist but you shouldn't use them on your websites or web applications.

With ARIA roles, you can create accessible and inclusive websites and web applications. They provide semantic information about the purpose and function of HTML elements.

Screen readers and other assistive technologies use this information to help users understand the content of your page and set expectations for how to use it, which helps ensure  that everyone can have a great user experience.
