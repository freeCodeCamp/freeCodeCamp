How can you capture video and audio from a local device?

Instead of playing audio and video, you may sometimes want to capture audio or video. The Media Capture and Streams API, or the MediaStream API, allows you to do this.

In order to use the API, however, you need to create the `MediaStream` object. You could do this with the constructor, but it would not be tied to the user's hardware. Instead, the `mediaDevices` property of the global `navigator` object has a `getUserMedia()` method for you to use.

This method accepts a single `constraints` object which defines the type of media you want to receive. This object has an `audio` and `video` property, reflecting audio and video streams. These properties can be `false`, if you do not want to receive that type of stream, `true` if you do, or objects defining additional constraints.

For example, you can require a specific resolution of video output:

```js
window.navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: {
      min: 1280,
      ideal: 1920,
      max: 3840
    },
    height: {
      min: 720,
      ideal: 1080,
      max: 2160
    }
  }
});
```

This constraint object specifies minimum and maximum resolutions for the video feed. The `ideal` property specifies the resolution you'd most like to have â€“ and the stream will provide the resolution closest to your ideal.

Once you've created your MediaStream (assuming the user approves the automated request to access their hardware), you can use the stream data however you need.

Note that `getUserMedia()` returns a Promise, which means you will either need a callback function to consume the stream, or use async/await syntax. You will learn more about Promises and asynchronous programming in future lectures. 

Here's a basic example which renders the user's webcam feed to the page.

```js
const video = document.querySelector("video");
const stream =
  await window.navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
video.srcObject = stream;
await video.play();
```

It is worth noting that this API does not offer access to screen capture. You'll learn about that API in the next lecture.
