What is the `HTMLMediaElement` API and how does it work?

The `HTMLMediaElement` API is a powerful tool to control the behavior of audio and video elements on your page. It extends the base `HTMLElement` interface, so you have access to the base properties as well as these helpful methods.

You've already explored some of the methods in a previous lecture about the `Audio` element, such as `play()` and `pause()`. These same methods are available on video elements as well.

There are some other helpful methods, such as the `addTextTrack()` method. This method allows you to specify a text track to associate with the media element which is especially helpful for adding subtitles to a video.

Or the `fastSeek()` method, which allows you to move the playback position to a specific time within the media.

The `HTMLMediaElement` API also provides access to some new events that a standard element does not have.

The `play` and `pause` events are fired when the media starts and stops playing. The `ended` event fires when the end of the media has been reached.

The `waiting` event fires when playback is automatically paused due to data buffering.

And the `canplay` and `canplaythrough` events fire when the media can be partially played, or played in totality.

The `HTMLMediaElement` offers a great deal of control over your interactive media, and we've only scratched the surface. I encourage you to explore and experiment with the API to find the best ways to integrate it with your applications.
