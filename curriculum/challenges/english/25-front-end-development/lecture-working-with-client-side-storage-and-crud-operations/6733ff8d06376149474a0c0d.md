What is the `Cache` API, and how does it work?

The `Cache` API is used to store network requests and responses, making web applications work more efficiently and even function offline. It is part of the broader Service Worker API and is critical for creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that can work under unreliable or slow network conditions. 

Before we continue with the `Cache` API, we first need to understand how service workers, PWAs, and network requests work on a basic level. 

A network request is a request made by a web browser or application to a server to retrieve data or resources over the internet. For example, when you visit a website, your browser sends a network request to the web server to get the files (such as HTML, images, or videos) needed to display the page.

A service worker is a special type of JavaScript file that runs in the background of a web application, separate from the main browser thread. It acts as a middleman between the web page and the network, allowing developers to intercept network requests, cache resources, and handle things like push notifications or background sync.

A PWA, or Progressive Web App, is a type of web application that uses modern web technologies to provide a native app-like experience on the web. PWAs are designed to work reliably on any device, regardless of network conditions, and can be accessed through a browser or installed on a user's device like a traditional app. 

Now that we have a better understanding of service workers, PWAs, and network requests, we can dive deeper into the Cache API.

The `Cache` API is a storage mechanism that stores `Request` and `Response` objects. When a request is made to a server, the application can store the response and later retrieve it from the cache instead of making a new network request. This reduces load times, saves bandwidth, and improves the overall user experience.

The browser provides a storage area known as `CacheStorage`, where developers can save key-value pairs of network requests and their corresponding responses.

With the `Cache-Control` header, developers can specify how long a cached resource should remain stored, as well as whether it should be revalidated or served directly from the cache. 

By using the `Cache` API, developers can build offline-first web applications, allowing a PWA, for example, to serve cached assets when the user is disconnected from the network.
