What is `IndexedDB`, and how does it work?

`IndexedDB` is a tool for storing structured data in the browser. This is built into modern web browsers, allowing web apps to store and fetch JavaScript objects efficiently.

Unlike other storage mechanisms like `localStorage`, which is limited to storing strings, `IndexedDB` can store JavaScript objects, files, and pretty much any other type of data. This makes it easy for web applications that need to work with large and complex data structures.

Now, let's look at how `IndexedDB` works. 

The first step is to open a database. Here's an example:

```js
let request = indexedDB.open("Sample DB", 1);

request.onerror = function(event) {
  console.log("Error opening database");
};

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  let db = event.target.result;
  console.log("Database opened successfully");
};
```

In this code, we're opening a database named `"Sample DB"` with version 1. We provide two callback functions: one for handling errors, and another for when the database is successfully opened. The `db` object we get in the success callback is what we'll use to interact with the database.

If you check the browser dev tools application interface, you will see your `Sample DB` in the `IndexedDb` section has been opened. Once you have your database open, you can start working with object stores.

Object stores in IndexedDB are similar to tables in traditional databases. They hold the actual data you want to store. Here's how to create an object store: 

```js
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  let db = event.target.result;
  let objectStore = db.createObjectStore("customers", { keyPath: "id" });
};
```

This code creates an object store named `"customers"` with `"id"` as its key path. The key path is like a primary key in a traditional database - it's used to uniquely identify each record.

To add data to our object store, we'd do something like this. The `db` in this example represents the `IndexedDB` database instance.

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(["customers"], "readwrite");
let objectStore = transaction.objectStore("customers");
let request = objectStore.add({ id: 1, name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" });

request.onerror = function(event) {
  console.log("Error adding data");
};

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  console.log("Data added successfully");
};
```

This code adds a new customer to our `"customers"` object store. We start a transaction (which is how we group database operations), get a reference to our object store, and then add our data.

Retrieving data works in a similar way. We start a transaction, get our object store, and then use methods like `get` to retrieve data:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction(["customers"]);
let objectStore = transaction.objectStore("customers");
let request = objectStore.get(1);

request.onerror = function(event) {
  console.log("Error retrieving data");
};

request.onsuccess = function(event) {
  console.log("Customer:", request.result);
};
```

This code retrieves the customer with `id` `1` from our `"customers"` object store.

One of the key features of `IndexedDB` is that it's asynchronous.

This means that when you interact with `IndexedDB`, operations don't block the main thread of the web application. This ensures that your web application remains responsive even when dealing with large amounts of data.

While `IndexedDB` provides powerful capabilities, it has a steeper learning curve compared to other simpler storage API options which can be challenging for beginners. However, for applications that need to handle large amounts of structured data on the client-side, `IndexedDB` offers unparalleled capabilities.
