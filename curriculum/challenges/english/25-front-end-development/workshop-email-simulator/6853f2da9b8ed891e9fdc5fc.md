# --description--

Python has special methods that start and end with double underscores (called 'dunder methods'). One useful dunder method is `__str__`, which defines how an object should be displayed when converted to a string or printed.

For your email simulator, you'll use `__str__` to create a brief summary of each email that shows whether it's read or unread, who sent it, the subject, and when it was received.

Add a `__str__` method to your `Email` class. Within the method, use conditional expression to assign `Read` to a variable `status` if the email is read and `Unread` if it is not. Then, return a formatted string that includes the read status, sender name, subject, and formatted timestamp as follows:

```py
[status] From: [sender name] | Subject: [subject] | Time: [Time in the format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M']
```

# --hints--

You should define a `__str__` method in the `Email` class.

```js

```

You should use conditional expression to assign `status` based on `self.read`.

```js

```

You should return the email summary string formatted correctly.

```js

```

class Email:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, subject, body):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.subject = subject
        self.body = body
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.read = False

    def mark_as_read(self):
        self.read = True

    def display_full_email(self):
        self.mark_as_read()
        print('\n--- Email ---')
        print(f'From: {self.sender.name}')
        print(f'To: {self.receiver.name}')
        print(f'Subject: {self.subject}')
        print(f"Received: {self.timestamp.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}")
        print(f'Body: {self.body}')
        print('------------\n')
