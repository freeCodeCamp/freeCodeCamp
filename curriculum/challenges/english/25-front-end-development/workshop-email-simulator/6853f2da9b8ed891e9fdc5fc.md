# --description--

The `mark_as_read` method is working correctly. Remove the existing `display_full_email` call and the following print statement.

Python has special methods that start and end with double underscores (called 'dunder methods'). One useful dunder method is `__str__`, which defines how an object should be displayed when converted to a string or printed.

For your email simulator, you'll use `__str__` to create a brief summary of each email that shows whether it's read or unread, who sent it, the subject, and when it was received.

Add a `__str__` method to your `Email` class. Within the method, use conditional expression to assign `Read` to a variable `status` if the email is read and `Unread` if it is not. Then, return a formatted string that includes the read status, sender name, subject, and formatted timestamp as follows:

```py
[status] From: [sender name] | Subject: [subject] | Time: [Time in the format '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M']
```

Test it by printing the `email_obj`.

# --hints--

You should define a `__str__` method in the `Email` class.

```js

```

You should use conditional expression to assign `status` based on `self.read`.

```js

```

You should return the email summary string formatted correctly.

```js

```

You should print the `email_obj` to see the output of the `__str__` method.

```js

```
