# --description--

Now you'll create your first class called `Email`. A *class* is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines what properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) objects of that type will have.

Recall that a class is defined as follows:

```py
class ClassName:
    # class body
```

In your email simulator, each email will be an object created from the `Email` class. This class will store information about who sent the email, who received it, the subject, and the message body.

Create a class named `Email` using the `class` keyword. Remember that class names in Python should start with a capital letter. Add `pass` keyword in the class body for now.

# --hints--

You should create a class named `Email`.

```js

You should use the `class` keyword followed by `Email` and a colon.

```js

```

You should add the `pass` statement inside the class body for now.
