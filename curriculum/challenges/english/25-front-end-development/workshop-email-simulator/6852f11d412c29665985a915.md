# --description--

<!-- add new step -->
Now, test the `display_full_email` method you created in the `Email` class. Use the method on the existing `Email` object `email_obj` and print it. You'll see the status is now `True`.

solution:

```py
email_obj.mark_as_read()
print(email_obj.read)
```
<!-- end -->

Next, you'll create a method to display the full email content. This method will show all the email details in a nicely formatted way, similar to how you'd see an email in your email client.

Create a method called `display_full_email` that takes only `self` as a parameter. Inside this method, using the `mark_as_read` method, mark the email as read since the user is viewing it.

# --hints--

You should define a method named `display_full_email`in the `Email` classthat takes `self` as a parameter.

```js

```

Your `display_full_email` method should call `self.mark_as_read()`.

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
import datetime

class Email:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, subject, body):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.subject = subject
        self.body = body
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.read = False

    def mark_as_read(self):
        self.read = True
