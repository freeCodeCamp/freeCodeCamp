<!-- add new step -->

As the constructor method is now complete, test it by creating an `Email` object named `email_obj`. Pass the following values to it:

- sender="jessica@example.com",
- receiver="ilenia@example.com",
- subject="Meeting Reminder",
- body="Hi Ilenia, just reminding you about our meeting at 3 PM today."

Print the values of `sender`, `receiver`, `subject`, `body`, `timestamp`, and `read` attributes of the `email_obj` object in separate print statements to see the output on the console.



Solution:

```py
email_obj = Email(
    sender="jessica@example.com",
    receiver="ilenia@example.com",
    subject="Meeting Reminder",
    body="Hi Ilenia, just reminding you about our meeting at 3 PM today."
)

print(email_obj.sender)
print(email_obj.receiver)
print(email_obj.subject)
print(email_obj.body)
print(email_obj.timestamp)
print(email_obj.read)
```


<!-- end -->

Now you'll add a method to mark an email as read. Recall that a *method* is a function that belongs to a class and can be called on objects of that class.

When someone opens an email, you want to change its status from unread to read. This method will be simple - it just needs to set the `read` attribute to `True`.

Add a method called `mark_as_read` to your `Email` class. This method should take only `self` as a parameter and set the `read` attribute to `True`.

# --hints--

You should define a method named `mark_as_read` in the `Email` class.

```js

```

Your `mark_as_read` method should only take `self` as a parameter.

```js

```

The method should set `self.read` to `True`.

```js

```

```py
import datetime

class Email:
    def __init__(self, sender, receiver, subject, body):
        self.sender = sender
        self.receiver = receiver
        self.subject = subject
        self.body = body
        self.timestamp = datetime.datetime.now()
        self.read = False
