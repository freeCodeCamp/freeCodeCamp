# --description--

Every class needs a special method called `__init__` (also known as a constructor). This method is automatically called when you create a new object from the class. It's used to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes.

Your `Email` class will need to store information about the sender, receiver, subject, and body of the email. The `__init__` method will take these as parameters and assign them to the object.

Inside your `Email` class, remove the existing `pass` keyword and create the `__init__` method that takes `self`, `sender`, `receiver`, `subject`, and `body` as parameters. Add the `pass` keyword inside the method body for now.

# --hints--

You should define an `__init__` method inside the `Email` class.

```js

```

Your `__init__` method should have parameters: `self`, `sender`, `receiver`, `subject`, and `body`.

```js

```

You should have the `pass` keyword only inside the `__init__` method.

```js

```
