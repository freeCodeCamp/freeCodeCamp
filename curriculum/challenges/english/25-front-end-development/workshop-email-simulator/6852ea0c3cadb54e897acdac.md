# --description--

In this workshop, you are going to build an *Email Simulator*. This will be a Python program that simulates sending, receiving, and managing emails between different users. You'll learn about classes, objects, and how to organize code in an object-oriented way.

To start building your email simulator, you'll need to import the `datetime` module. This module provides classes for working with dates and times, which you'll use to timestamp your emails.

At the top of your file, import the `datetime` module.
