How can you remove properties from an object?

There are several ways to remove properties from an object, with the `delete` operator being the most straightforward and commonly used method.

When you use `delete`, it removes the selected property from the object. Here's an example of how to use the `delete` operator:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  job: "Engineer"
};

delete person.job;

console.log(person.job); // undefined
```

In this example, we start with a `person` object that has three properties: `name`, `age`, and `job`. Then, we use the `delete` operator to remove the `job` property. After the deletion, the `person` object no longer has the `job` property.

Another way to remove properties is by using destructuring assignment with rest parameters. This approach doesn't actually delete the property, but it creates a new object without the specified properties:

```js
const person = {
  name: "Bob",
  age: 25,
  job: "Designer",
  city: "New York"
};

const { job, city, ...remainingProperties } = person;

// { name: "Bob", age: 25 }
console.log(remainingProperties);
```

In this example, we use destructuring to extract `job` and `city` from the `person` object, and collect the remaining properties into a new object called `remainingProperties`. This creates a new object without the `job` and `city` properties.

Understanding how to remove properties from objects is an important skill in JavaScript programming. It allows you to manipulate objects dynamically, and clean up unnecessary data.
