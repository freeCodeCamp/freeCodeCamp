# --description--

I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and founder of freeCodeCamp.org.

Our charity's mission is to create free learning resources to help people learn math, programming, and computer science. And that's precisely what we've done for you here.

This free, verified certification includes thousands of hours of lectures, interactive labs, and projects. You're going to build dozens of apps from scratch.

This is real coding. Everything's fully interactive. You'll immediately apply concepts as you learn them. And you'll get plenty of practice and spaced repetition along the way.

Over the past decade, tens of thousands of people who've learned to code using freeCodeCamp have gotten their first developer jobs. Many of these people don't even have a university degree.

But I'm not going to sugarcoat it: learning to code is hard. You're going to spend many nights and weekends sharpening your skills by building projects.

The good news is that the freeCodeCamp community is with you all the way. You can get help anytime you get stuck. Just use the freeCodeCamp forum or the freeCodeCamp Discord. Or you can use the search bar and search through thousands of reference articles created by the community.

In the next lecture, I'll explain how the freeCodeCamp curriculum and how the certifications work.
