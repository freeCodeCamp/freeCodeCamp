To make it through something as rigorous as the freeCodeCamp curriculum, you'll need to not only work hard â€“ you'll need to work smart.

Over the years, I've talked with thousands of people who've learned to code and gotten developer jobs. Here are some tips that have worked for them.

Tip number 1: pace yourself. Learning to code is a marathon, not a sprint. Remember that it's better to code 30 minutes every day of the week, than to try and cram all your learning into one day. This is thanks to the important role that sleep plays in learning.

The freeCodeCamp curriculum already incorporates all those learning concepts I mentioned earlier: spaced repetition, interleaving practice, active recall. All you need to do is sit down and work through the curriculum consistently every day.

This is easier said than done. Most people who start this curriculum will at some point stop. Hopefully, some of those people will come back and finish in the future. But let's talk about you. We want you to finish what you start. And the best advice I have is to remember to pace yourself.

Tip number 2: routine is your friend. If you make a habit of waking up 30 minutes earlier every day, you can get in a coding session before you go to work. After a few weeks of doing this, it just becomes part of your routine. You don't really have to think too much about it, or expend any additional willpower. It's just something that you do.

Now, I understand that you're probably busy. I wish I could tell you that there was just some magic book that you could buy, and that would be enough. The reason buying a book feels so good is that it feels like you're also buying the time to read it. But there's no magic involved in learning to code. You've got to put in the time. You've got to put in the reps at the keyboard. 

I'll tell you this: if you can code for even 30 minutes a day, you're going to make serious gains over the course of a year.

Tip number 3: Use the Pomodoro technique. Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato. In Italy they have these tomato shaped clocks that you set for 25 minutes.

Sitting down to code isn't easy. It takes willpower. So to make it easier to sit down and start that coding, just tell yourself that you're going to code for 25 minutes. Set a timer. Then, once you've finished 25 minutes, you can take a break. But by this point, you may be so deep into your coding session, that you don't even need to take a break.

The Pomodoro technique makes it a lot easier to get started.

By the way, you'll code your own Pomodoro clock app as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

Final tip: remember to get plenty of sleep. You'll learn best when you're at your best. Sleep plays a vital role in how your brain learns. I encourage you to try to sleep at least 8 hours each night.

And with that, you're ready to dive into the curriculum and start working toward earning your freeCodeCamp verified certification. Happy coding!
