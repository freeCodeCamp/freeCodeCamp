freeCodeCamp offers free, verified certifications. We've structured our curriculum to give you tons of practice with each tool and each concept, to help you prepare for your certification exams.

You'll watch short lectures and answer comprehension-check questions about them.

You'll code your way through step-by-step interactive workshops.

And you'll build dozens of projects from scratch.

Along the way, you'll pass dozens of quizzes and exams. And you'll prove to us — and you'll prove to yourself — that you've mastered these tools and concepts.

Toward the end of the curriculum, you'll build your own unique capstone project that we'll review and give you feedback on. This will be a project worthy of adding to your professional portfolio.

After you've completed the curriculum, passed the final exam, and built your capstone project, you can claim your free verified certification.

Your certification will have its own unique verification URL, unique serial number, and unique QR code. You can add your certification to your résumé, LinkedIn, CV, and portfolio website.

At freeCodeCamp, we take developer education seriously. There are no shortcuts. You'll spend thousands of hours completing the curriculum.

Even if life gets in the way, and you have to stop for a while, we'll be here, ready to help you push forward with your skills.

You need to work hard, yes. But you also need to work smart.

Before we dive into the curriculum, I'm going to share some insight into how most people learn effectively, and how most people work smart.
