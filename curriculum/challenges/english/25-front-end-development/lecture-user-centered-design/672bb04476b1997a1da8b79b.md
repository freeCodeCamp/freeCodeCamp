What is deferred/lazy registration in UI design?

Lazy registration is a UI design pattern that allows users to browse and interact with your application without having to register. A good example of this would be an e-commerce site. Users should be able to browse through the products and add a few items to their cart. Then, if they are interested in purchasing, they will need to register.

The reason is that users need to see the value your site offers before they are willing to provide their information and register. When designing your applications, users should be able to see the value and feel like the application is safe to provide their information. Otherwise, they will not be willing to register and you will lose potential customers.

You will need to make sure to communicate that the user's sensitive data will be protected and secure. In later modules, we will discuss how to secure your application and protect your user's data.

Another good example of lazy registration would be YouTube. YouTube is a video sharing platform with millions of videos on everything from tech, pop culture, and gaming. If you visit YouTube, users can watch as many videos as they like without needing to sign in or register. However, if they want to like, comment, or subscribe to a channel, they will need to register.

If the user likes the content they are watching or wants to participate in the conversations, then they will be more willing to register. Lazy registration is a useful design pattern that allows users to see the value of your application before they are willing to provide their information.

The next time you are designing an application, consider using lazy registration to increase user engagement and retention.
