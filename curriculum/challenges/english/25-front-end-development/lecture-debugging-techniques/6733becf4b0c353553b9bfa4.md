How does the `debugger` statement work?

The `debugger` statement is a powerful JavaScript tool that lets you pause your code at a specific line to investigate what's going on in the program. When used correctly, the `debugger` statement can save you a lot of time trying to figure out why something is not working as it should.

JavaScript executes your code from top to bottom. While JavaScript executes your code and hits a `debugger` statement, it immediately pauses execution at that line. This gives you the chance to inspect variables, check functions, and the flow of of the code in general.

With that, you can see exactly what is going right or wrong. However, this only happens if your browser's developer tools are open. Otherwise, the `debugger` statement is ignored, and the code continues to run as usual.

In addition, when you use the `debugger` statement, modern browsers will pause code execution at the specified line. They also allow you to resume execution by clicking the play button, but the page itself does not automatically reload unless manually triggered.

To use the `debugger` statement, place it at the line in which you want the code execution to pause. Here's an example:

```js
let firstNumber = 5;
let secondNumber = 10;
debugger; // Code execution pauses here
let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
console.log(sum);
```

With this example, if you don't have the console open before the code runs and you eventually open it, you'll see `15` in there. While the console is open and you reload the page, the execution is paused for you so you can inspect the code.Â 

Here's a more complex example:

```js
function calculateTotalPrice(price, discountPercentage) {
 debugger
 let discountAmount = (price * discountPercentage) / 100
 let totalPrice = price - discountAmount

 console.log(`Original Price: ${price}`)
 console.log(`Discount Amount: ${discountAmount}`)
 console.log(`Total Price after Discount: ${totalPrice}`)

 return totalPrice
}

let price = 100
let discount = 15

let finalPrice = calculateTotalPrice(price, discount)
console.log(`Final Price: ${finalPrice}`);
```

In this example the `debugger` statement is placed at the top of the `calculateTotalPrice`. When the function is called, the function execution will be paused.

If you reload the page with the console opened, you'll see that the page keeps reloading, confirming that the execution of the code is only paused, not stopped. If you want the execution to continue, you can click the play button.

As you continue to build out your JavaScript programs, test out the `debugger` statement in your code to see how it can help you better understand the flow of execution, inspect variables in real-time, and quickly identify where things might be going wrong.
