# --description--

Welcome to your code editor, where you can write HTML code.

Find line 1 in the editor and type this text:

```md
Welcome to freeCodeCamp
```

When you are done, click the "check your code" button to see if it's correct.

# --hints--

You should have the text `Welcome to freeCodeCamp` in your editor. Double-check for spelling.

```js
// purposefully providing forgiveness in spacing and casing to remove some friction and
// keep camper retention this early on.
assert.match(code, /welcome\s*to\s*freecodecamp/i)
```
