# --description--

HTML is made up of elements. The first one you will use is the `h1` element:

```html
<h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp</h1>
```

It starts with an opening tag (`<h1>`), ends with a closing tag (`</h1>`), and has the text it will display in between the tags.

Turn your `Welcome to freeCodeCamp` text into an `h1` element by adding an opening tag in front of it, and a closing tag after it.

# --hints--

Your `h1` element should have an opening tag. Opening tags have this syntax: `<elementName>`.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector("h1"));
```

Your `h1` element should have a closing tag. Closing tags have this syntax: `</elementName>`.

```js
assert.match(code, /<\/h1\s*\>/);
```

Your `h1` element's text should be `Welcome to freeCodeCamp`. You have either omitted the text, have a typo, or it is not between the `h1` element's opening and closing tags.

```js
// purposefully removing friction for early users to help improve retention in early lessons
// this if very forgiving of spaces and casing
assert.match(code, /\<h1\s*\>\s*Welcome\s*to\s*freeCodeCamp\s*\<\/h1\s*\>/i);
```

You appear to be using a browser extension that is modifying the page. Be sure to turn off all browser extensions.

```js
if(__checkForBrowserExtensions){
  assert.isAtMost(document.querySelectorAll("script").length, 2);
  assert.equal(document.querySelectorAll("style").length, 1);
  assert.equal(document.querySelectorAll("link").length, 0);
}
```
