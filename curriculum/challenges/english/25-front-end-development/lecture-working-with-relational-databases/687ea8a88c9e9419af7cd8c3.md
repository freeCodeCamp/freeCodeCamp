# --description--

Let's see some of the fundamental commands that you can use to insert and view data in SQL.

First of all, to view data, you need to insert it. So we'll start with insertions.

The examples that we will cover in this lecture will be based on this table of dog records:

```sql
CREATE TABLE dogs(
  id SERIAL,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  age INTEGER
);
```

The table will store the names and ages of various dogs.

If we assume that we are working with PostgreSQL, we can use the `SERIAL` data type for the `id`. Since `id` was created using `SERIAL`, its value will be an `INTEGER`, starting from `1`, and incremented automatically when a new record is inserted. So you will not need to pass a value for it when you insert a record.

Let's start by inserting records to our `dogs` table with the `INSERT INTO` statement. There are many ways to do this. The first one would be inserting a single row and specifying the columns of the values that will be inserted.

You write `INSERT INTO`, followed by the name of the table (in this case, `dogs`), then the columns within parentheses, then `VALUES`, and their corresponding values within parentheses.

This is an example, we're inserting a dog record with the `name` of `'Gino'`, whose `age` is `3`, remember that the `id` will be assigned automatically:

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs (name, age)
VALUES ('Gino', 3);
```

This is usually the safest option because you specify the columns explicitly, so the values will be assigned to those columns in order.

Notice that `'Gino'` needs to be in single quotes because it is a `VARCHAR` type.

Another alternative is to insert the record without specifying the columns, like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs
VALUES ('Gino', 3);
```

This is valid too, but it's more prone to errors because the values are assigned to the columns based on their order.

You can also insert multiple records in the same SQL command by separating them with a comma.

Here, we are inserting two dog records, one for `'Gino'` and another one for `'Nora'`.

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs (name, age)
VALUES
  ('Gino', 3),
  ('Nora', 2);
```

And just like you can insert records, you can query information from the database. In the context of databases, a query is a request for data.

In SQL, the `SELECT` statement is used for querying data from one or more tables. You can customize the query to get the exact information that you need.

If you need to query all the information from the `dogs` table, you just need to write `SELECT`, followed by an asterisk (`*`), then `FROM`, and the name of the table, `dogs`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dogs;
```

In this command, the asterisk is a wildcard character that represents "all columns."

You will get all the data of all the records in the table:

```sql
 id | name | age 
----+------+-----
  1 | Gino |   3
  2 | Nora |   2
```

To query specific columns, you can write the names of those columns in the command, right after `SELECT`, separated by a comma. In this example, we query the `name` and `age` columns of the `dogs` table:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM dogs;
```

The result will only include the `name` and `age` columns:

```sql
 name | age 
------+-----
 Gino |   3
 Nora |   2
```

Sometimes, you might need to query data based on a specific condition. For example, to get all dogs who are less than 3 years old you can use the `WHERE` keyword and the less than (`<`) comparison operator:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE age < 3;
```

The result will only include dogs whose age is less than 3:

```sql
 id | name | age 
----+------+-----
  2 | Nora |   2
```

If you are just trying to find the `age` of `'Gino'`, you can you can use the equals (`=`) comparison operator:

```sql
SELECT age
FROM dogs
WHERE name = 'Gino';
```

And here's the result:

```sql
 age 
-----
  3
```

These are common and simple ways to insert and view data in SQL, but there are many different options that you can choose from and some of them are more advanced. You'll learn about them in coming lectures.

Given the following query:

```bash
SELECT price FROM products WHERE category = 'Laptops';

What is the main purpose of the `WHERE category = 'Laptops'` clause?

## --answers--

To specify that only the price column should be displayed.
