# --description--

To define a table in SQL, you need to specify the data type of each column.

Remember that this is the basic syntax for creating a table in SQL. Each column has its own data type.

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
  column1 data_type column_constraint,
  column2 data_type column_constraint,
  column3 data_type column_constraint,
  ... etc
);
```

As a developer, your goal is to choose these data types as accurately as possible.

There are six popular categories of data types in SQL:

- Numeric, such as `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, `SERIAL`, and `DECIMAL`.
- Date and time, such as `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, and `TIME`.
- Character and string. These include `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, and `TEXT`.
- Unicode, including `NTEXT`, and `NVARCHAR`. These are used to make sure that text will be stored and retrieved correctly, regardless of the characters' origin.
- Binary, used to store non-textual data, like images, audio, and video files.
- And other miscellaneous data types, such as `XML` and `TABLE`.

In this lecture video, we'll cover some of the most widely used ones with PostgreSQL. Data types will vary across database management systems, but they are generally pretty similar. So you'll need to check the full list in the documentation.

We'll start with numeric values.

First, we have the `INTEGER` data type:

```sql
units_sold INTEGER
```

In this example, we assign this data type to a `units_sold` column.

`INTEGER` types consume 4 bytes in the database and can range in value from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. The official PostgreSQL documentation describes it as the "typical choice for `INTEGER`."

We also have `SMALLINT` and `BIGINT`, which are basically the same as `INTEGER` except have a smaller and bigger range of numbers, respectively, due to how much size they are allotted in the database.

A useful feature available in PostgreSQL is to create a column using the `SERIAL` keyword. Here, an `id` column is created using `SERIAL`:

```sql
id SERIAL
```

While it's not a true data type, it's very helpful for creating unique identifier columns because the column will have an `INTEGER` type, will not allow `NULL` values, and automatically increment when rows are added.

For example, the first row will automatically have an `id` of `1`, the second row will have an `id` of `2`, and so on, creating a unique ID for each record.

In MySQL, the equivalent of `SERIAL` would be the `AUTO_INCREMENT` attribute, used to generate sequential integers automatically:

```sql
id INT AUTO_INCREMENT
```

You can see that different database management systems may have different ways of achieving exactly the same functionality in your database.

These are the most commonly used numeric data types, but sometimes, you may need to represent text or sequences of characters.

For this, you have the `VARCHAR` data type. This data type is used for a variable string length. You can set the maximum character length within parentheses:

```sql
name VARCHAR(50)
```

In this example, we define a `name` column, where the values can be up to 50 characters long.

This data type sets a maximum length for the strings, but if you need to store strings of any length, you can use `TEXT` instead:

```sql
name TEXT
```

In addition to numbers and strings, it's also common to store dates and times.

For example, if you create a table to store events, you may need to store the date of each event in a specific format. For this, you have the `DATE` data type:

```sql
event_date DATE
```

To store time, you can also use the `TIME` data type. For example, you may store the time when an event starts:

```sql
start_time TIME
```

The `TIMESTAMP` data type combines both of them. It includes both the date and time. It may also include the time zone if you write `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`:

```sql
event_timestamp TIMESTAMP
```

```sql
event_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
```

And finally, if you need to store a boolean value, `TRUE` or `FALSE`, you can use the `BOOLEAN` data type:

```sql
is_active BOOLEAN
```

Now you know some of the most common data types in SQL, but there are many more. You can check the documentation of your database management system to find more information about the data types that you can use.
