# --description--

Let's learn about relational and non-relational databases.

A relational database is a collection of data organized into tables. These tables are made of rows and columns. Rows represent individual records.

For example, if you're storing user data, each row would represent a specific user. Columns represent the attributes or fields that describe each record. The table could include columns for the most important user information, including name and national ID number.

One of the key characteristics of relational databases is that they allow us to connect different pieces of information by linking tables through common attributes, making it easier to see how they relate to each other.

Relational databases require a schema. The schema defines the structure and organization of the database, including its tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints.

All tables in a relational database have a primary key, which is a unique identifier for each row. Primary keys are essential for creating relationships between tables through foreign keys.

You'll learn more about primary keys, foreign keys, and how they work in the coming lectures. For now, you should know that they are essential for linking records in different tables.

For example, let's say that you're creating a database for an organization that runs a wildlife conservation center for critically endangered animals.

One of the tables could store general information about the animals, you might call it `animals`. Each row could represent an animal, while each column could represent an attribute of that animal, like species, size, weight, age, and other unique characteristics.

You should assign a unique ID to each animal to identify it in the database. To do this, you would usually add an `ID` column. This would be the primary key of the table because it's unique for each animal. The ID of each animal could be used to link its record in this table to related records in other tables.

Another potential table could be a `species` table, where you would store information about all the species in the center, such as their habitat and conservation status.

You could also create a table to store the veterinary records of the animals. This way, the center can track their health, treatments, and medications.

Once you have this general schema, you could link these tables to the main table, where you store the general information about the animals.

This way, you don't have to keep all the information about an animal in the same table. You can store the data in different tables and link them as necessary. By creating these relationships, you can get the specific data you need with a single query.

A query is a request for specific data from the database. Examples of queries that you could make in the context of our example would be finding all animals that need a veterinary checkup, finding the most critically endangered species in the center, finding the number of animals who were born in captivity, and more. You can customize the queries to fit your needs.

Our example was related to wildlife conservation but relational databases have a wide range of applications in many different areas, including healthcare, construction, management, business, gaming, education, government, e-commerce, social media, and more.

They offer several advantages, including scalability. They can handle large datasets, so they're perfect for complex, real-world applications. They also enforce data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and data types, which ensures that the data will be consistent and accurate.

In addition to relational databases, you can work with non-relational databases. The main difference between relational and non-relational databases is how the data is stored.

Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are more flexible. They store data in individual files that are not connected. Their data model is more flexible too.

While some non-relational databases may have a basic schema or data model, it is often less rigid than the schema defined in relational databases. You can add, modify, or remove data fields if necessary.

The decision to use a relational or non-relational database depends on various factors, including the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the application. You should evaluate the tradeoffs between these two approaches to choose the best one for your application.
