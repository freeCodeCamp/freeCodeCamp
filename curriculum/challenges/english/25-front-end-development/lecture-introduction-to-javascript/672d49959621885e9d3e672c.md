How do `let` and `const` differ when is comes to variable declaration, assignment, and reassignment?

When working with JavaScript, you'll often declare variables to store data that you plan to use throughout your program.

In modern JavaScript, `let` and `const` are the preferred ways to declare variables, but they differ in how they handle value assignment and reassignment.

In this lecture, we'll explore how `let` and `const` differ in variable declaration, assignment, and reassignment.

The `let` keyword allows you to declare variables that can be updated or reassigned later. You can think of `let` as a flexible container – once you've stored a value in it, you can change that value as needed throughout your program.

Here's an example of declaring and assigning a variable with `let`:

```js
let score = 10;
```

In this case, the variable `score` is declared and assigned the value `10`. If you want to update the value later, you can easily do that:

```js
score = 20;
```

Now, `score` holds the value `20`. This makes `let` particularly useful when you know the value of a variable will change as your program runs.

On the other hand, `const` is used to declare variables that are constant. Once you assign a value to a variable declared with `const`, you cannot reassign it.

This makes `const` ideal for values that you don't want to change accidentally during the execution of your program.

Here's an example of declaring and assigning a variable with `const`:

```js
const maxScore = 100;
```

Once `maxScore` is assigned the value `100`, it cannot be changed:

```js
maxScore = 200; // This will result in an error
```

Trying to reassign a value to a `const` variable will throw an error in your JavaScript console, as `const` variables are immutable once they are assigned.

You can declare a `let` variable without immediately assigning it a value, and you can assign it a value later:

```js
let age;
age = 25;
```

Variables declared with `const` must be assigned a value at the time of declaration. If you try to declare a `const` variable without assigning it a value, you will get an error:

```js
const age; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration
```

You should use `let` when you need to declare variables that will be reassigned later. For example, tracking a changing score or updating a value over time in your program.

Use `const` when you want to declare variables that should remain constant, like configuration values or settings that shouldn't be changed accidentally.

You can also use the `var` keyword, but it's not as recommended anymore. The `var` is kind of like `let`, except it has a wider scope, which is more likely to cause problems in your program.

## --text--

What happens if you try to reassign a value to a variable declared with `const`?

## --answers--

The value will change without issue.

### --feedback--

Think about what `const` stands for.

---

The original value will be updated, but a warning will be issued.

### --feedback--

Think about what `const` stands for.

---

An error will be thrown because `const` variables cannot be reassigned.

---

The new value will be ignored, and the original value will stay the same.

### --feedback--

Think about what `const` stands for.

## --text--

Can you declare a `const` variable without assigning it a value?

## --answers--

Yes, but you must assign a value later.

### --feedback--

Think about the immutability of `const`.

---

No, `const` variables must be initialized at the time of declaration.

---

Yes, but you can only assign a number as the initial value.

### --feedback--

Think about the immutability of `const`.

---

No, `const` variables must be declared and reassigned in the same line.

### --feedback--

Think about the immutability of `const`.
