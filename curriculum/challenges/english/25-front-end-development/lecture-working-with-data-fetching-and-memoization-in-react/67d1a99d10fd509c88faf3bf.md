How does data fetching work in React?

React apps often rely on external APIs and databases for dynamic content.

To access the data from those APIs and databases, you need to use some data fetching techniques.

Let’s take a look at how data fetching works in React and the different options available to you for fetching data.

React is not opinionated about how you fetch data, this means on a basic level, you can use the built-in Fetch API, which all modern browsers support.

You can also use Axios and SWR. Axios is promise-based HTTP request library built on top of the XMLHttpRequest object, and SWR is a React hook for data fetching created by the Vercel team.

Let’s start with an example. You first need to import the useState and useEffect hooks:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
```

Then you will need to create three state variables called loading, data, and error.

```js
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);
```

The loading variable will track whether the data is still being fetched. The data variable represents the data itself, and the error variable will capture any errors that might occur during the data fetching process.

Since data fetching is a side effect, it's best to use the fetch API inside of a useEffect hook.

Here's an example of that:

```js
useEffect(() => {
   fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
     .then((res) => res.json())
     .then((data) => {
       setData(data);
       setLoading(false);
     })
     .catch((err) => {
       setError(err);
       setLoading(false);
     });
 }, []);
```

This useEffect fetches the data with the Fetch API and sets all the states. 

You can make things better by using async/await instead of the .then() syntax. That means you have to have a separate function inside the useEffect because you cannot prefix useEffect with the async keyword:

```js
useEffect(() => {
   const fetchData = async () => {
     try {
       const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
       
       if (!res.ok) {
         throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
       }

       const data = await res.json();
       setData(data);
     } catch (err) {
       setError(err);
     } finally {
       setLoading(false);
     }
   };

   fetchData();
 }, []);
```

You can then go ahead and use all of those states to render the data from the API.

Here's the full code:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const FetchPosts = () => {
 const [data, setData] = useState(null);
 const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
 const [error, setError] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
   const fetchData = async () => {
     try {
       const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");
       
       if (!res.ok) {
         throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
       }

       const data = await res.json();
       setData(data);
     } catch (err) {
       setError(err);
     } finally {
       setLoading(false);
     }
   };

   fetchData();
 }, []);

 if (loading) {
   return <p>Loading...</p>;
 }

 if (error) {
   return <p>{error.message}</p>;
 }

 return (
   <ul>
     {data.map((post) => (
       <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
     ))}
   </ul>
 );
};

export default FetchPosts;
```

Here's what happens in the UI:

You can see the data and loading states at work. Here's the error state too:

Remember we talked about data fetching with Axios and SWR too. Let’s take a look at an example using Axios.

You will first need to install Axios from the command line like this:

```sh
npm i axios
```

Then you will need to import Axios like this:

```js
import axios from "axios";
```

Then you can use the same state variables from earlier and fetch data from the API using axios.get:

```js
const [data, setData] = useState(null);
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
const [error, setError] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
   const fetchData = async () => {
     try {
       const res = await axios.get(
         "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
       );
       setData(res.data);
     } catch (err) {
       setError(err);
     } finally {
       setLoading(false);
     }
   };

   fetchData();
}, []);
```

You might have noticed that there is no await res.json() line in this example. That's because Axios automatically parses JSON, so there's no need for that.

The last example we will look at is to use the useSWR hook  to fetch data.

Just like with Axios, you will need to install SWR like this:

```sh
npm install swr
```

Then you will need to import the useSWR hook into the file like this:

```js
import useSWR from "swr";
```

In comparison to the previous examples, the SWR syntax is way shorter. What you need to do is to create a fetcher function and pass it into the useSWR hook as its second parameter (the endpoint is the first parameter).

You also get to destructure both the data and error states from the useSWR hook, so you don't need the useState hook.

Here is the syntax:

```js
const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
const { data, error } = useSWR(endpoint, fetcher);
```

Note that the “fetcher“ here is only a convention, so you’re free to name the variable whatever you want.

Here's a component fetching todos from the JSON Placeholder API:

```js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());

const FetchTodos = () => {
 const { data, error } = useSWR(
   "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos",
   fetcher
 );

 if (!data) {
   return <h2>Loading...</h2>;
 }
 if (error) {
   return <h2>Error: {error.message}</h2>;
 }

 return (
   <>
     <h2>Todos</h2>
     <div>
       {data.map((todo) => (
         <h3 key={todo.id}>{todo.title}</h3>
       ))}
     </div>
   </>
 );
};

export default FetchTodos;
```

As you learned in a previous lecture on custom hooks, data fetching is a logic you can extract into a custom hook. So, if you're fetching data in multiple components and pages, it is best to create a useFetch hook.

Here's a useFetch hook that uses SWR for data fetching:

```js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());

const useFetch = (url) => {
 const { data, error } = useSWR(url, fetcher);

 return {
   data,
   loading: !data && !error,
   error,
 };
};

export default useFetch;
```

And here's how to use the useFetch hook to rewrite the first example that fetches posts from the JSON Placeholder API:

```js
import useFetch from "./useFetch";

const FetchPosts = () => {
 const { data, loading, error } = useFetch(
   "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
 );

 if (loading) {
   return <h2>Loading...</h2>;
 }

 if (error) {
   return <h2>{error.message}</h2>;
 }

 return (
   <>
     <h2>Posts</h2>
     <ul>
       {data.map((post) => (
         <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
       ))}
     </ul>
   </>
 );
};

export default FetchPosts;
```

## --text--

Why do you have to handle data fetching logic inside a `useEffect`?

## --answers--

Because data fetching should only run once.

### --feedback--

Fetching data affects things outside the component and should not block rendering.

---

Because data fetching should not be part of the rendering process.

---

Because `useEffect` executes before the component renders.

### --feedback--

Fetching data affects things outside the component and should not block rendering.

---

Because `useEffect` runs synchronously with the render cycle.

Fetching data affects things outside the component and should not block rendering.
