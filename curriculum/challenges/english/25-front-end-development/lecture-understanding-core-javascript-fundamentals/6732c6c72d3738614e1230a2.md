What are linters and formatters, and how can they help you with code consistency?

In the world of software development maintaining clean, consistent and error-free code is important. This is where linters and formatters come into play. These tools are essential for developers to ensure code quality and consistency across a projects and teams.

Let's start with linters. A linter is a static code analysis tool that flags programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. The term lint comes from a Unix utility that examines C language source code. 

Today linters exist for most programming languages including JavaScript. Linters help in several ways. First they catch potential errors before runtime. For example, a linter might flag the use of undefined variable or a function being called with the wrong number of arguments. They also enforce coding standards and best practices. This might include rules about indentation, the use of semicolons, or the maximum allowed line length. Lastly, they help maintain consistency across a codebase especially when multiple developers are working on the same project.

A popular linter for JavaScript is ESLint. Here is a simple example of what ESLint might flag:

```js
function doSomething(x) {
  return x + z
}
```

In this code variable `z` is not declared, so ESLint would flag the error `z` is not defined. Also, the last statement is missing a semicolon which ESLint might also flag in the code editor.

Formatters on the other hand are tools that automatically format your code to adhere to a specific style guide. While linters can often autofix some issues, formatters are specifically designed to rewrite your code to match a predetermined style. 

Formatters ensure a consistent code style across an entire project or team regardless of individual developer preferences. They also save time and mental energy that would otherwise be spent on manual formatting. Lastly, they can make code reviews more efficient by eliminating discussions about code style. 

A popular formatter for JavaScript is Prettier. Here is an example of how Prettier might format code. Here's a before formatting:

```js
function longFunction(
  argument1, 
  argument2,
  argument3
) {return argument1 + argument2 + argument3;}
```

And then after the prettier formatting:

```js
function longFunction(argument1, argument2, argument3) {
  return argument1 + argument2 + argument3;
}
```

Both linters and formatters can be integrated into your development workflow in various ways. They can be included in your build process or added as plugins to your text editor or IDE providing real-time feedback as you code. Using linters and formatters together can significantly improve code quality and consistency. For example, you might use ESLint to catch potential errors and enforce certain coding practices, and then use Prettier to handle all formatting tasks. 

Many developement teams set up these tools as part of their project configuration often with pre-commit hooks that run the linter and formatter before allowing code to be committed. This ensures that all code in the repository meets the teams standards for quality and style.

In summary, linters and formatters are powerful tools that help maintain code quality, catch potential errors early, and ensure consistency across codebases. By automating this aspects of code review they allow developers to focus more on solving problems and less on debating code style.
