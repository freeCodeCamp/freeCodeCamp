What is the `Number()` constructor and how does it work for type coercion?

The `Number()` constructor is used to create a number object. The number object contains a few helpful properties and methods like the `isNaN` and the `toFix` method. Here's an example using the `Number()` constructor with the `new` keyword:

```js
const myNum = new Number("34");
console.log(typeof myNum); // "object" 
```

In this example we pass in a string literal to the `Number()` constructor and the return type is of type `object` instead of a `string`. 

When the `Number()` constructor is called as a function without the `new` keyword, then the return value will be the primitive number type. Most of the time you will be using the `Number()` constructor to convert other data types to the number data type. Here's an example of converting a string to a number:

```js
const myNum = Number("100");
console.log(myNum); // 100

console.log(typeof myNum); // number
```

This is helpful when you are getting input from the user and you need to convert that string input to a number so you can perform mathematical calculations. 

If you try to call the `Number()` constructor through an empty string then the result will be the number `0`: 

```js
const num = Number("");
console.log(num); // 0
```

This is because JavaScript will try to parse the string and since it doesn't contain any digits, the result will be zero.

If you try to pass in a string with random characters then the result will be `NaN` or "Not a Number". 

```js
const num = Number("random");
console.log(num); // NaN
```

When working with booleans, `true` returns `1` because `true` gets converted to one and `false` returns `0` because `false` is converted to zero. 

```js
const boolTrue = Number(true);
const boolFalse = Number(false);

console.log(boolTrue); // 1
console.log(boolFalse); // 0
```

If you pass in `null`, the result will be `0` and if you pass `undefined`, the result will be `NaN`. 

```js
const undefinedNum = Number(undefined);
const nullNum = Number(null);

console.log(undefinedNum); // NaN
console.log(nullNum); // 0
```

When working with arrays there are a few things to consider, an empty array will return `0`, an array with a single number will return that number, an array with multiple numbers returns `NaN`, and an array with strings will return `undefined`. 

```js
const obj1 = Number({});
const obj2 = Number({2: 2});
const obj3 = Number({key: "val"});
const obj4 = Number({key: true});

console.log(obj1); // NaN
console.log(obj2); // NaN
console.log(obj3); // NaN
console.log(obj4); // NaN
```

When working with objects, the result is always `NaN`.

In conclusion, you'll mostly use the `Number()` constructor for type conversion more than creating a number or a number object.

Which of these is one of the correct ways JavaScript handles arrays when converting them to numbers using the `Number` constructor?

## --answers--

An empty array returns `NaN`.

### --feedback--

Think about how different array structures might behave during conversion.

---
