## Algorithms and Big O Notation

- **Algorithms**: A set of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem or carrying out a task. Algorithms must finish in a finite number of steps and each step must be precise and unambiguous.

- **Big O Notation**: Describes the worst-case performance, or growth rate, of an algorithm as the input size increases. It focuses on how resource usage grows with input size, ignoring constant factors and lower-order terms.

### Common Time Complexities

- **O(1) - Constant Time**: Algorithm takes the same amount of time regardless of input size.

```python
def check_even_or_odd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return 'Even'
    else:
        return 'Odd'
```

- **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**: Time increases slowly as input grows. Common in algorithms that repeatedly reduce problem size by a fraction (like Binary Search).

- **O(n) - Linear Time**: Running time increases proportionally to input size.

```python
for grade in grades:
    print(grade)
```

- **O(n log n) - Log-Linear Time**: Common time complexity of efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

- **O(n²) - Quadratic Time**: Running time increases quadratically. Often seen in nested loops.

```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        print("Hello, World!")
```

### Space Complexity

- **O(1) - Constant Space**: Algorithm uses same amount of memory regardless of input size.
- **O(n) - Linear Space**: Memory usage grows proportionally with input size.
- **O(n²) - Quadratic Space**: Memory usage grows quadratically with input size.

## Problem-Solving Techniques

- **Understanding the Problem**: Read the problem statement multiple times. Identify the input, expected output, and how to transform input to output.

- **Pseudocode**: High-level description of algorithm logic that is language-independent. Uses common written language mixed with programming constructs like `IF`, `ELSE`, `FOR`, `WHILE`.

```md
GET original_string
SET reversed_string = ""
FOR EACH character IN original_string:
  ADD character TO THE BEGINNING OF reversed_string
DISPLAY reversed_string
```

- **Edge Cases**: Specific, valid inputs that occur at the boundaries of what an algorithm should handle. Always consider and test edge cases.

## Arrays

- **Static Arrays**: Have a fixed size determined at initialization. Elements stored in adjacent memory locations. Size cannot be changed during program execution.

- **Dynamic Arrays**: Can grow or shrink automatically during program execution. Handle resizing through automatic copying to larger arrays when needed.

### Python Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

```python
numbers = [3, 4, 5, 6]

# Access elements
numbers[0]  # 3

# Update elements
numbers[2] = 16

# Add elements
numbers.append(7)
numbers.insert(3, 15)  # Insert at specific index

# Remove elements
numbers.pop(2)  # Remove at specific index
numbers.pop()   # Remove last element
```

### Time Complexities for Dynamic Arrays

- **Access**: O(1)
- **Insert at end**: O(1) average, O(n) when resizing needed
- **Insert in middle**: O(n)
- **Delete**: O(n) for middle, O(1) for end

## Stacks

- **Stacks**: Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Elements added and removed from the top only.

- **Push Operation**: Adding an element to the top of the stack. Time complexity: O(1).

- **Pop Operation**: Removing an element from the top of the stack. Time complexity: O(1).

```python
# Using Python list as stack
stack = []

# Push operations
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.append(3)

# Pop operations
top_element = stack.pop()  # Returns 3
```

## Queues

- **Queues**: First-In, First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Elements added to the back and removed from the front.

- **Enqueue Operation**: Adding an element to the back of the queue. Time complexity: O(1).

- **Dequeue Operation**: Removing an element from the front of the queue. Time complexity: O(1).

```python
from collections import deque

# Using deque for efficient queue operations
queue = deque()

# Enqueue operations
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.append(3)

# Dequeue operations
first_element = queue.popleft()  # Returns 1
```

## Linked Lists

- **Linked Lists**: Linear data structure where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. Nodes are connected like a chain.

### Singly Linked Lists

- **Structure**: Each node has data and one reference to the next node.
- **Traversal**: Can only move forward from head to tail.
- **Head Node**: First node in the list, usually the only directly accessible node.
- **Tail Node**: Last node in the list, points to `None`.

### Operations and Time Complexities

- **Insert at beginning**: O(1)
- **Insert at end**: O(n) - must traverse to end
- **Insert in middle**: O(n) - must traverse to position
- **Delete from beginning**: O(1)
- **Delete from end**: O(n) - must traverse to find previous node
- **Delete from middle**: O(n) - must traverse to find node

### Doubly Linked Lists

- **Structure**: Each node has data and two references: next node and previous node.
- **Traversal**: Can move in both directions.
- **Memory**: Requires more memory than singly linked lists due to extra reference.

## Hash Maps and Sets

### Maps and Hash Maps

- **Map (Abstract Data Type)**: Manages collections of key-value pairs. Every key must be unique, but values can be repeated.

- **Hash Map**: Concrete implementation of map ADT using hashing technique. Uses hash function to generate hash values for keys, which determine storage location in underlying array.

### Python Dictionaries (Hash Maps)

```python
# Creating dictionaries
my_dictionary = {
    "A": 1,
    "B": 2, 
    "C": 3
}

# Alternative creation
my_dictionary = dict(A=1, B=2, C=3)

# Access and modify
value = my_dictionary["A"]  # 1
my_dictionary["A"] = 4      # Update value
del my_dictionary["A"]      # Remove key-value pair

# Check membership
"C" in my_dictionary

# Get keys, values, items
my_dictionary.keys()
my_dictionary.values()
my_dictionary.items()
```

### Time Complexities for Hash Maps

- **Average case**: O(1) for insert, get, delete
- **Worst case**: O(n) when many hash collisions occur

### Sets

- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique elements. No duplicates allowed, no specific order maintained.

- **Immutable Elements Only**: Sets can only contain immutable data types (numbers, strings, tuples) because hash values must remain constant.

```python
# Creating sets
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
empty_set = set()  # Must use set(), not {}

# Add and remove elements
numbers.add(5)
numbers.remove(4)      # Raises KeyError if not found
numbers.discard(4)     # No error if not found

# Set operations
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_b = {2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
set_a.union(set_b)                    # or set_a | set_b
set_a.intersection(set_b)             # or set_a & set_b
set_a.difference(set_b)               # or set_a - set_b
set_a.symmetric_difference(set_b)     # or set_a ^ set_b

# Subset and superset checks
set_a.issubset(set_b)
set_a.issuperset(set_b)
set_a.isdisjoint(set_b)

# Membership testing
5 in numbers
```

### Time Complexities for Sets

- **Average case**: O(1) for add, remove, membership testing
- **Worst case**: O(n) due to hash collisions

## Hash Collisions

- **Hash Collision**: Occurs when two different keys produce the same hash value.

- **Collision Resolution Strategies**:
  - **Chaining**: Each array index points to a linked list storing all elements with same hash value
  - **Open Addressing**: Search for next available index using predefined sequence

## When to Use Each Data Structure

- **Lists**: When you need ordered, indexed access and don't know size in advance
- **Stacks**: For LIFO operations (undo functionality, expression evaluation, backtracking)
- **Queues**: For FIFO operations (task scheduling, breadth-first search)
- **Linked Lists**: When frequent insertion/deletion at beginning, unknown size, no random access needed
- **Hash Maps**: For fast key-value lookups, counting occurrences, caching
- **Sets**: For uniqueness checking, mathematical set operations, removing duplicates
