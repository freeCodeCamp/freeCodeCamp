# --description--

In this lab, you will create two different stories using a sentence template. You will use variables to store different parts of the story and then output the stories to the console.

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should declare the following variables using `let`:
   
    - `adjective`
    - `noun`
    - `verb`
    - `place`
    - `adjective2`
    - `noun2`

1. You should assign the above variables some string values of your choice.

1. You should declare a `firstStory` variable.
   
1. You should use the following story template to create the first story and assign it to the `firstStory` variable: `"Once upon a time, there was a(n) [adjective] [noun] who loved to eat [noun2]. The [noun] lived in a [place] and had [adjective2] nostrils that blew fire when it was [verb]."`;

1. You should output your first story to the console using the message `"First story: [firstStory]"`.

1. You should assign new values to your `adjective`, `noun`, `verb`, `place`, `adjective2`, and `noun2` variables.

1. You should declare a `secondStory` variable.

1. Create another story using the same template and assign it to the `secondStory` variable.

1. You should output your second story to the console using the message `"Second story: [secondStory]"`.


# --hints--

You should declare an `adjective` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(adjective);
```

You should declare a `noun` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(noun);
```

You should declare a `verb` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(verb);
```

You should declare a `place` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(place);
```

You should declare an `adjective2` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(adjective2);
```

You should declare a `noun2` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(noun2);
```

You should assign a string value to the `adjective` variable.

```js
assert.isString(adjective);
```

You should assign a string value to the `noun` variable.

```js
assert.isString(noun);
```

You should assign a string value to the `verb` variable.

```js
assert.isString(verb);
```

You should assign a string value to the `place` variable.

```js
assert.isString(place);
```

You should assign a string value to the `adjective2` variable.

```js
assert.isString(adjective2);
```

You should assign a string value to the `noun2` variable.

```js
assert.isString(noun2);
```

You should declare a `firstStory` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(firstStory);
```

You should use the correct story format for the first story: `"Once upon a time, there was a(n) [adjective] [noun] who loved to eat [noun2]. The [noun] lived in a [place] and had [adjective2] nostrils that blew fire when it was [verb]."`. Pay attention to spaces.

```js
const _initialValues = {}
for (const name of ['adjective', 'noun', 'noun2', 'place', 'verb', 'adjective2']) {
    const match = code.match(new RegExp(String.raw`${name}\s*=\s*('|"|${'`'})(?<${name}>.*)\1;?\s*`));
    _initialValues[name] = match ? match.groups[name] : null;
}

const expected = `Once upon a time, there was a(n) ${_initialValues['adjective']} ${_initialValues['noun']} who loved to eat ${_initialValues['noun2']}. The ${_initialValues['noun']} lived in a ${_initialValues['place']} and had ${_initialValues['adjective2']} nostrils that blew fire when it was ${_initialValues['verb']}.`;

assert.strictEqual(firstStory, expected);
```

You should log your first story using the message `"First story: [firstStory]"`.

```js
const condition1 = /console\.log\(\s*["']First\s+story:\s+["']\s*\+\s*firstStory\s*\);?/gm.test(code);
const condition2 = /console\.log\(\s*`First\s+story:\s+\$\{firstStory\}`\s*\);?/gm.test(code);
assert.isTrue(condition1 || condition2);
```

You should declare a `secondStory` variable.

```js
assert.isNotNull(secondStory);
```

You should reassign the `adjective` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/adjective\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `noun` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/noun\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `verb` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/verb\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `place` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/place\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `adjective2` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/adjective2\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should reassign the `noun2` variable for the second story.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/noun2\s*=\s*/g), 2);
```

You should use the correct story format for the second story: `"Once upon a time, there was a(n) [adjective] [noun] who loved to eat [noun2]. The [noun] lived in a [place] and had [adjective2] nostrils that blew fire when it was [verb]."`. Pay attention to spaces.

```js
const expected = `Once upon a time, there was a(n) ${adjective} ${noun} who loved to eat ${noun2}. The ${noun} lived in a ${place} and had ${adjective2} nostrils that blew fire when it was ${verb}.`;
assert.strictEqual(secondStory, expected);
```

You should log your second story using the format `"Second story: [secondStory]"`.

```js
const condition1 = /console\.log\(\s*["']Second\s+story:\s+["']\s*\+\s*secondStory\s*\);?/gm.test(code);
const condition2 = /console\.log\(\s*`Second\s+story:\s+\$\{secondStory\}`\s*\);?/gm.test(code);
assert.isTrue(condition1 || condition2);
```

The `firstStory` should not be the same as the `secondStory`.

```js
assert.notEqual(firstStory, secondStory);
```
