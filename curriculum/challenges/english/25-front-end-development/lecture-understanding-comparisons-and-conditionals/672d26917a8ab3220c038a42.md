How do comparisons work with `null` and `undefined` data types?

In JavaScript, `null` and `undefined` are two distinct data types that represent the absence of a value, but they behave differently in comparisons. Understanding how these types interact in various comparison scenarios is crucial for writing robust and bug-free code.

Let's start with the `undefined` type. A variable is `undefined` when it has been declared but hasn't been assigned a value. It's the default value of uninitialized variables and function parameters that weren't provided an argument.

The `null` type, on the other hand, is an assignment value that represents a deliberate non-value. It's often used to indicate that a variable intentionally has no value.

When comparing `null` and `undefined` using the equality operator (`==`), JavaScript performs type coercion. This means it tries to convert the operands to the same type before making the comparison. In this case, `null` and `undefined` are considered equal:

```js
console.log(null == undefined); // true
```

However, when using the strict equality operator (`===`), which checks both value and type without performing type coercion, `null` and `undefined` are not equal:

```js
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

This difference is important to keep in mind when writing conditional statements or performing equality checks in your code. When comparing `null` or `undefined` with other values using the equality operator (`==`), the behavior can be unexpected. For example:

```js
console.log(null == 0);  // false
console.log(null == ''); // false
console.log(undefined == 0); // false
console.log(undefined == ''); // false
```

These comparisons return `false` because `null` and `undefined` are only equal to each other (and themselves) when using the equality operator. The behavior of `null` in other comparisons is particularly tricky:

```js
console.log(null > 0);  // false
console.log(null == 0); // false
console.log(null >= 0); // true
```

`undefined`, on the other hand, always converts to `NaN` in numeric contexts, which makes all numeric comparisons with `undefined` return `false`:

```js
console.log(undefined > 0);  // false
console.log(undefined < 0);  // false
console.log(undefined == 0); // false
```

Given these nuances, it's generally recommended to use the strict equality operator when comparing values, especially when dealing with `null` and `undefined`. This approach helps avoid unexpected type coercion and makes your code's behavior more predictable.

In summary, while `null` and `undefined` are both used to represent the absence of a value, they behave differently in comparisons. Understanding these differences is key to writing clear and error-free JavaScript code.
