How can you effectively work with your keyboard, mouse, and other pointing devices?

Many of you have been used to working with your keyboard and mouse for years on end for a variety of activities like gaming, performing tasks for work, or surfing the web.

But prolonged misuse of these devices can lead to serious health problems down the road.

In this lecture video, we will cover ways to work with your computer’s keyboard and mouse in healthy ways.

The first tip is to be mindful of the mouse grip. When working on serious tasks for work or during intense gaming moments, you may tend to grip the mouse too hard. However, this can lead to serious hand and wrist issues. To prevent this, you want to make sure to hold the mouse gently and keep your fingers nice and relaxed.

The second tip is to consider using an ergonomic keyboard and mouse. These tools are designed to reduce wrist strain by keeping your hands in a more natural position.

While prices for these devices can vary and may be a costly purchase for your current budget, they can be a good investment in your overall long-term health. So, you might consider starting to research an ergonomic keyboard and mouse to use.

Another tip is to keep your mouse the same height as your keyboard. You don't want to have to reach up or down to use the mouse, as this can strain your wrist and arm muscles over time.

You also want to be mindful of your overall posture when sitting at the computer for hours on end. Being slouched over your computer and putting your wrist in an unnatural position at the keyboard will lead to long-term health issues. So, you want to make sure to sit up straight when working at your computer and maintain a healthy and natural wrist position.

The last tip would be to use keyboard shortcuts whenever possible to help minimize typing. There are dozens of shortcuts available for tasks such as navigating the web, navigating around your operating system, working within a code editor, and more. So, it’s best to research some of these keyboard shortcuts and and start incorporating them into your daily computer usage.

As you continue using your mouse and keyboard for upcoming coding projects and other activities, remember to keep these health tips in mind.
