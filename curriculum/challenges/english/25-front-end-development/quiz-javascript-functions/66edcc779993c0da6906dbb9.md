#### --text--

What is the syntax for an arrow function?

#### --distractors--

`myFunction: function() {}`

---

`function myFunction() {}`

---

`const myFunction = function() {};`

#### --answer--

#### --answer--

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

```js
function greet(name) { 
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}
