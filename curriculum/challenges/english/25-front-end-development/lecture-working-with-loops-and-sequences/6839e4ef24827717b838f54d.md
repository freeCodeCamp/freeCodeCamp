# --description--

Throughout the previous lectures, you have been used to defining functions by using the `def` keyword like this:

```py
def square(num):
    return num ** 2

print(square(4)) # 16
```

But when it comes to working with high order functions like `map()` and `filter()`, you can use an anonymous inline function. This is where lambda functions come in.

Here's what the `square()` function looks like when refactored into a lambda function:

```py
lambda num: num ** 2
```

As mentioned earlier, lambda functions are anonymous, so this function no longer has the name `square` associated with it. Lambda functions are great when you need to use them in higher order functions like this:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # [2, 4]
```

In this example, we have a list of numbers and want to create a new list of even numbers. So we pass in a lambda function as one of the arguments to the `filter()` function to get a new list containing the numbers `2` and `4`.

When working with lambda functions it is important to be aware of best practices. For example, it is not a good practice to assign a lambda function to a variable like this:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

square = lambda x: x ** 2
squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print(squared_numbers) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

This defeats the purpose of using anonymous functions. In this case, you should use a regular function, like this:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def square(num):
    return num ** 2

squared_numbers = list(map(square, numbers))
print(squared_numbers) # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Also, you should avoid creating lambda functions that are difficult to read or unnecessarily complicated, like this:

```py
result = (lambda x: (x**2 + 2*x - 1) if x > 0 else (x**3 - x + 4))(3)
print(result)  # 14
```

While this function runs fine and produces the correct result of `14`, it is not easy to read or look at. In this case, it would be better to create a separate function with an `if/else` statement, and then call that function:

```py
def calculate_expression(x):
    if x > 0:
        return x**2 + 2*x - 1
    else:
        return x**3 - x + 4

print(calculate_expression(3))  # 14
```

Both regular functions and lambda functions have their use cases in Python programs. If you are dealing with a single inline expressions, then you might consider using a lambda function. Otherwise, using a regular function would be the way to go.
