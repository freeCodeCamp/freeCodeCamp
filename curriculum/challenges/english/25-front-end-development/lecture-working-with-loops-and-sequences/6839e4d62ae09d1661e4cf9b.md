# --description--

For the past few lectures, you have been getting comfortable working with loops like this:

```py
even_numbers = []

for num in range(21):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(num)

print(even_numbers)
```

This example creates a new empty list called `even_numbers` and loops through a sequence of numbers between `0` and `20`. Inside the loop, there's a condition that checks if the current number has a remainder of `0` when divided by `2`. This is used to determine if the number is even. If the condition is `True`, then the current `num` is appended at the end of the `even_numbers` list. Finally, we print the `even_numbers` list to the console.

While this code works, there is a more concise way to write this that uses list comprehension instead. List comprehension allows you to create a new list in a single line by combining a loop and condition directly within square brackets or by passing them to the `list()` function. This makes the code shorter and often easier to read.

Here is the refactored example from earlier using square brackets:

```py
even_numbers = [num for num in range(21) if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)
```

And here it is using the `list()` function:

```py
even_numbers = list(num for num in range(21) if num % 2 == 0)
print(even_numbers)
```

In this refactored example, the `even_numbers` list is created using a single line of code. The list comprehension loops through numbers from `0` to `20`, and includes only those that are divisible by `2`. This approach is more compact and eliminates the need for a separate loop and conditional block.

Let's take a look at another example so we can better understand how list comprehension works:

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = [(num, 'Even') if num % 2 == 0 else (num, 'Odd') for num in numbers]
print(result)
```

In this example, we have a list of numbers and want to create a new list of tuples indicating which numbers are even or odd. In the first part of the list comprehension, we use an `if` statement to check if the number is evenly divisible by `2`. If so, then the result is a tuple of that number followed by the word `Even`. Otherwise, the result is a tuple with the number followed by the word `Odd`.

Here is what the result looks like printed in the console:

```py
[(1, 'Odd'), (2, 'Even'), (3, 'Odd'), (4, 'Even'), (5, 'Odd')]
```

Another useful function to use with list comprehension is `filter()`. Here is an example of creating a new list of just words longer than four characters:

```py
words = ['tree', 'sky', 'mountain', 'river', 'cloud', 'sun']

def is_long_word(word):
    return len(word) > 4

long_words = list(filter(is_long_word, words))
print(long_words) # ['mountain', 'river', 'cloud']
```

The `filter()` function is used to select elements from an iterable that meet a specific condition. The `filter()` function accepts a function and an iterable for its arguments. In this example, we are passing in an `is_long_word` function into the `filter()` function to check if the current word count is greater than `4`. All words that have a character count greater than `4` are added into a new list and assigned to the `long_words` variable.

Aside from the `filter()` function, there are a few more functions that are helpful when working with lists. Another function to be aware of is the `map()` function, which takes an iterable and applies a function to each of its elements. Here is an example of using the `map()` function to convert a list of temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit:

```py
celsius = [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]

def to_fahrenheit(temp):
    return (temp * 9/5) + 32

fahrenheit = list(map(to_fahrenheit, celsius))
print(fahrenheit) # [32.0, 50.0, 68.0, 86.0, 104.0]
```

Just like the `filter()` function, `map()` accepts a function and an iterable for its arguments. The `to_fahrenheit` function takes a temperature and converts it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The last function we will look at is the `sum()` function. This function is used to get the sum from an iterable like a list or tuple. Here is an example of using the `sum()` function:

```py
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total) # Result: 50
```

You can also pass in an optional `start` argument which sets the initial value for the summation. Here is an updated example using the `start` argument as a positional argument:

```py
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
total = sum(numbers, 10) # positional argument
print(total) # 60
```

You can also choose to use the `start` argument as a keyword argument like this instead:

```py
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
total = sum(numbers, start=10) # keyword argument
print(total) # 60
```

Both versions will produce the same result, but the keyword argument is a little more explicit.

List comprehension as well as other functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sum()` might seem a little confusing at first. But with enough practice and time, you will start to feel more comfortable using them in your Python programs.
