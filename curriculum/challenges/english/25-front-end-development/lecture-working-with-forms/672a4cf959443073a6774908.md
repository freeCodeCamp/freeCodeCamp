What are the different form states, and why are they important?

In HTML, form controls, like inputs, can be in different stages or conditions like a `focused` state, `readonly` state, or `disabled` state.

The first state would be considered the `default` state. The default state of an email address input is a blank input. That is what the email input looks like when it is first rendered on the page. At this point, the user has not input any information.

When the user clicks on a form control or selects it with the keyboard's tab key, then that means it is in the `focused` state. When an input is in the `focused` state, most browsers will show a blue highlighted border around the input. But you can choose to add additional styles in CSS.

Another form state is the `disabled` state. This state shows users that an input cannot be focused or activated. To disable an input, you can add the `disabled` boolean attribute to the element like this:

```html
<input disabled type="email" name="email" id="email" />
```

If the user tries to click on the input, then the focus will not be enabled. Similar to the `focused` state, you can choose to add additional styles for the `disabled` state using CSS.

Another type of form state is the `readonly` state. This is when a form control, like an input, is not editable by the user. Here is an example of setting an email input to read only:

```html
<input
  readonly
  type="email"
  name="email"
  id="email"
  value="example@email.com"
/>
```

The `value` attribute is used to set the value shown inside the input field. If you tried to click on the input, you would not be able to edit the existing value.

A key difference between the `disabled` state and `readonly` state is that `readonly` can be focused while the `disabled` state cannot.

Understanding the different form states is important because they ensure a smooth user experience by providing clear feedback and guidance while handling errors.
