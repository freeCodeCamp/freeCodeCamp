What are the different types of buttons, and when should you use them?

The `button` element is used to perform a particular action when it is activated. Here is an example of a `button` element with the button text of `Start Game`.

```html
<button>Start Game</button>
```

Other examples of using the `button` element include submitting a form, showing a modal, or toggling a side menu open and closed. The `button` element has a `type` attribute which controls the behavior of the button when it is activated. The first possible value for the `type` attribute would be the `button` type. Here is an example of using the `button` element with the `button` type and a text of `Show Alert`:

```html
<button type="button">Show Alert</button>
```

By default, the button will not do anything when activated. However, you can add some JavaScript code to make the button interactive, such as showing an alert in this case. Another possible value for the `type` attribute is the `submit` value. Here is an example of using a `button` element with the `submit` type:

```html
<form action="">
  <label for="email">Email address:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
  <button type="submit">Submit form</button>
</form>
```

Inside this `form` element, there is a `label` and `input` element for the user's email address. When the user clicks on the submit button, their data will be sent to the server and will be processed. The third possible value for the `type` attribute is the `reset` value. Here is an example of a `form` element with reset and submit buttons:

```html
<form action="">
  <label for="email">Email address:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" />
  <button type="reset">Reset form</button>
  <button type="submit">Submit form</button>
</form>
```

In this modified example, a `label` and `input` element are used to collect the user's email address. When the user clicks on the reset button, then it will clear out all of their input data. It is important to note that reset buttons are usually not the best idea because they could lead to users accidentally resetting their data. Also, multiple buttons in your form could clutter up the user interface.

Another way to create buttons in HTML is to use the `input` element. The `input` element also has a `type` attribute with the possible values of `submit`, `reset`, and `button`. Here is an example of using the `input` element with the `type` set to `button`:

```html
<input type="button" value="Show Alert" />
```

The `value` attribute is used to show the button text. So, what is the difference between using the `input` and `button` elements? `input` elements are void elements, which means they cannot have child nodes, such as text, and can only have a start tag. On the other hand, the `button` element offers more flexibility because you can nest text, images, and icons inside it.
