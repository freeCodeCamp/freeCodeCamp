What is a code editor and IDE?

You might think these are the same thing, but not quite. A code editor is any application that allows you to edit code files. An IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, is a full application that allows you to compile, run, and debug your code while you edit it.

Perhaps some examples might be helpful.

First, let's consider a few popular IDEs. Visual Studio is an integrated development environment by Microsoft that provides a comprehensive suite of tools for building, debugging, and deploying applications across various platforms.

Another IDE is XCode. Xcode is an integrated development environment by Apple designed for creating, coding, and debugging applications for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

And another IDE would be Android Studio. Android Studio is an integrated development environment by Google specifically designed for building, debugging, and testing Android applications.

Those are just a few examples of IDEs. Now, let's take a look at a few popular code editors.

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, open-source code editor by Microsoft that supports a wide range of programming languages and provides features like debugging, syntax highlighting, and version control through extensions.

Another popular editor would be Sublime Text. Sublime Text is a fast, versatile text editor known for its sleek interface, powerful features, and support for a wide range of programming languages through customizable syntax highlighting and plugins.

And another one is Notepad++. This is a free, open-source, text and source code editor for Windows that offers syntax highlighting, code folding, and a range of plugins to enhance productivity and customization.

You may have noticed how the code editors focus primarily on the text contents of the file, where the IDEs expose various tools to manage your code.

These examples are all local programs you can run on your computer, but there are also cloud-based editors that you can use.

A cloud-based editor is an online tool that allows users to write, edit, and manage code or text directly through a web browser without needing to install software locally.

Let's take a look at a few cloud-based editors.

Replit is an online platform that provides a collaborative environment for coding, allowing users to write, run, and share code in various programming languages directly from a web browser.

Another popular cloud-based editor is GitHub Codespaces. This is a cloud-based development environment that provides instant access to a fully-configured code editor and development tools directly from GitHub, enabling seamless coding and collaboration.

And another one is Gitpod. Gitpod is a cloud-based development environment that integrates with GitHub and GitLab, offering instant, customizable workspaces for coding, building, and debugging directly from your browser.

And there are many more options. Some options, such as Visual Studio Code, are highly extensible and can work with multiple different project types and languages. Other options might be specifically tailored to a small subset of languages or project types.

The application you use might be different for specific projects. You should explore the options to see what will work best for your needs.
