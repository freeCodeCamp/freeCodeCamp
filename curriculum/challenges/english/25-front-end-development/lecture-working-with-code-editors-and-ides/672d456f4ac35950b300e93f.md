What are several useful keyboard shortcuts for maximizing productivity in VS Code?

You're likely already familiar with some of the basic shortcuts, which are inherited from your operating system. Shortcuts like `Ctrl + S` to save, `Ctrl + C` to copy, and `Ctrl + V` to paste all work in VS Code.

But there's a few that are application specific and can still level up your productivity. It's worth noting that some of these shortcuts may differ by operating system.

For example, `Shift + Alt + F` will run your configured formatter (such as prettier, for a JavaScript project) on the currently opened file.

Or `Ctrl + Shift + F` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + F` (Mac), to search the text contents of all the files in your workspace. Then `Ctrl + Shift + H` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + H` (Mac), if you want to run a find-and-replace.

If you need to remove a line, `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + K` (Mac), will delete it.

Need some extra room for all your code? `Ctrl + B` (Windows), or `Cmd + B` (Mac), will hide the sidebar - which has the file list and extensions menu.

Or maybe you just can't see your code? `Ctrl + plus` (Windows), or `Cmd + plus` (Mac), will increase the scaling of the editor, and `Ctrl + minus` (Windows), or `Cmd + minus` (Mac), will decrease it.

Finally, if you forget any of these shortcuts, you always have `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac), which opens the command palette for you to select whatever you may need.

With this knowledge, and maybe a little practice, you are well on your way to becoming a VS Code power user.
