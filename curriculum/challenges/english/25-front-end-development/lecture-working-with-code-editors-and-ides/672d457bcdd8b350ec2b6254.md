What are some good VS Code extensions you can use in your editor?

_Better Comments_ is an extension that offers special highlighting for specific code comments. For example, it will call out "TODO" comments, as well as syntax to indicate questions or warnings.

_Code Spell Checker_ offers indication when you have spelled something incorrectly in your code. Because it is designed for code files, it will account for things like camel case.

_Error Lens_ will help you catch any highlighted errors in your code. Rather than having to rely on the underline that VS Code shows by default, this extension highlights the entire line and displays the error message.

_Indent Rainbow_ adds color to your different levels of indentation. In combination with VS Code's native bracket pair colorization, this can dramatically help identify what scope your code is in.

Or maybe you're looking for something a bit more practical? Consider an AI assistant, like _Github Copilot_ or _Tabnine_, to offer you inline suggestions as you are writing your code.

An icon pack, such as _VS Code Great Icons_, can help make your file tree cleaner and easier to parse at a glance. And an extension like _Colorize_ can help you understand the values in your CSS properties.

You'll also want language-specific extensions for your projects. If you are using JavaScript, you will likely want _ESLint_ and _Prettier_ to lint and format your code. If you are using TypeScript, you might want _Pretty Typescript Errors_ for easier to read messages.

Finally, you can also have a bit of fun with your editor. _VS Code Pets_ offers configurable virtual pets to keep you company while you squash some bugs.

_Power Mode_ will create flashy effects when you achieve a high enough "combo" by writing more code.

_Discord Presence_ will let you show off what you're working on to all of your friends.

And there are so many more extensions out there. Feel free to explore the extension marketplace and see what works best for you.
