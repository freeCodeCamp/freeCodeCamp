How to install Visual Studio Code onto your computer.

To install VS Code, you'll want to visit their website to get the appropriate installer for your operating system. Make sure you visit the VS Code website, and not the Visual Studio website.

For Windows, you can download an EXE installer. Once you've downloaded it, run the file and the setup wizard will take you through the installation process.

For Mac, you can download a zip archive which contains a `.app` that you can run. You can also install VS Code via homebrew.

Open up the Terminal app on your Mac and run the following command:

```sh
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

On Linux, you can download a `.deb` or `.rpm` file directly. Once you have it installed, you can use the appropriate executable, or CLI command (typically `code`), to launch the application. And now you're ready to code.
