What is the purpose of the `useActionState` hook in React?

Why can't you use the `useActionState` hook inside a server component?

## --answers--

Because server components do not support state management, making `useActionState` incompatible.

### --feedback--

Hooks only work in a specific type of component.

---

Because `useActionState` requires a database connection, which is only available in client components.

### --feedback--

Hooks only work in a specific type of component.

---

Because `useActionState` is a React hook, and hooks can only be used inside client components.
