What is scope in programming, and how does global, local, and block scope work?

Scope in programming refers to the visibility and accessibility of variables in different parts of your code. It determines where variables can be accessed or modified. In JavaScript, understanding scope is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and bug-free code. There are three main types of scope: global scope, local scope, and block scope.

Global scope is the outermost scope in a JavaScript program. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in your code, including within functions and blocks. These variables are often called global variables. While global variables can be convenient, they should be used sparingly as they can lead to naming conflicts and make your code harder to maintain. Here's an example of a global variable:

```js
let globalVar = "I'm a global variable";

function printGlobalVar() {
    console.log(globalVar);
}

printGlobalVar(); // Output: "I'm a global variable"
```

In this example, `globalVar` is declared in the global scope and can be accessed inside the `printGlobalVar` function.

Local scope, on the other hand, refers to variables that are only accessible within a function. Here's an example of local scope:

```js
function greet() {
    let message = "Hello, local scope!";
    console.log(message);
}

greet(); // Output: "Hello, local scope!"
console.log(message); // This will throw an error
```

In this code, `message` is a local variable within the `greet` function. It can be used inside the function, but trying to access it outside the function will result in an error.

Block scope is a concept introduced with the `let` and `const` keywords in ES6. A block is any code section within curly braces, `{}`, such as in `if` statements, `for` loops, or `while` loops. The concept of loops will be taught in an upcoming lecture. 

Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside a block are only accessible within that block. Here's an example of block scope:

```js
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I'm in a block";
    console.log(blockVar); // Output: "I'm in a block"
}
console.log(blockVar); // This will throw an error
```

In this example, `blockVar` is only accessible within the `if` block. Trying to access it outside the block will result in an error. Understanding these different types of scope is essential for managing variable accessibility and avoiding unintended side effects in your code. 

Global variables should be used sparingly, as they can lead to naming conflicts and make your code harder to maintain. Local variables help to keep different parts of your code isolated, which is especially useful in larger programs. Block scoping with `let` and `const` provides even finer control over variable accessibility, helping to prevent errors and make your code more predictable. Mastering these basic concepts of global, local, and block scope will provide a solid foundation for understanding more advanced topics.

What will be the output of the following code?

```js
let x = 10;

function printX() {

printX();
console.log(x);
```

What will be the result of trying to access `blockVar` outside its block in the following code?

```js
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "Hello";
