# --description--

In this workshop, you will practice working with the `aria-live` and `aria-label` attributes by building an accessible note taking app. 

Most of the HTML and all of the CSS has been provided for you. The first few steps will involve adding the remaining markup. 

If you look at the preview, there is text to tell you to click on the card to edit it. But if you try to do that, it will not work. To make that `div` element editable, you can use the `contenteditable` attribute like this:

```html
<div contenteditable="true"></div>
```

In the opening `div` tag, add the `contenteditable` attribute and set its value to `"true"`. Now you should be able to click on the element and edit the text.

# --hints--

Your opening `div` tag should have the `contenteditable` attribute.

```js
assert.isTrue(document.getElementById("note").hasAttribute("contenteditable"));
```

Your `div` element should have the `contenteditable` attribute set to `"true"`.

```js
assert.equal(document.getElementById("note").getAttribute("contenteditable"), "true");
```

      Many languages have words that carry meanings so specific or culturally rooted that they can't be neatly translated into English. 
        
      One example is the Japanese word "tsundoku", which refers to the habit of acquiring books and letting them pile up unread, something many book lovers can relate to. Another is the Portuguese word "saudade", describing a deep, bittersweet longing for something or someone that is absent. Meanwhile, the French word "DÃ©paysement" captures the disorienting yet exciting feeling of being in a new place, far from home.
        
      These unique words remind us that language is more than vocabulary: it's a window into the values, habits, and emotions of the cultures that create it.
