What is CSS specificity and the specificity for inline, internal, and external CSS?

CSS specificity is a fundamental concept that determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules could apply.

Understanding specificity helps developers resolve conflicts between different CSS rules and ensures that the desired styles are consistently applied.

CSS specificity is calculated based on the type of selectors used.

The highest specificity is attributed to inline styles, which are applied directly to an element through the `style` attribute.

Following this, ID selectors like `#main` and `#header` have a high level of specificity.

Next, class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes come into play.

Examples include class selectors such as `.container` and `.button`, attribute selectors like `[type="text"]`, and pseudo-classes such as `:hover`. These have a moderate level of specificity.

Type selectors, such as `div` and `h1`, and pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, have a lower specificity compared to the previous groups.

Finally, the universal selector, represented by an asterisk `*`, has the lowest specificity of all.

Specificity values are calculated as a four-part value `(a, b, c, d)`:

- `a`: Inline styles (`1` or `0`).
- `b`: Number of ID selectors.
- `c`: Number of class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes.
- `d`: Number of type selectors, pseudo-elements, and universal selectors.

Each part of the specificity value carries different weight:

- **Inline styles** (`a`) have the highest weight, contributing a value of `1` to the first part of the specificity value.
    
- **ID selectors** (`b`) carry the next highest weight, with each ID contributing `1` to the second part of the specificity value.
    
- **Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes** (`c`) carry moderate weight, with each contributing `1` to the third part of the specificity value.
    
- **Type selectors and pseudo-elements** (`d`) have the lowest weight, with each contributing `1` to the fourth part of the specificity value.
    
- **Universal selector** (`*`): The universal selector contributes `0` to the specificity calculation and does not affect specificity. Its inclusion in a selector does not change the specificity value.

Inline CSS has the highest specificity because it is applied directly to the element. It overrides any internal or external CSS. The specificity value for inline styles is `(1, 0, 0, 0)`.

Here is an example using inline styles for a `div` element.

```html
<div style="color: red;">This text is red.</div>
```

In this example, the text will always be red, regardless of any other styles applied via internal or external CSS.

Internal CSS is defined within a `style` element in the `head` section of the HTML document. It has lower specificity than inline styles but can override external styles.

The specificity value for internal styles is determined by the selectors used. For example, an ID selector within internal CSS has a specificity value of `(0, 1, 0, 0)`.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    .text {
      color: blue;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="text">This text is blue.</div>
</body>
```

In this example, the text will be blue unless an inline style or a more specific external style is applied.

External CSS is linked via a `link` element in the `head` section and is written in separate `.css` files. It has the lowest specificity but provides the best maintainability for larger projects.

The specificity value for external styles is also determined by the selectors used. For example, a class selector within external CSS has a specificity value of `(0, 0, 1, 0)`.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="text">This text's color is defined in an external CSS file.</div>
</body>
```

In this example, the text color is defined in the `styles.css` file and will be applied unless overridden by internal or inline styles.
