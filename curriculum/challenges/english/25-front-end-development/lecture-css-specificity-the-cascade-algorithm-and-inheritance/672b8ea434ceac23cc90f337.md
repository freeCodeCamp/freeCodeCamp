What is the specificity for ID selectors?

ID selectors are among the most powerful selectors in CSS, allowing developers to apply styles to specific elements with unique identifiers.

This makes them highly effective for targeting individual elements that need unique styling.

ID selectors are defined by a hash symbol (`#`) followed by the ID name. They should be unique within an HTML document, meaning no two elements should share the same ID.

Here is an example using an ID selector:

```css
#unique {
  color: purple;
}
```

In this example, the element with the ID `unique` will have its text color set to `purple`.

ID selectors have a very high specificity, higher than type selectors and class selectors, but lower than inline styles. The specificity value for an ID selector is `(0, 1, 0, 0)`.

This means that ID selectors can override class selectors and type selectors but can be overridden by inline styles.
