# --transcript--

A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by either single or double quotation marks. In some programming languages, characters surrounded by single quotes are treated differently than characters surrounded by double quotes, but in Python, they're treated equally. So, you can use either when working with strings. Here are some examples of strings:

```python
my_str_1 = 'Hello'
my_str_2 = "World"
```

If you need a multi-line string, you can use triple double quotes or single quotes:

```python
my_str_3 = """Multiline
string"""
my_str_4 = '''Another
multiline
string'''
```

If your string contains either single or double quotation marks, then you have two options:

- Use the opposite kind of quotes. That is, if your string contains single quotes, use double quotes to wrap the string, and vice versa:
    

```python
msg = "It's a sunny day"
quote = 'She said, "Hello World!"'
```

- Escape the single or double quotation mark in the string with a backslash (`\`). With this method, you can use either single or double quotation marks to wrap the string itself:
    

```python
msg = 'It\'s a sunny day'
quote = "She said, \"Hello!\""
```

You can also combine multiple strings together with the plus (`+`) operator. This process is called string concatenation. Here's how to concatenate two strings with the plus operator:

```python
my_str_1 = 'Hello'
my_str_2 = "World"

str_plus_str = my_str_1 + ' ' + my_str_2
print(str_plus_str) # Hello World
```

But note that this only works with strings. If you try to concatenate a string with a number, you'll get a `TypeError`:

```python
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name + age
print(name_and_age) # TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

This happens because Python does not automatically convert other data types like integers into strings when you concatenate them. Python requires all elements to be strings before it can concatenate them. To fix that, you can convert the number into a string with the built-in `str()` function:

```python
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name + str(age)
print(name_and_age) # John Doe26
```

You can also use the augmented assignment operator for concatenation. This is represented by a plus and equals sign (`+=`), and performs both concatenation and assignment in one step. Here's it in action:

```py
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26

name_and_age = name  # Start with the name
name_and_age += str(age)  # Append the age as string

print(name_and_age)  # John Doe26
```

Apart from regular strings, Python also has a category of string called **f-strings**, which is short for formatted string literals. It allows you to handle interpolation and also do some concatenation with a compact and readable syntax.

F-strings start with `f` (either lowercase or uppercase) before the quotes, and allow you to embed variables or expressions inside replacement fields indicated by curly braces (`{}`). Here's an example:

```python
name = 'John Doe'
age = 26
name_and_age = f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old'
print(name_and_age) # My name is John Doe and I am 26 years old

num1 = 5
num2 = 10
print(f'The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}') # The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
```

Now that you've learned about string concatenation and f-strings, let's look at how you can get the length of a string and work with the individual characters in a string, a process called **indexing**. To get the length of a string, you can use the built-in `len()` function. Here's an example:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(len(my_str))  # 11
```

Now onto indexing. Each character in a string has a position called an index. The index is zero-based, meaning that the index of the first character of a string is `0`, the index of the second character is `1`, and so on. To access a character by its index, you use square brackets (`[]`) with the index of the character you want to access inside. Here are some examples:

```python
my_str = "Hello world"

print(my_str[0])  # H
print(my_str[6])  # w
```

Negative indexing is also allowed, so you can get the last character of any string with `-1`, the second-to-last character with `-2`, and so on:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[-1])  # d
print(my_str[-2]) # l
```

Now that you're familiar with indexing, let's take things a bit further with **string slicing**. String slicing lets you extract a portion of a string or work with only a specific part of it. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
string[start:stop]
```

If you want to extract characters from a certain index to another, you just separate the `start` and `stop` indices with a colon:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[1:4]) # ell
```

Note that the `stop` index is non-inclusive, so `[1:4]` just extracted the characters from index `1`, and up to, but not including, the character at index `4`.

You can also omit the `start` and `stop` indices, and Python will default to `0` or the end of the string, respectively. For example, here's what happens if you omit the `start` index:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[:7])  # Hello w
```

This extracts everything from index `0` up to (but not including), the character at index `7`. And here's what happens if you omit the `stop` index:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[8:])  # rld
```

This extracts everything from the character at index `8` until the end of the string.

You can also omit both the `start` and `stop` indices, which will extract the whole string:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[:])  # Hello world
```

Apart from the `start` and `stop` indices, there's also an optional step parameter, which is used to specify the increment between each index in the slice.

Here's the syntax for that:

```python
string[start:stop:step]
```

In the example below, the slicing starts at index `0`, stops before `11`, and extracts every second character:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[0:11:2])  # Hlowrd
```

A helpful trick you can do with the `step` parameter is to reverse a string by setting step to `-1`, and leaving `start` and `stop` blank:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[::-1]) # dlrow olleH
```

It can also be helpful to check if a character or set of characters exist in a string before slicing it. To do that, Python provides the `in` operator, which returns a boolean that specifies whether the character or characters exist in the string or not.

Here are some examples:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'

print('Hello' in my_str)  # True
print('hey' in my_str)    # False
print('hi' in my_str)    # False
print('e' in my_str)  # True
print('f' in my_str)  # False
```
