# --description--

In Python, scope determines the point at which you can access a variable. It's what controls the lifetime of a variable and how it is resolved in different parts of the code.

To correctly determine scope, Python follows the **LEGB** rule, which stands for the following:

- **Local scope (L)**: Variables defined in functions or classes.
    
- **Enclosing scope (E)**: Variables defined in enclosing or nested functions.
    
- **Global scope (G):** Variables defined at the top level of the module or file.
    
- **Built-in scope (B)**: Reserved names in Python for predefined functions, modules, keywords, and objects.

Python uses the LEGB rule to resolve the scope of the variables in your program. We'll dive into each of these rules so you get a better understanding of the process.

**Local scope** means that a variable declared inside a function or class can only be accessed within that function or class.

Here's an example:

```python
def my_func():
    my_var = 10
    print(my_var)
```

In this case, the `my_func` function has its own scope which cannot be accessed from outside the function. Calling `my_func` will output `10`, but printing `my_var` outside the function will lead to a `NameError`:

```python
def my_func():
    my_var = 10 # Locally scoped to my_func
    print(my_var)

my_func() # 10

print(my_var) # NameError: name 'my_var' is not defined
```

**Enclosing scope** means that a function that's nested inside another function can access the variables of the function it's nested within.

For example:

```python
def outer_func():
    msg = 'Hello there!'

    def inner_func():
        print(msg)

    inner_func()

outer_func() # Hello there!
```

In this example, the inner function, `inner_func`, can freely access the `msg` variable defined in the outer function, `outer_func`. However, note that outer functions cannot access variables defined within any nested functions:

```python
def outer_func():
    msg = 'Hello there!'
    print(res)

    def inner_func():
        res = 'How are you?'
        print(msg)

    inner_func()

outer_func() # NameError: name 'res' is not defined
```

That's because `res` is locally scoped to `inner_func`. Also, notice that `outer_func` tries to print `res` before `inner_func` is called.

One solution is to initialize `res` as an empty string in the enclosing scope, which is within `outer_func`. Then within `inner_func`, make `res` a non-local variable with the `nonlocal` keyword:

```python
def outer_func():
    msg = 'Hello there!'
    res = ""  # Declare res in the enclosing scope

    def inner_func():
        nonlocal res  # Allow modification of an enclosing variable
        res = 'How are you?'
        print(msg)  # Accessing msg from outer_func()

    inner_func()
    print(res)  # Now res is accessible and modified

outer_func()

# Output:
# Hello there!
# How are you?
```

**Global scope** refers to variables that are declared outside any functions or classes which can be accessed from anywhere in the program. Here, `my_var` can be accessed anywhere, even inside a function it's not defined in:

```python
my_var = 100

def show_var():
    print(my_var)

show_var() # 100
print(my_var) # 100
```

And if you want to make a locally scoped variable defined inside a function globally accessible, you can use the `global` keyword:

```python
my_var_1 = 7

def show_vars():
    global my_var_2
    my_var_2 = 10
    print(my_var_1)
    print(my_var_2)

show_vars() # 7 10

# my_var_2 is now a global variable and can be accessed anywhere in the program
print(my_var_2) # 10
```

You can also use the `global` keyword to modify a global variable:

```python
my_var = 10  # A global variable

def change_var():
    global my_var  # Allows modification of a global variable
    my_var = 20

change_var()

print(my_var)  # my_var is now modified globally to 20
```

Finally, **built-in scope** refers to all of Python's built-in functions, modules, and keywords, and are available anywhere in your program:

```python
print(str(45)) # '45'
print(type(3.14)) # <class 'float'>
print(isinstance(3, str)) # False
```
