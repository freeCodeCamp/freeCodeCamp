# --description--

Every programming language has some way to output data to the terminal with a built-in method, function, property, or keyword. In Python, you can use the `print` function to print data to the terminal. Let's take a closer look at the `print` function so you can start using it with confidence.

One of the first things you do when you're learning any programming language is to write a simple `Hello world!` program. You can do that really easily in Python with just the `print` function.

To do that, you just need to put the string `Hello world!` in between the opening and closing parentheses you use to call the `print` function:

```python
print('Hello world!') # Hello world!
```

You will learn more about strings and functions in Python in future lectures. For now, just consider strings as a sequence of characters surrounded by either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotation marks.

There's a lot more to the `print` function than first meets the eye. There are four other arguments you can pass to it, so here's the full syntax of the function:

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
```

Note that each of the arguments must be separated by a comma, otherwise you'll get a syntax error. Here are more details about each argument:

- `objects`: The data you want to print. The `*` sign means that you can print multiple things to the terminal by passing in multiple objects (in other words, strings, variables, numbers, and so on) separated by commas.    
- `sep=' '`: The separator between the objects. This defaults to a single space character (`' '`).
- `end='\n'`: What to print at the end of the object. This defaults to a new line character (`'\n'`).
- `file=sys.stdout`: Determines where to send the output. The default is the terminal, but it can be a file.
- `flush=False`: Determines whether to show the output data right away. The default is `False`, which means Python may wait before displaying the output.
    
You might be wondering how the other arguments outside of `object` are useful. Let's take a look at some common use cases.

If you print multiple things at once, they're just separated by spaces by default. For example:

```python
print('Footballers:', 'Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Hazard', 'Kante', 'Okocha')

# Output: Footballers: Ronaldo Messi Hazard Kante Okocha
```

But you can use another separator of your choice with the `sep` argument:

```python
print('Footballers:', 'Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Hazard', 'Kante', 'Okocha', sep=', ')

# Output: Footballers:, Ronaldo, Messi, Hazard, Kante, Okocha
```

In this example, you passed a comma followed by a single space character to `sep`. But the comma in front of the first value, `Footballers:` doesn't make sense, right?

To get rid of that comma, you can move the space to the `Footballers:` string directly, and use a plus sign (`+`):

```python
print('Footballers: ' + 'Ronaldo', 'Messi', 'Hazard', 'Kante', 'Okocha', sep=', ')

# Output: Footballers: Ronaldo, Messi, Hazard, Kante, Okocha
```

This is called string concatenation, which is when you combine multiple strings into one. In this case, you're combing the strings `Footballers:` and `Ronaldo` first, resulting in `Footballers: Ronaldo`, before printing everything to the terminal.

You'll learn more about string concatenation in future lectures.

The `end` parameter lets you avoid a common issue with the `print` function, where it automatically prints a new line when you have multiple of it. Here's an example:

The `end` parameter lets you modify the ending of the output. By default, the end character is a newline character (`\n`), which is helpful in most cases.

But what if you call `print` multiple times in a row?:

```python
print('Footballers:')
print('Ronaldo')
print('Messi')
print('Hazard')
print('Kante')
print('Okocha')

#Output:
# Footballers:
# Ronaldo
# Messi
# Hazard
# Kante
# Okocha
```

To avoid this common issue, you can specify a different value for the `end` argument:

```python
print('Footballers:', end=' ')
print('Ronaldo', end=', ')
print('Messi', end=', ')
print('Hazard', end=', ')
print('Kante', end=', ')
print('Okocha', end='.')

#Output: Footballers: Ronaldo, Messi, Hazard, Kante, Okocha.
```

How cool is that?

Here's how you can use the `file` argument to write the output of the `print` function to a separate file:

```python
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
   print('Hello world!', file=f)
```

This will print the text `Hello world!` into a file named `output.txt`. If the file doesn't exist, it will be automatically created. You will learn more about how working with the filesystem in future lectures.

The last argument of the `print` function we showed in its basic syntax is `flush`. When set to `True`, it immediately shows what you want to print instead of waiting for a short time.

The last argument is `flush`. When this is set to `True`, whatever you're outputting is shown immediately rather than waiting for potential delays in the program's execution:

```python
import time

print('Processing...', end=' ', flush=True)
time.sleep(2)
print('Done!')
```

In this case, the `Processing…` text immediately appears in the terminal, then `time.sleep(2)` delays the `Done` text from appearing for 2 seconds. This makes `flush` a great tool for displaying progress bars and loading text.

And that's how the `print` function works!
