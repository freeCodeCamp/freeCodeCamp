What do logical operators do? 

## --answers--

Perform mathematical calculations with boolean values.

### --feedback--

They help create more complex decision-making logic by working with multiple conditions.

---

What is the primary purpose of comparison operators in programming?

## --answers--

To modify variable values.

### --feedback--

Think about how they evaluate relationships between values.

---

To return `True` or `False` based on value comparisons.

---

To concatenate strings together.

## --text--

What happens when Python evaluates the expression `x or y`?

## --answers--

It returns True only if both `x` and `y` are `True`

### --feedback--

Think about "short-circuiting" and when Python might not need to check the second value.

---

It returns `True` if at least one condition is `True` and may skip evaluating `y`

---

It always evaluates both `x` and `y` regardless of their values

### --feedback--

Think about "short-circuiting" and when Python might not need to check the second value.

---

It returns `False` if either `x` or `y` is `False`

### --feedback--

Think about "short-circuiting" and when Python might not need to check the second value.
