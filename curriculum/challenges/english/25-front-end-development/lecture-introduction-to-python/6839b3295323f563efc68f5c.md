Watch the video or read the transcript and answer the questions below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the main advantage of using augmented assignment operators?

## --answers--

They automatically convert data types.

### --feedback--

Think about how augmented assignments help avoid redundancy and reduce typing mistakes.

---

They prevent all possible syntax errors.

### --feedback--

Think about how augmented assignments help avoid redundancy and reduce typing mistakes.

---

They provide a concise way to update variables without repeating the variable name.

---

They make mathematical operations faster.

## --text--

What happens when you use the increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators in Python?

## --answers--

They work exactly like in C/C++.

### --feedback--

Think about how Python avoids C-style increment and decrement operators.

---

They cause a syntax error and crash the program.

### --feedback--

Think about how Python avoids C-style increment and decrement operators.

---

They are interpreted as double unary operators with no actual increment/decrement.

---

They only work in Python 2 but were removed in Python 3.

### --feedback--

Think about how Python avoids C-style increment and decrement operators.

## --text--

Which augmented assignment operator raises a variable to a power and stores the result back to that variable?

## --answers--

`^=`

### --feedback--

Think about the operator that uses the same symbol as exponentiation operator.

---

`**=`

---

`*=`

### --feedback--

Think about the operator that uses the same symbol as exponentiation operator.

---

`^^=`

### --feedback--

Think about the operator that uses the same symbol as exponentiation operator.
