# --transcript--

Functions are reusable pieces of code that run when you call them. Many programming languages come with built-in functions that make it easier to get started. Python is no exception, and we've already covered some built-in functions like `print()` in previous lectures.

Another helpful built-in function is `input()`, which lets you prompt the user for input:

```python
name = input('What is your name?') # User types "Kolade" and presses Enter  
print('Hello', name) # Output: Hello Kolade
```

On the other hand, `int()` converts a number, boolean, and a numeric string into an integer:

```python
print(int(3.14)) # 3
print(int('42')) # 42
print(int(True)) # 1
print(int(False)) # 0 
```

You can also write your own custom functions. To do that, you use the `def` keyword, followed by the name you want to give your function, a pair of parentheses, and a colon. Then on a new line, you write the code your function should run. The code the function runs is also referred to as the function's body.

Here's an example of a custom function named `hello` that prints the string `Hello World` to the terminal:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello World')
```

To run the function, you need to call it with its name followed by a pair of parentheses:

```python
hello() # Hello World
```

Notice the indentation before `print('Hello World')`. The level of indentation defines a "code block" in Python, which is a group of statements that belong together.

While other programming languages use characters like curly braces to define code blocks, and just use indentation for readability, in Python, code blocks are determined by indentation.

Though you can use either two or four spaces to determine each level of indentation, the Python style guide recommends using four spaces.

Blocks are also found in loops and conditionals, which you'll learn about in future lectures.

Here's another simple function that prints the sum of two numbers to the terminal:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)
```

You can see that our function, `calculate_sum`, has `a` and `b` in its parentheses, separated by a comma. Those are called parameters.Â Think of parameters as placeholder variables that act as "slots" for the values you pass into functions when you call them.

To use the parameters, you have to pass in "arguments". Arguments are the values you pass to a function when you call it.

Here's how to call the `calculate_sum` function to sum together the numbers `3` and `1`:

```python
calculate_sum(3, 1) # 4
```

If you call the function without the correct number of arguments, you'll get a `TypeError`:

```python
calculate_sum()

# TypeError: calculate_sum() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'a' and 'b'
```

Functions also use a special `return` keyword to exit the function and return a value. If you don't explicitly use `return`, Python will return `None` by default.

Here's an example:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)

my_sum = calculate_sum(3, 1) # 4
print(my_sum) # None
```

You can see that the `calculate_sum` function prints the sum of `a` and `b`, but it doesn't return anything explicitly. So when we assign its result to `my_sum`, the value is actually `None`. To fix that, you can use the `return` keyword to send back the result:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

my_sum = calculate_sum(3, 1)
print(my_sum) # 4
```

Now, `calculate_sum` returns the sum of `a` and `b`, which gets stored in `my_sum`.

Decorators are a special kind of function in Python. They are like wrappers for other functions, so they take another function as an argument. With decorators, you get to add extra functionality to a function without modifying its original code. Here's an example of how to use a decorator:

```python
def say_hello():
   name = input('What is your name? ')
   return 'Hello ' + name

def uppercase_decorator(func):
   def wrapper():
       original_func = func()
       modified_func = original_func.upper()
       return modified_func
   return wrapper

say_hello_res = uppercase_decorator(say_hello)

print(say_hello_res())
```

In this code:

- We are getting a user input and storing it in a `name` variable.
    
- The function `say_hello` returns `Hello`, and the `name`.
    
- The decorator, `uppercase_decorator` takes a function, calls it, then turns its return value to uppercase, and returns the original function.
    
- The `uppercase_decorator` function is then called with the original `say_hello` function and saved in `say_hello_res`.
    
- `say_hello_res` is then called and printed in one line.
    

That's how decorators are typically used.
