What is voice recognition software used for?

Voice recognition software helps people with disabilities interact with computers and other digital devices. Let's discuss what voice recognition software is and the role it plays in digital inclusion.

In the context of accessibility, voice recognition tools let people with disabilities use their voice to pass commands to perform various tasks instead of using traditional input devices like keyboards and mice. This includes writing emails and other documents, surfing the net, and controlling smart home devices.

Because voice recognition software tools eliminate the need for physical interaction, they empower people with disabilities with significant independence and control over their environment. 

Here are the specific people who may find voice recognition software significantly helpful:

- People with visual impairments, including those with low-vision or blindness.
- Individuals with mobility impairments, such as limited use of hands and arms or conditions like arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.
- Those recovering from hand or arm injuries.
- Individuals with cognitive disorders, like memory issues or attention deficit disorders.
- Elderly individuals who might find it easier to use voice commands.

Note that people with disabilities are not the only ones who use voice recognition technology. Law enforcement agencies, gamers, drivers, and busy professionals also use voice recognition tools.

A few examples of voice recognition software that allows people to interact with their computer include Voice Control for macOS/iOS, Voice Access for Android, and Windows Speech Recognition for Windows (referred to as Voice Access in the most recent versions of Windows). Dragon by Nuance is a popular third-party voice recognition software for Windows.
