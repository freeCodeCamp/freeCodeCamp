What are alternative pointing devices such as trackballs, joysticks, and touchpads used for?

Alternative pointing devices are input devices that make good alternatives to the traditional mouse. They are essential for improving computer accessibility for those with disabilities, forelimb impairments, and limited mobility.

Common examples of alternative pointing devices are trackballs, joysticks, and touchpads.

A trackball is a stationary pointing device that consists of a large, movable ball within a socket. It also includes additional buttons for clicking and performing other functions.

Unlike the traditional mouse, which requires movement around a surface to control the cursor, a trackball remains in place. Users manipulate the ball directly with their fingers, thumb, or palm to move the cursor on the screen.

Some traditional mice also have a trackball on the top or side. These mice could make a good starting point if you want to gradually switch to a trackball.

Trackballs reduce the physical movement the user needs for navigation, making them ideal for users with mobility issues. 
Apart from that, if you need high precision and have limited desk space, a trackball is more ideal than a traditional mouse.

A joystick is a pointing device primarily designed for games and certain industrial applications like machinery control. It consists of a lever that pivots up, down, left, and right, and often includes additional buttons for various actions

Joysticks provide precise control over movement and actions within digital environments. This makes them popular for flight simulators, cranes, driving games, and other applications requiring precise directional input.

Because joysticks accommodate larger and more deliberate movements, they are beneficial for individuals with tremors and unsteady hands.

They also reduce the strain and pain that comes with repetitive movements, making them ideal for individuals with arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

A touchpad is a flat, touch-sensitive device built into laptops and some keyboards. It allows users to control the cursor on the screen by sliding their fingers across its surface.

Apart from the surface for cursor control, touchpads also feature buttons that emulate the actions of a traditional mouse, such as right-click and left-click.

Most people see touchpads as a better alternative to a mouse because they significantly enhance navigation by supporting multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom, two-finger scrolling, tap-to-click, and three-finger swipes.

Touchpad is ideal for individuals with low arm or hand movement because the forelimb is almost always stationary while using it. It is also suitable for people with arthritis and joint pain because they don't get to move their arms too much.
