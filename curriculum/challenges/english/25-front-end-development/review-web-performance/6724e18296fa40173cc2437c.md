Review the concepts below to prepare for the upcoming quiz.

## Differences Between Real and Perceived Performance

- **Perceived Performance**: This is how users perceive the performance of a website. It's how they evaluate it in terms of responsiveness and reliability. This is a subjective measurement, so it's hard to quantify it, but it's very important, since the user experience determines the success or failure of a website.
- **Real Performance** This is the objective and measurable performance of the website. It's measured using metrics like page load time, server response time, and rendering time. These measurements are influenced by multiple factors related to the network and to the code itself.

## Techniques for improving Perceived Performance 

- **Lazy Loading**: Reducing the initial load time as much as possible by loading non-essential resources in the background is essential. This technique is known as lazy loading. 
- **Minimize Font Delays**: If your website has custom fonts, you should also try to minimize font loading delays, since this may result in flickering or in showing the fallback font while the custom font is being loaded. A suggestion for this is using a fallback font that is similar to the custom font, so in case this happens, the change will be more subtle.
- **Use of Loading Indicators**: showing a loading indicator for a long-running process as soon as the user clicks on an element can help the user feel connected and engaged with the process, making the wait time feel shorter.

## Core Performance Concepts

- **Source order**: This refers to the way HTML elements are structured in the document. This determines what loads first and can significantly impact performance and accessibility.

Some best practices for source order include:

- Placing critical content such as headings, navigation or main text higher in the HTML structure.
- Deferring non-essential scripts such as ones for analytics, or third-party widgets, so they don't block rendering.
- Using progressive enhancement, to ensure the core experience works even before styles and scripts load. Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites and applications based on the idea that you should make your page work with HTML first.

Here is an example of good source order, using the best practices we just went through:

```html
<!-- Good source order: Essential content first -->
<h1>Welcome to FastSite!</h1>
<p>Critical information loads first.</p>
<script src="slow-script.js" defer></script>
```

- **Critical Rendering Path**: This is the sequence of steps the browser follows to convert code into pixels on the screen.
- **Latency**: This is the time it takes for a request to travel between the browser and the server. So in other words, high latency equals slow pages.

Some ways of reducing latency include:

- Using CDNs, or in other words, Content Delivery Networks, to serve files from closer locations.
- Enabling compression using things such as Gzip to reduce file sizes.
- Optimizing images and using lazy loading.

```html
<img src="placeholder.jpg" data-src="real-image.jpg" loading="lazy">
```

## Improving INP

- **Definition**: INP(Interaction to Next Paint) assesses a page's overall responsiveness by measuring the time from when a user interacts—like a click or key press—to the next time the browser updates the display. A lower INP indicates a more responsive page.

Here are some ways to improve INP:

- Reduce main thread work by breaking up long JavaScript tasks.
- Use `requestIdleCallback()` for non-critical scripts. This will queue a function to be called during a browser's idle periods.
- Defer or lazy-load heavy assets which were covered earlier.
- Optimize event handlers. If these handlers run too frequently or perform heavy operations, they can slow down the page and increase INP. The solution for this is debouncing. Debouncing ensures that the function only runs after the user stops typing for a short delay - so for example 300ms. This prevents unnecessary calculations and improves performance.

## How Rendering Works in the Browser

- **How Rendering works**: First the browser parses the HTML and builds the DOM. Next, the browser processes the CSS, constructing the CSS Object Model, or CSSOM. This is another tree structure that dictates how elements should be styled. Finally, the browser paints the pixels to the screen, rendering each element based on the calculated styles and layout. In complex pages, this might involve multiple layers that are composited together to form the final visual output.
