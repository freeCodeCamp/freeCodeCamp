# --description--

To hold the different types of stories, create an object called `storyObj`. The object should have three properties: `scary`, `funny`, and `adventure`. Each property value should be an object with a `story` and a `borderColor` property.

Assign the following values to the individual objects:

- `scary`:
  
  - `story`: `In the dark woods, a group of friends stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin. They enter the cabin and awaken something malevolent that had been dormant for centuries.`
  - `borderColor`: `#ee4b2b`

- `funny`:
  
  - `story`: `During a camping trip, Mark decided to show off his culinary skills by cooking dinner over an open fire. However, his attempt caused him to burn the dinner as well as his eyebrows off.`
  - `borderColor`: `#f1be32`

- `adventure`:
  
  - `story`: `Lost in the heart of the Amazon rain forest, Sarah and Jake stumbled upon an ancient temple. They braved deadly traps and encountered strange wildlife, all while deciphering cryptic clues left behind by a mysterious civilization.`
  - `borderColor`: `#acd157`

# --hints--

You should have an object `storyObj`.

```js
assert.isObject(storyObj);
```

Your `storyObj` object should have three properties: `scary`, `funny`, and `adventure`.

```js
assert.containsAllKeys(storyObj, ['scary', 'funny', 'adventure']);
```

Each property should have a `story` and a `borderColor` property.

```js
assert.containsAllKeys(storyObj.scary, ['story', 'borderColor']);
assert.containsAllKeys(storyObj.funny, ['story', 'borderColor']);
assert.containsAllKeys(storyObj.adventure, ['story', 'borderColor']);
```

The `story` property for `scary` should have the string value of `"In the dark woods, a group of friends stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin. They enter the cabin and awaken something malevolent that had been dormant for centuries."`

```js
assert.equal(
  storyObj.scary.story.replace(/\s+/g, ' '),
  "In the dark woods, a group of friends stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin. They enter the cabin and awaken something malevolent that had been dormant for centuries."
);
```

The `borderColor` property for `scary` should have the string value of `"#ee4b2b"`.

```js
assert.equal(storyObj.scary.borderColor, "#ee4b2b");
```

The `story` property for `funny` should have the string value of `"During a camping trip, Mark decided to show off his culinary skills by cooking dinner over an open fire. However, his attempt caused him to burn the dinner as well as his eyebrows off."`

```js
assert.equal(storyObj.funny.story, "During a camping trip, Mark decided to show off his culinary skills by cooking dinner over an open fire. However, his attempt caused him to burn the dinner as well as his eyebrows off.");
```

The `borderColor` property for `funny` should have the string value of `"#f1be32"`.

```js
assert.equal(storyObj.funny.borderColor, "#f1be32");
```

The `story` property for `adventure` should have the string value of `"Lost in the heart of the Amazon rain forest, Sarah and Jake stumbled upon an ancient temple. They braved deadly traps and encountered strange wildlife, all while deciphering cryptic clues left behind by a mysterious civilization."`

```js
assert.equal(storyObj.adventure.story, "Lost in the heart of the Amazon rain forest, Sarah and Jake stumbled upon an ancient temple. They braved deadly traps and encountered strange wildlife, all while deciphering cryptic clues left behind by a mysterious civilization.");
```

The `borderColor` property for `adventure` should have the string value of `"#acd157"`.

```js
assert.equal(storyObj.adventure.borderColor, "#acd157");
```
