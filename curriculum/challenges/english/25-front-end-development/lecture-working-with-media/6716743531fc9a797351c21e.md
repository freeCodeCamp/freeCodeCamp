What are replaced elements, and what are some examples?

A replaced element is an element whose content is determined by an external resource rather than by CSS itself. CSS, or cascading stylesheets, is used to add styles to a web page. Common examples of replaced elements include the image, iframe, and video elements.

With replaced elements, you can control the position, or layout of an element. But your CSS cannot directly modify the content of that element. This might be easier to explain with some examples. Consider the image element, which embeds an image on your web page:

```html
<img src="example-img-url" alt="Descriptive text goes here">
```

The element itself is replaced with the external object: the image. Your CSS can control things like the positioning of the image, or apply a filter to it, but you cannot actually modify the image itself. A more robust example might be the `iframe` element, which embeds an external site on your web page:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.example.com" title="Example Site"></iframe>
```

Common examples for using the `iframe` element would be to embed Maps or YouTube videos onto the page. The element itself is replaced with the external object: the site. Your CSS can change the positioning of the embedded site, but you cannot modify the site's contents. To dive a bit further, if the embedded site has an `h1` element, your CSS would not be able to style that `h1` element. You cannot change the size, font color, and so on.

There are some other replaced elements, such as `video`, and `embed`. And some elements behave as replaced elements under specific circumstances. Here's an example of an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `image`:

```html
<input type="image" alt="Descriptive text goes here" src="example-img-url">
```

This type of `input` is considered to be a replaced element, but other `input` types like `text`, or `email` are not replaced elements.
