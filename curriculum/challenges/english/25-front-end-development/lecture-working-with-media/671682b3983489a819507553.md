How do you embed videos onto your page using the `iframe` element?

First, what exactly is the `iframe` element? `iframe` stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages. Here's what the syntax of the `iframe` element looks like:

```html
<iframe
  src="video-url"
  width="width-value"
  height="height-value"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The `width` attribute specifies the width of the `iframe`. The `height` attribute specifies the height of the `iframe`. The `allowfullscreen` attribute allows the user to display the `iframe` in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a `title` attribute for the `iframe`, as it's important for accessibility.

To embed a video within an `iframe` you can copy it directly from popular video services like YouTube and Vimeo, or define it yourself with the `src` attribute pointing to the URL of that video. Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube:

```html
<h1>A freeCodeCamp YouTube Video Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
  title="YouTube video player"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

You can then customize the `iframe` to your needs or even define your own by copying the link to the YouTube video and pasting it in as the URL value. The caveat is that you must replace https://youtu.be with https://youtube.com/embed/.

youtu.be is the domain when you copy the share link and youtube.com/embed/ is the domain required for embedding videos with the `iframe` element. Here's an example of that:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://youtube.com/embed/gp5H0Vw39yw?si=Rb_2nDK6abv1iIAM"
  title="freeCodeCamp Typescript Course"
  width="500"
  height="285"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

Note that the video can come from anywhere. It doesn't have to come from video services like YouTube and Vimeo. Here's a video from Pixabay embedded with the `iframe` element:

```html
<h1>A Video from Pixabay Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/video/2022/07/24/125310-733046613_large.mp4"
  width="500"
  height="285"
></iframe>
```

Don't forget you can also embed a map, another web page, or direct HTML within the `iframe` element. Here's a map I was able to embed with the `iframe` element:

```html
<h1>A Map from Openstreetmap.org Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  width="425"
  height="350"
  src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=3.006134033203125%2C6.150112578753815%2C3.6357879638671875%2C6.749850810550778&amp;layer=mapnik"
  style="border: 1px solid black"
>
</iframe>
<br />

  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/6.4501/3.3210">
    View Larger Map
  </a>
</small>
```

If you want to embed direct HTML within the `iframe` element you have to use the `srcdoc` attribute instead of `src`.
