# --description--

In this lab, you will build a hash table from scratch. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. The purpose of a hash table is to allow for constant time lookups of values based on a key. 

The way a hash table works is that it takes a key input and hashes this key in a deterministic way to some numerical value. This numerical value is then used as the actual key the associated value is stored by. Then, if you try to access the same key again, the hashing function will process the key, return the same numerical result, which will then be used to look up the associated value.


**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should define a class named `HashTable` with a `collection` property initialized as an empty dictionary inside its `__init__` method. The `collection` dictionary should store key-value pairs based on the hashed value of the key.

2. The `HashTable` class should have four instance methods: `hash`, `add`, `remove`, and `lookup`.

3. The `hash` method should:

    - Take a string as a parameter.
    - Return a hashed value computed as the sum of the Unicode (ASCII) values of each character in the string. Use the `ord` function for this computation.

4. The `add` method should:

    - Take a key-value pair as parameters and compute the hash of the key
    - Use the computed hashed value to store the key-value pair inside the collection dictionary. 
    - If multiple keys produce the same hash value, their key-value pairs should be stored in a nested dictionary under the same hash value.

5. The `remove` method should:

    - Take a key as a parameter and compute its hash.
    - Remove the corresponding key-value pair from the hash table.

6. The `lookup` method should:

    - Take a key as a parameter.
    - Compute the hash of the key, and return the corresponding value stored inside the hash table. 
    - If the key does not exist in the collection, it should return `None`.
