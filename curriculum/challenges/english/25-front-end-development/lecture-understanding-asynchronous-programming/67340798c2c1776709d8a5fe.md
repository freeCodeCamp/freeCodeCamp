How does the `async` attribute work inside `script` elements and how does it differ from the `defer` attribute?

The `async` and `defer` attributes in HTML `script` elements play a crucial role in how JavaScript files are loaded and executed in web pages. Understanding them can improve your website's performance and user experience. When you include a `script` in your HTML file, it looks like this:

```js
<script src="example.js"></script>
```

When the browser finds this `script` tag, it stops parsing the HTML, downloads the script, executes it, and then continues parsing the HTML. This can slow down the loading of your web page, especially if you have large scripts.

This is where the `async` and `defer` attributes come in. They provide ways to load scripts more efficiently.

Let's start with the `async` attribute:

```js
<script src="example.js" async></script>
```

By adding the `async` attribute to a `script` tag, the browser will continue parsing the HTML while the script is being downloaded. Once the script is fully downloaded, the browser will pause HTML parsing, execute the script, and then resume parsing the HTML. This can significantly speed up page loading.

It's important to note that async scripts are executed as soon as they're downloaded, which means they might not run in the correct order which we desire. This is where the `defer` attribute comes in for the rescue. Let's look at how the `defer` attribute looks like:

```js
<script src="example.js" defer></script>
```

The `defer` attribute is similar to `async` attribute. However, defer scripts are not executed immediately after they're downloaded. Instead, they wait until the HTML parsing is complete. Furthermore, defer scripts execute in the order they appear in the HTML code.

In short, use `async` for scripts where the order of execution doesn't matter, and use `defer` when you need to ensure that scripts run in the correct order. Both attributes can significantly improve page load times by allowing the browser to continue parsing HTML while scripts are being downloaded in the background.

# --questions--

## --text--

What happens when a script tag has both `async` and `defer` attributes?

## --answers--

The script is downloaded asynchronously and executed immediately after download.

### --feedback--

Consider which attribute takes precedence when both are present.

---

The script is downloaded asynchronously and executed after HTML parsing is complete.

### --feedback--

Consider which attribute takes precedence when both are present.

---

The `defer` attribute is ignored, and the script behaves as if only `async` was present.

---

The browser throws an error.

### --feedback--

Consider which attribute takes precedence when both are present.
