# --description--

The bisection method, also known as the binary search method, uses a binary search to find the roots of a real-valued function. It works by narrowing down an interval where the square root lies until it converges to a value within a specified tolerance.

For example, if the tolerance is `0.01`, the bisection method will keep halving the interval until the difference between the upper and lower bounds is less than or equal to `0.01`.

In this lab, you will implement a function that uses the bisection method to find the square root of a number.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User stories**

1. You should define a function named `square_root_bisection` with three parameters:
    - The number for which you want to find the square root.
    - The tolerance being the acceptable error margin for the result. You should set a default tolerance value.
    - The maximum number of iterations to perform. You should set a default number of iterations.

1. The `square_root_bisection` function should:
    - Raise a `ValueError` with the message `Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers` if the number passed to the function is negative.
    - For numbers `0` and `1`, print the message: `The square root of [number] is [number]` and return the number itself as the square root.
    - For any other positive number, print the approximate square root with the message: `The square root of [square_target] is approximately [root]` and return the computed root value.
    - If no value meets the tolerance condition, print a failure message: `Failed to converge within the [maximum] iterations` and return `None`.

**Note**: You cannot import any module for this lab.

# --hints--

You should not import any module.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`len(_Node(_code).find_imports()) == 0`)) })
```

You should have a function named `square_root_bisection`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(runPython(`_Node(_code).has_function("square_root_bisection")`)) })
```

Your `square_root_bisection` function should have three parameters.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
    import inspect 
    sig = inspect.signature(square_root_bisection)
    assert len(sig.parameters) == 3
`) })
```

You should set a default value for the tolerance and the maximum number of iterations.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
try:
  import inspect 
  sig = inspect.signature(square_root_bisection)
  assert len(sig.parameters) == 3
  square_root_bisection(4)
except TypeError:
  assert False
`) })
```

Your `square_root_bisection` function should raise a `ValueError` with the message `Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers` when the number passed to the function is negative.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
try:
  square_root_bisection(-6)
except ValueError as e:
  assert str(e) == "Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers"
else:
  assert False
`) })
```

`square_root_bisection(0)` should return `0`.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`assert square_root_bisection(0) == 0`) })
```
