<!-- (Audio) Bob: Well, I think we should use a slide deck for the presentation. It's the standard format, and it will make the information more accessible. Sarah: True, but I was thinking we could try something different. Let's use an interactive demo instead of slides. It will engage the audience more effectively. Bob: Oh, I see what you mean. That's a great idea. It will certainly grab the audience's attention better. -->
