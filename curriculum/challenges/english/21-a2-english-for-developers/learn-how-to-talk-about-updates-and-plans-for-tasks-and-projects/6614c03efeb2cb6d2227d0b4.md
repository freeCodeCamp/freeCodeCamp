<!-- (Audio) Sarah: True, but I was thinking we could try something different. Let's use an interactive demo instead of slides. It will engage the audience more effectively. -->

# --description--

This task will help you understand and use terms related to presentation techniques. An `interactive` element in a presentation involves audience participation or allows them to influence the course of the presentation. For example, `The interactive quiz in the presentation kept everyone engaged.`

The expression `instead of` is used to talk about choosing one thing over another. It shows what you do not choose. For example, if you say `I had tea instead of coffee`, it means you chose to drink tea and not coffee.

A `demo`, short for demonstration, is a practical display or explanation of how something works. In the context of presentations, a `demo` might involve showing a product or software feature in action. Like saying, `The software demo helped the clients understand its features.`
