<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I think we're going to focus on social media marketing. It's cost-effective, and it will reach a broader audience. Brian: That sounds good. I suggest that we also invest in email marketing. It's more targeted, and it will allow us to engage with our subscribers directly. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Is Brian suggesting to replace social media marketing with email marketing?

## --answers--

Yes, he is proposing email marketing as a replacement for social media marketing

### --feedback--

Brian uses `also` in his statement, indicating an addition, not a replacement.

---

No, he is suggesting it as an additional strategy alongside social media marketing

---

Yes, because email marketing is more cost-effective than social media marketing

### --feedback--

The cost-effectiveness isn't the basis for an alternative choice; Brian is adding to, not replacing, the social media strategy.

---

No, because he thinks social media marketing is ineffective

### --feedback--

Brian's suggestion does not imply that he finds social media marketing ineffective; rather, he's proposing an additional strategy.
