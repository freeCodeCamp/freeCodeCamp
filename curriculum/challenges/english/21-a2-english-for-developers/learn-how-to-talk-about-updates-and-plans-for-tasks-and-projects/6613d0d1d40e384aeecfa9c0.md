# --description--

This task introduces the use of `to be going to` for planned future events. This expression indicates a decision about the future made before speaking.

For example: `We are going to use a framework for the front-end` indicates a decision already made about the project.

`Will` is different. People use `will` for decisions they make while they are speaking. 

Like, `I will help you with your homework` is a decision made at that moment.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence correctly uses `to be going to` for a planned future event?

## --answers--

`I am going to meet my friend tomorrow. We planned it last week.`

---

`I will probably go to the store later. I decided it three days ago.`

### --feedback--

This sentence uses `will`, which is more appropriate for spontaneous decisions made at the moment of speaking, not for pre-planned events.

---

`Tomorrow, I am going to start a new book. I decided on it just now.`

### --feedback--

`Going to` is typically used for plans made before speaking. This sentence indicates a decision made immediately, so `will` would be more appropriate.

`We will have a meeting next week. It was scheduled yesterday.`

### --feedback--

The plan was made before speaking, so `going to` is more appropriate, not `will`.
