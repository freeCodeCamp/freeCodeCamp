<!-- (Audio) Brian: Absolutely. And as for the back-end, I think we’ll use Node.js. It's a solid choice, and it will allow us to scale the application effectively. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Brian want to use Node.js for the back-end?

## --answers--

Because it is a solid choice that will enable effective scaling of the application

---

Because they are still considering other options

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Brian's use of `will` indicates a decision has been made, not that they are still considering.

---

Because they have no other alternatives at the moment

### --feedback--

Brian's choice of words suggests a positive decision for Node.js based on its merits, not a lack of alternatives.

---

Because it is the cheapest option available

### --feedback--

Cost is not mentioned. Brian's statement focuses on Node.js being a solid choice for effective scaling.
