<!-- (Audio) Brian: Absolutely. And as for the back-end, I think we’ll use Node.js. -->

# --description--

`As for` is an element used to shift the focus to another topic or aspect of the discussion. 

For example, in a meeting, after discussing the marketing strategy, you might say, `As for the sales plan, we'll start implementing it next quarter` to change the subject to the sales plan.

# --questions--

## --text--

## --answers--

### --feedback--

Brian's statement does not express uncertainty about the technology. It suggests a confident plan or preference for using Node.js.

---

He wants to delay the decision about the back-end technology.

### --feedback--

Delaying the decision isn't implied.
