# --description--

This task will help you understand terms related to digital marketing. `Email marketing` is a type of marketing that involves sending emails to a group of people to promote products or services. For example, `We use email marketing to inform customers about new offers.`

`To be targeted` means focusing on a specific group of people. In marketing, this could mean sending messages to people who are most likely interested in your product. Like saying, `Our campaign is targeted at young adults.`

`Subscribers` are people who sign up to receive emails or updates from a website or company. For instance, `Our newsletter has over 1,000 subscribers.`
