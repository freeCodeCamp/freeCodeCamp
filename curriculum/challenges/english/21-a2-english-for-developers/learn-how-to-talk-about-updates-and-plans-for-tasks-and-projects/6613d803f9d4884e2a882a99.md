Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Sarah mean when she says `we're on the same page`?

## --answers--

They need to review the project plans again for clarity.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. `On the same page` implies that they already have clarity and agreement, not that they need further review.

---

There is a disagreement in the team about the project plans.

### --feedback--

`Being on the same page` actually indicates agreement, not disagreement.

---

They have different opinions about what tasks to assign next.

### --feedback--

The phrase suggests agreement, not different opinions about the tasks.

---
