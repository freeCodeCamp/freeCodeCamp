<!-- (Audio) Bob: That's my mistake too. It's definitely 3 trays of salad. -->

# --description--

A `mistake` is when something is not correct. For example, if you calculate that 2 plus 2 equals 5, you have made `mistake` because the correct answer is 4. It means something is not right.

`Definitely` means you are very sure about something and there is no doubt. For example, if someone asks if you are coming to the party and you are certain you will go, you can say, `Definitely!` It shows strong agreement or certainty.

Listen to Bob and fill in the blanks.
