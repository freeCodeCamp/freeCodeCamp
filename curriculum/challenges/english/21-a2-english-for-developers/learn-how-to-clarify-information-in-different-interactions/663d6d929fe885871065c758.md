<!-- (Audio) Brian: Let me clarify. I believe the documentation is outdated. -->

# --description--

`To clarify` means to make something clear or easier to understand. For example, if someone doesn't understand your instructions, you can say `Let me try to clarify the instructions for you`. This means you will try to explain them in a simpler way.

`Outdated` means something is old and not useful anymore. For example, if you have an old phone that can't run new apps, it is `outdated`. It's the opposite of `updated`, which is when something has the most current information available.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
