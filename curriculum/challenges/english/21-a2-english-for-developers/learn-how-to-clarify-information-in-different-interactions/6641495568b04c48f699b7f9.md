<!-- (Audio) Brian: The budget we agreed upon was indeed $15,000, not $10,000. It should cover all the expenses. Maria: Got it, Brian. Thanks for clearing that up. -->

# --description--

`Got it!` means you understand something. For example, if someone explains how to do a task and you understand, you can say, `Got it!` It means you know what to do now.

`To clear up` means to make something easy to understand or to fix a misunderstanding. For example, if there is confusion about meeting time and you explain it clearly, you can ask if you `cleared up` the confusion. It means you make everything clear for everyone involved.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does Maria react to Brian's comment.

## --answers--

She understands there was a mix-up and thanks Brian for the clarification

---

She goes to the bank to get the extra money necessary

### --feedback--

There is nothing in the dialogue that gives out that idea.

---

She says she got the money

### --feedback--

Even though she uses the verb `got` in her answer, that's not what she means.

---

She thanks Brian for cleaning the office

### --feedback--

That's not what Brian did. He just explained that there was a mix-up.
