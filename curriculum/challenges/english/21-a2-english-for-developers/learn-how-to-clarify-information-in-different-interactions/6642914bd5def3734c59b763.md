<!-- (Audio) Bob: I think I confused it with another event. Sorry. Maria: That's okay. And for the vegetarian options, you mentioned 5 large trays of salad, but I think 3 large trays is enough. -->

# --description--

A `tray` is a flat, shallow container used to carry or hold things. For example, you use a `tray` to bring food or drinks from the kitchen to the table.

`Enough` means having as much as you need. For example, if you have `enough water`, it means you have all the water you need to drink and you don't need more. It can be used to talk about quantity, like having `enough food`, or to talk about quality, like when something is `good enough`.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
