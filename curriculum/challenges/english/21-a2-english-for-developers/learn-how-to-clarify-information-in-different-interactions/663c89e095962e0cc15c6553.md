<!-- (Audio) Tom: Is it a type of rare plant? Alice: Not really. It's a design element. It imitates real world objects in digital interfaces. -->

# --description--

A `skeuomorph` is a virtual object in a digital interface that resembles an object from real life. In calendar applications, for instance, you can have an image that looks very similar to a physical calendar to give you the sensation of familiarity.

# --questions--

## --text--

What can we conclude from the dialogue?

## --answers--

Tom is absolutely right

### --feedback--

No, he isn't. He thought `skeuomorph` was a plant, but it's not.

---

`Skeuomorph` is a digital plant

### --feedback--

A `skeuomorph` could be a virtual image that looked like a plant, but there's more to it.

---

Alice came up with a non-existing word just to win the game

### --feedback--

Not really. It's a strange word, but it does exist.

---

Tom didn't guess the meaning of `skeuomorph` and Alice explained to him what it is
