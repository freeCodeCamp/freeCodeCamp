<!-- (Audio) Bob: You know, now that I think about it, I think I confused it with another event. Sorry. -->

# --description--

`Now that I think about it` means you have remembered or realized something after thinking more. For example, if you forgot where you put your keys but then remember, you might say, `Now that I think about it, they are on the table.` It means you have thought again and found new information.

`To confuse something with something else` means to mix up two things and think one is the other. For example, if you see someone’s twin and think it is your friend, you can say `Sorry. I confused your twin with you`. It means you mistake one thing for another.

# --questions--

## --text--

What seemed to be Bob's mix-up?

## --answers--

Bob thought this was a private birthday party

### --feedback--

Not really. They were both discussing the team party from the beginning.

---

Bob thought everybody in the team was a vegetarian

### --feedback--

If he did, they wouldn't be discussing `chicken wings`, would they?

---

Bob thought he was talking with Maria's twin sister

### --feedback--

The twin was just used as an example.

---

Bob probably thought about another team party
