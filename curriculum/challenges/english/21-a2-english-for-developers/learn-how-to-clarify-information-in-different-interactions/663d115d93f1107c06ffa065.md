<!-- (Audio) Maria: Well, the documentation says we're starting the testing phase next week, but you mentioned it was the following week. -->

# --description--

Previously, you saw that, in order to talk about something that is happening at the moment you are speaking, you can use the `Present Continuous` tense (verb `to be` + a verb in the `-ing` form). It is possible, however, to use the same structure to talk about future events that are already part of a schedule. Example: If a doctor says `I am seeing a patient at 4.`, they mean there is a patient scheduled to see them at that time. The event will happen in the future, but it is possible to use the `Present Continuous` tense to express it.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Well, the documentation says weBLANK BLANK the testing phase next week, but you mentioned it was the following week.`

## --blanks--

`'re`

### --feedback--

This blank has the contraction of the verb `to be` that follows `we`.

---

`starting`

### --feedback--

A verb similar to `begin`. It's in the `Present Continuous` tense to express a schedule future event, so use the `-ing` form.
