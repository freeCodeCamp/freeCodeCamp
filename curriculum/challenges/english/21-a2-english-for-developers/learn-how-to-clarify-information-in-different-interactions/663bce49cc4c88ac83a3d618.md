<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Alice, want to play a guessing game? I'll name some objects with strange names and you try to guess what they are. -->

# --description--

`To guess` means to try to answer or think of something when you are not sure if it is correct. For example, if you do not know someone's age, you can say, "I guess they are 20 years old.", meaning you think they are 20, but you're not sure of it.

`To name` means to say the name of something or someone. For example, if you see a picture of an animal and say "This is a dog," you are saying this is the name - in this case, the breed - of the animal.

Finally, a `guessing game` is a fun activity where you try to guess the right answer. For example, someone might describe an object or name it (if the name is a strange word), and you have to guess what it is.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks accordingly.
