<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Alice, want to play a guessing game? I'll name some objects with strange names and you try to guess what they are. -->

# --description--

`To guess` means to try to answer or think of something when you are not sure if it is correct. For example, if you do not know someone's age, you can say, `I guess they are 20 years old.`, meaning you think they are 20, but you're not sure of it.

`To name` means to say the name of something or someone. For example, if you see a picture of an animal and say `This is a dog,` you are saying this is the name - in this case, the breed - of the animal.

Finally, a `guessing game` is a fun activity where you try to guess the right answer. For example, someone might describe an object or name it (if the name is a strange word), and you have to guess what it is.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks accordingly.
