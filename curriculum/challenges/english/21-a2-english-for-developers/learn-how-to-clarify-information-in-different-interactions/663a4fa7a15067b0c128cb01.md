<!-- (Audio) Sophie: He's got long dark hair and does not wear glasses. -->

# --description--

When using the third person singular (`he`, `she`, or `it`) in the `Simple Present` tense, you normally add an `-s` to the end of a verb. For example, `he wears glasses`. However, when using the negative form, the `-s` goes to the auxiliary verb `do` and gets an extra `e`, forming `does`, combined with `not` and the verb in the regular form. Example: `he does not wear glasses`.

One typical characteristic used to describe a person is to mention that they normally have or don't have their glasses on.

Listen to Sophie's description of Tom and fill in the blanks.
