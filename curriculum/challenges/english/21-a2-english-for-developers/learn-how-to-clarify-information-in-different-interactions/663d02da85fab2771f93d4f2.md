# --description--

Listen to the dialogue and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why is Brian confused?

## --answers--

Because he checked the schedule more than once to make sure it was correct

---

Because he does not know when the project starts

### --feedback--

He checked the dates more than once. He must know the starting date.

---

Because he did not read the documentation

### --feedback--

He says he checked it, so that might not be the case.

---

Because he's not part of the team responsible for this project.

### --feedback--

He is and it seems he is responsible for checking these details as well.
