<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Does that help? Delivery Man: Absolutely. Thanks for the description. -->

# --description--

`Absolutely` means completely or 100%. You use it to show you agree very strongly or to say something is very true. For example, if someone asks `Do you want some ice cream?` and you really do, you can say, `Absolutely!`
