<!-- (Audio) Tom: You're on the right track. It's a kind of coffee machine. Alice: Ah, got it. Okay, your turn. -->

# --description--

When someone explains something to you and you want to tell them you understood what was being said, you can simply say `got it`. That means you understood the explanation.

`Your turn` means it is your time to do something in a game or activity. For example, if you are playing a board game and someone says, `it's your turn`, it means you should play next. `Turns`, in this context, are the times when different people do something one after the other.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
