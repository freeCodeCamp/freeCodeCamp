<!-- (Audio) Tom: Interesting. Alright, how about 'sphygmomanometer'? Alice: Whoa, that's a mouthful. -->

# --description--

`Whoa` is a word you say when you are surprised or amazed by something. For example, if you see a big, beautiful rainbow, you might say, `Whoa!` to show you are impressed. It can also be used to tell someone to stop or slow down.

When you say something is `a mouthful`, you mean that something (like a word or sentence) is long or difficult to say. For example, if a word or name has many letters and sounds, you can say `it's a mouthful`. It means it is hard to say it all at once.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
