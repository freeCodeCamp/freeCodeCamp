<!-- (Audio) Brian: I believe the documentation is outdated. We discussed it yesterday and we decided to move the testing phase a week later. -->

# --description--

Listen to Brian and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

According to Brian, what could have been the reason for the outdated documentation?

## --answers--

The decision was yesterday, so there was probably little time to update the documentation

---

The person responsible for the documentation hasn't been to the office since the meeting

### --feedback--

It is not clear that it is a problem with the person responsible for the documentation. Maybe there was no time to update it.

---

They did not find the documentation to update it.

### --feedback--

Maria checked the documentation before talking to Brian. They knew where it was.

---

Nothing was decided in relation to the schedule, so no one knew the schedule

### --feedback--

Not really. According to Brian, they decided to move the testing phase a week later yesterday.
