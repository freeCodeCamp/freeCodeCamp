<!-- (Audio) Bob: I just wanted to make sure everyone has enough choices. -->

# --description--

To `make sure` means to check something carefully to be certain that it is correct or that something has been done. For example, you can say `I wanted to make sure the door is locked`, when you check the lock to confirm it is secure.

`Choices` are the different options you can pick from. For example, if you are choosing a flavor of ice cream, the `choices` might be chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. It means you have more than one possibility to select from.

Listen to Bob and fill in the blanks.
