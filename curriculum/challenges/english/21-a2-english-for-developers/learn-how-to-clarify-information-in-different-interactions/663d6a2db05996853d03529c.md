<!-- (Audio) Maria: Well, the documentation says we're starting the testing phase next week, but you mentioned it was the following week. -->

# --description--

Listen to the dialogue and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What caused the confusion?

## --answers--

They lost the documentation

### --feedback--

If that were true, Maria would not have noticed the difference in the schedule.

---

A one-week difference between what is in the documentation and what Brian said

---

Maria read the documentation of a different project

### --feedback--

Not really. The documentation is the right one, but the project schedule differs from what Brian said.

---

Brian caused the confusion by mentioning one schedule and writing a different one in the documentation

### --feedback--

It's not mentioned at any moment that Brian wrote the documentation. Another person could have done it.
