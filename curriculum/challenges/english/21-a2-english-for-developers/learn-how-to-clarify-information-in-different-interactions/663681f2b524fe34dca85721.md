<!-- (Audio) Alice: What does she do on the team? Tom: She's a UX/UI designer. She's really creative. -->

# --description--

Let's talk a little about occupations in tech.

`UX (User Experience)` is about how easy and enjoyable it is to use something like a website or an app. It focuses on making sure everything works well and feels nice to use.
`UI (User Interface)` has to do with how things on a website or app look and where you find them. It includes the buttons you click, the colors, and the layout. It's about making sure everything looks good and is easy to find.

If you are a `UX designer`, a `UI designer`, or a `UX/UI designer`, you are the person responsible for making websites and apps easy to use and look nice.

Listen to the sentences and fill in the blanks.
