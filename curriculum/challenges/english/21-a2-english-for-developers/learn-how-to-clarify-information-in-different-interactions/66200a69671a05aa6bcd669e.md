<!-- (Audio) Tom: She's a colleague with long wavy brown hair and bright brown eyes. -->

# --description--

When you describe someone's hair, you usually talk about three things: color, type, and length.

Color: This is the shade of the hair. Common colors are `black`, `brown`, `blonde`, `red`, and `gray`.

Type: This describes how the hair looks and feels. Types of hair include `straight` (no curves), `wavy` (somewhat growing in curves), and `curly` (spiralling down).

Length: This tells us how long the hair is. Hair can be `short` (above the ears), `medium` (around the shoulders), or `long` (past the shoulders).

In English, however, the sequence of adjectives is important. You'll frequently describe a person's hair by first informing how long it is, then informing its type, and finally the color. For example, you might say someone has `short, curly, blonde hair`.
