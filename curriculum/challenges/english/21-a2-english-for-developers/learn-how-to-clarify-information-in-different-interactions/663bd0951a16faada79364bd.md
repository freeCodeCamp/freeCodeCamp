<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Alice, want to play a guessing game? I'll name some objects with strange names and you try to guess what they are. Alice: Sounds fun. -->

# --description--

`Fun` is when you enjoy yourself and feel happy doing something. For example, `Playing games with friends or going to the park can be fun`, because playing games is something that makes you smile and feel good.

# --questions--
