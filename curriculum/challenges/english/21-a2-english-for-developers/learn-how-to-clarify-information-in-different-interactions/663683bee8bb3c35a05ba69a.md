<!-- (Audio) Tom: She's a UX/UI designer. She's really creative. -->

# --description--

A `creative` person is someone who likes to make new things or think of new ideas. They might work with art, write stories, or come up with new ways to solve problems. `Creativity` is about using imagination to make something unique or different.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is Tom's opinion about Lisa?

## --answers--

She is a very logical person and her work always follows the rules

### --feedback--

That is not a very good thing for someone who needs to use their creativity all the time.

---

She has great ideas to find solutions to problems.

---

Tom doesn't like her very much

### --feedback--

Probably he wouldn't praise her as being `creative` if he did not like her.

---

She thinks her works are unimaginative

### --feedback--

On the contrary, if he thinks she's `creative`, he believes in her imagination.
