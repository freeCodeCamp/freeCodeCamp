<!-- (Audio) Maria: Well, the documentation says we're starting the testing phase next week, but you mentioned it was the following week. -->

# --description--

`Next` means the thing that comes immediately after the current one. For example, `next month` means the `month` right after this one.

`The following` means the thing that comes right after another mentioned thing. For example, if you talk about something happening in two weeks, you can say `the following week` after `next week`. It means it comes after something else you just talked about.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
