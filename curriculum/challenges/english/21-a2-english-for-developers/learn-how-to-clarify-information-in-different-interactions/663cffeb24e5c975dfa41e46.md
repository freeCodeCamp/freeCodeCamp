<!-- (Audio) Brian: Really? That's strange. I double checked the project schedule and it should be accurate. -->

# --description--

`Double check` means to look at something again to make sure it is correct. For example, you can say `I wanted to be sure I locked the door, so I double checked it`. It means you are being careful to avoid mistakes, so you are checking what you did again.

A `schedule` is a plan that shows when things will happen. For example, a `school schedule` shows what time classes start and end. It helps you know what to do at different times of the day. In a project, you could use it to estimate the days certain parts of the project start and end.

`Accurate` means something is correct and has no mistakes. For example, if a clock shows the right time, it is `accurate`. It means the information is true and exact.
