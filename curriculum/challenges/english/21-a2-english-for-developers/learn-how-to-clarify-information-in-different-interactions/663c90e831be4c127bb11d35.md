<!-- (Audio) Alice: Is it a medical device? Tom: You're absolutely right. It's the device that doctors use to measure your blood pressure. -->

# --description--

Your `blood pressure` is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps it around your body. Doctors check `blood pressure` to see how healthy your heart is.

`To measure` means to find out the size, amount, or length of something using a tool. For example, you can say `I used a ruler to measure my height`, or `You measure time with a clock`. It helps you know how big or small something is.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
