<!-- (Audio) Brian: I think there's a mix-up there. The budget we agreed upon was indeed $15,000, not $10,000. -->

# --description--

A `mix-up` is a mistake where things get confused or put in the wrong order. For example, if two friends go to meet at different places because they understood different locations, that is a `mix-up`. It means there was a mistake in understanding and they ended up in the wrong places.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blank.
