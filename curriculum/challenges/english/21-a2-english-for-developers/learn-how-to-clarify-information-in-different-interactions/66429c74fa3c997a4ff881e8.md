<!-- (Audio) Bob: I just wanted to make sure everyone has enough choices. Maria: And you're totally right to think this way. Thanks for double checking anyway. -->

# --description--

When you say `You're right to think this way`, you mean that the other person's way of thinking about something is correct or reasonable. For example, if you think a task will be hard and someone says, `You're right to think this way`, they agree that the task is indeed hard and understand why you think so.

In this context, `anyway` is used to show that you are grateful for something despite any difficulties or problems. For example, if someone tried to help you even though it was hard for them, you might say, `Thanks, anyway`, to show you appreciate their effort even if things didn't turn out perfectly.
