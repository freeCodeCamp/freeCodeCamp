Listen to Maria and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What was the budget allocation issue Maria found?

## --answers--

She got an email saying the allocation was $5,000 less than what Brian mentioned

### --feedback--

Actually, it was $5,000 more than what Brian mentioned, not less.

---

Brian mentioned a budget allocation with more money than what she saw in the email

### --feedback--

The budget mentioned in the email had more money than what he mentioned, not the opposite.

---

There was a $5,000 difference between the budget allocation in the email and the one Brian mentioned 

---

The company doesn't have the amount of money the budget allocation requires

### --feedback--

There is no mention to the fact that the company does not have the money required.
