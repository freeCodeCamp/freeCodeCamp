<!-- (Audio) Maria: Hey Brian, I was looking at the project details and I noticed something a bit odd. -->

# --description--

`A bit` means a small amount of something. For example, if you are a little hungry, you can say `I'm a bit hungry`. It means you're hungry, but not very much.

`Odd` means something that is strange or unusual. For example, you can say `it is odd to wear a heavy coat on a hot day`, because it is not what you expect. It means it is different from normal or from what you expected it to be.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
