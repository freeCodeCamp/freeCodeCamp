<!-- (Audio) Bob: Well, you mentioned we need 10 pounds of chicken wings, but I thought we agreed on 20 pounds. Maria: That's strange. I'm sure we decided on 10 pounds because it's a small gathering. Are you sure it's 20 pounds? -->

# --description--

`That's strange` means you think something is unusual or unexpected. For example, if you see it snowing in the summer, you might say, `That's strange.` It means you did not expect that to happen.

`I'm sure` means you are confident that something is true. For example, if you know your friend's birthday is tomorrow, you can say, `I'm sure it's tomorrow.` It means you believe it without doubt.

Listen and fill in the blanks.
