<!-- (Audio) Tom: If you see her today, she's wearing a black and green jacket and a beige shirt. -->

# --description--

Now it's time to introduce some pieces of clothing in English. In this lesson, Tom mentions two pieces that you normally wear on the upper part of your body.

A `jacket` is a piece of clothing you wear over your other clothes to keep warm or dry. It usually has long sleeves and a zipper or buttons in the front.

A `shirt` is a piece of clothing that covers your upper body. It can have short or long sleeves and usually buttons or a collar. You wear it under a jacket or on its own. Do not confuse it with a `T-shirt`, which is normally more informal and has no buttons on.
