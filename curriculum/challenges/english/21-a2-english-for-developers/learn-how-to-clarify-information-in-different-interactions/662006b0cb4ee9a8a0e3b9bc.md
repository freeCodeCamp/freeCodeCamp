<!-- (Audio) Tom: She's a colleague with long wavy brown hair and bright brown eyes. -->

# --description--

When you describe a person physically, some of the characteristics that come to mind in the first place are related to this person's `hair` and `eyes`. This is because these characteristics stand out when we see a person. People's `hair` grows on top of their heads, and it can be different colors and lengths. People's `eyes` are the two parts of your face you use to see. You look through them to see everything around you and they can be of different colors.

Listen and fill in the blanks.
