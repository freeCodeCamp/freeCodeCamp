<!-- (Audio) Delivery Man: Hi there. I have a package for Tom. Do you know him? Sophie: Yes, I do. -->

# --description--

A quick review: when you ask questions with `do` or `does`, a short way to answer them in English is to use the same verb in the answer. For instance, if someone asks you `Do you study English?`, you could answer `Yes, I study English` or `No, I don't study English`. This, however, is not necessary. Since you have `do` in the question, you could simply answer by saying `Yes, I do.` or `No, I don't.`

Practice this by listening to the dialogues and filling the blanks.
