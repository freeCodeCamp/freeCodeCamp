<!-- (Audio) Anna: That's excellent. Were there any specific projects you'd like to mention? -->

# --description--

Questions in the past tense with the verb `to be` are very similar to how you do it in the present tense. The only difference is that you need to remember to conjugate the verb to `were` or `was`, followed by the subject and then the main verb. For example:

 `Were you at the meeting yesterday?` Notice how `were` comes before `you` to for a question. 
 `What was my assignment?` For a specific question, notice how `was` comes after `what` and before `my`. 

# --question--

## --text--

How does Anna ask about specific projects in the past tense?

## --answers--

`Where there any specific projects you'd like to mention?`

### --feedback--

`Where` is used for locations. The correct form for asking about past events is `Were`.

---

`Were there any specific projects you'd like to mention?`

---

`Was there any specific projects you'd like to mention?`

### --feedback--

`Was` is used with singular nouns. Since `projects` is plural, `Were` is the correct choice.

---

`Are there any specific projects you'd like to mention?`

### --feedback--

`Are` is present tense. The question is about past projects, so `Were` is needed.
