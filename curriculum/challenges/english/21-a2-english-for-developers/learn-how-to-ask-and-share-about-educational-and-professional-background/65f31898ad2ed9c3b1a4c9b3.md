In everyday conversations, you can use a structure where you start with a statement, and then use `but` to show contrast. This can be especially useful when you want to show how you've turned challenges into learning opportunities.

For example, you can say, `I didn't have much experience in this field, but I learned a lot about consistency in my previous job.`
