# --description--

`Most` is an adjective you can use when to talk about the biggest part of something. For exmaple:

`We completed most of our work before lunch,` it means a group finished the biggest part of their work.

`Mostly` is an adverb. You use it to talk about what something is like most of the time. For exemple: 

`The office is mostly quiet in the mornings,` means that usually, in the mornings, the office is quiet.

So, `most` talks about a big part of something, and `mostly` tells you what usually happens or what something is like most of the time.
