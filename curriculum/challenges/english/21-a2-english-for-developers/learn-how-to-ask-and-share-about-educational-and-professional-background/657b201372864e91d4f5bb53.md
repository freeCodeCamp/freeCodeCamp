<!-- (Audio) Brian: I studied at a small college as well and majored in information technology. -->

# --description--

The rule for conjugating verbs in the past tense that end with `y` depends on the letter before the `y`. Here's how it works:

If the verb ends with a **vowel followed by `y`** simply add `-ed` to the end of the verb. For example: `Stay` becomes `stayed`.

If the verb ends with a **consonant followed by `y`**, change the `y` to `i` and add `-ed`. For example: `study` becomes `studied`.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I BLANK at a small college as well and BLANK in information technology.`

## --blanks--

`studied`

### --feedback--

The past simple tense of `study` is formed by changing `y` to `i` and adding `ed`.

---

`majored`

### --feedback--

This word follows the regular past simple tense formation by just adding `ed`.
