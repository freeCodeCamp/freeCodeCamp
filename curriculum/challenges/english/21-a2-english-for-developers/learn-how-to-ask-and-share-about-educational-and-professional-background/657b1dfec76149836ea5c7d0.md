# --description--

There are some verbs you can't use `didn't` to create negative sentences in the past. The verb `to be`is one of them. 

If you want to create a negative sentence using the verb `to be` in the past, simply  add `not` after `was` or `were`. For example:

`It was working normally` -> `It wasn't working normally`.

`They were informed earlier` -> `They weren't informed earlier`.

`Wasn't` is the abbreviation of `was not` and `weren't` the abbreviation of `were not`.
