# --description--

There are some verbs you can't use `didn't` to create negative sentences in the past. The verb `to be`is one of them. 

If you want to create a negative sentence using the verb `to be` in the past, simply  add `not` after `was` or `were`. For example:

| Affirmative | Negative |
| --- | --- |
| `It was working normally.` | `It wasn't working normally.` |
| `They were informed earlier.` | `They weren't informed earlier.` |

`Wasn't` is the contraction of `was not` and `weren't` the contraction of `were not`.
