<!-- (Audio) Anna: During my last year, I took a course in organizational psychology. -->

# --description--

The word `last` helps you talk about the time that just passed. 

When you say `last year`, it means the year that finished before this one. 
`Last month` is the month that ended before this one. 
And `last week` is the week that came before this week. 

Using words like `last year`, `last month`, `last week`, or `last day` is a way to talk about things that happened not too long ago.

# --questions--

## --text--

When someone mentions in a discussion about changes, `I switched careers last year.` What does `last year` indicate about the timing of their career change?

## --answers--

They are planning to switch careers in the near future

### --feedback--

This suggests a future action, but `last year` indicates the change already occurred in the past.

---

They have been considering a career change for a long time

### --feedback--

Though they might have considered it for a long time, `last year` specifically identifies when the change took place.

---

The career change is happening currently

### --feedback--

`Last year` refers to a completed action in the past, not something happening in the present.

---

The career switch happened in the previous year
