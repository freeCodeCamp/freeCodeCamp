<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I didn't study computer science at university, but I majored in electrical engineering. -->

# --description--
For most verbs, if you want to make a negative sentence in the past tense, simply put `didn't` in front of the main verb. 
`Didn't` is short for `did not`. 

Remember that the main verb stays in its simple form. Only the auxiliary verb `did` is conjugated. For example: 

**Affirmative sentence in the past**: `I worked yesterday` - The Verb `work` is conjugated to the past.

**Negative sentence in the past**: `I didn't work yesterday` - Only the auxiliary verb is conjugated to the past.
