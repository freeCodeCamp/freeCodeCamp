# --description--

The simple past tense in English is used for actions or situations that were completed in the past. Regular verbs in the past tense usually end with `-ed`, while irregular verbs have unique past forms. For example, as you learned in previous tasks, `was` and `were` are the past forms of `is` and `are`.

Examples of simple past tense:

- `I worked at a company.` (`work` becomes `worked`)
- `I was happy.` (`is` becomes `was`)
- `We were busy.` (`are` becomes `were`)
