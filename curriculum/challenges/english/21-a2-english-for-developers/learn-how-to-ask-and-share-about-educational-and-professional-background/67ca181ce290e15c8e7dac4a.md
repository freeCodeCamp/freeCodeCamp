## --sentence--

`Brian: Hey, how's it going? I noticed you're relatively new here. What's your background in tech?`  

`Sophie: Hey! Yeah, I BLANK the team a few months ago. I didn't study computer science at university, but I BLANK electrical engineering. It wasn't exactly tech-related, but I learned a lot about problem-solving and critical thinking.`  

`Brian: That's interesting! So, you didn't BLANK many programming projects during your studies, did you?`

`Brian: I see. Did you enjoy your time there, even if it wasn't entirely tech-focused?`  

`Sophie: I did. It was challenging, but I met some fantastic people. We had a bunch of fun coding marathons, although I BLANK a very strong programmer.`  

`Brian: Well, we all have different journeys. I studied at a small college as well and majored in information technology. It was more hands-on, and I loved every bit of it. We didn't have to wear too many hats, but I BLANK build and maintain networks and manage a few small projects.`  

`Sophie: That sounds cool. Did you ever work on any big projects during your studies?`  

`Brian: They werenâ€™t exactly big projects. Most of them were smaller scale. But it was a great learning experience. It's fascinating to me how we all take different paths but BLANK in the same tech world, right?`  

`Sophie: Absolutely! Let's grab a coffee sometime and chat more!`
