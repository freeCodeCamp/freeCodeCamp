<!-- (Audio) Brian: It was more hands-on, and I loved every bit of it. -->

# --description--

Regular verbs that end with `e` have a simple rule for conjugating in the past tense. You just need to add a `d` to the end of the verb. 

This rule helps to keep the pronunciation clear and avoids the addition of an extra syllable that could complicate the word's pronunciation.

For example:

`live` becomes `lived`.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`It was more hands-on, and I BLANK every bit of it.`

## --blanks--

`loved`

### --feedback--

To form the simple past, add `d` to the base form of the verb, `love`.
