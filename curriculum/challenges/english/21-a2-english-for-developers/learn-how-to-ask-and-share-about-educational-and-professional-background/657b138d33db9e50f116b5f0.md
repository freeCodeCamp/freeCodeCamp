# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does Anna ask about the candidate's educational background in computer science?

## --answers--

`Are you educated in computer science?`

### --feedback--

`Are you` is present tense, but Anna's question is about the candidate's past education.

---

`Do you study computer science?`

### --feedback--

`Do you study` is present tense. The question is about past education.

---

`Were you educated in computer science?`

---

`Have you studied computer science?`

### --feedback--

`Have you studied` is a different form, asking if they have ever studied it at any time. `Were you educated` specifically asks about formal education in the past.
