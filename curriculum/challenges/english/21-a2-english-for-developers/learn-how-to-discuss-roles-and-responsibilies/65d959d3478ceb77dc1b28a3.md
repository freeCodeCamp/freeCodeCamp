<!-- (Audio) Bob: Well, I have to attend team meetings and provide progress reports, but I don't have to work overtime unless it's an urgent situation. -->

# --description--

`Work overtime` means to work more hours than the usual work schedule. For example, `I usually work overtime during project deadlines` means working extra hours to meet project deadlines.

`Unless` is used to talk about an exception to something or introduce a condition that makes the previous statement not true. It means `if it's not the case`. For example, `I walk to work unless it rains` means I walk to work if it doesn't rain.

`Urgent` means something that is very important and needs immediate attention. For example, `The project is urgent` means the project needs to be completed right away.

In a negative sentence, `don't/doesn't have to` expresses that something is not a requirement. For example, `I don't have to work late` means working late is not required.
