<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I also don't want to neglect my health, so two months ago I started jogging regularly. -->

# --description--

The verb `jog` means to run at a slow, steady pace. The word `start` can be followed by a verb ending in `-ing` (like `jogging`) or with `to` followed by the base form of the verb (like `to jog`). This shows the beginning of an action.

Adverbs describe how actions are done. They are often formed by adding `-ly` to adjectives. For example, `regular` is an adjective that means usual or done often. When you add `-ly`, it becomes `regularly`, an adverb that means doing something in a usual or frequent manner.

Examples:

`He has a regular exercise schedule.`, or `He exercises regularly.`
