<!-- (Audio) Tom: She sounds like a great person. I should have a chat with her sometime. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is Tom implying about the person?

## --answers--

She is not nice.

### --feedback--

Tom actually suggests the opposite by saying `a great person`.

---

He has never met her.

### --feedback--

While this might be true, it doesn't directly address Tom's implication about her being great.

---

She seems to be a very good person.

---

She is loud.

### --feedback--

`Sounds like a great person` refers to the quality of her character, not the volume of her voice.
