<!-- (Audio) Maria: He makes sure the company's data and facilities are secure, monitors access controls, and conducts investigations when needed. -->

# --description--

The genitive case (`'s`) is used to show ownership or a relationship between two things.

For singular nouns, you add `'s` to the end of the noun to show possession. For example, `the cat's toy` means the toy that belongs to the cat.

For plural nouns that already end in `-s`, you just add an `'` at the end. For example, `the teachers' lounge` means the lounge for teachers.

A `facility` is a place where a particular activity happens, like a factory, office, or school.

## --sentence--

`facilities`
