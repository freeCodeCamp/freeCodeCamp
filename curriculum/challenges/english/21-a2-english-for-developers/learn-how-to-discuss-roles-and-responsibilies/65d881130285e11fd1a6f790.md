<!-- (Audio) Maria: No problem. If you ever need any security tips, you really must talk to Jeff. -->

# --description--

The word `must` is used to express a strong necessity or obligation. It indicates that something is very important to do.

The phrases `talk to` and `talk with` both refer to the act of speaking to someone, but there is a slight difference in usage. `Talk to` can imply a one-way communication, where one person is speaking and the other is listening, while `talk with` suggests a conversation where both people are equally involved in speaking and listening.

For example, `I need to talk with my friend about our plans` suggests a discussion, while `I need to talk to my brother about his homework` might imply giving instructions or advice.
