<!-- (Audio) Bob: I also can’t disclose sensitive information to anyone outside of the company. -->

# --description--

`Can't` is a contraction for `cannot`. It means you are not able to do something or it's not allowed. For example, `I can't swim` means I am unable to swim. It's different from `mustn't` which means you're prohibited do something.

To `disclose` means to share information that is supposed to be kept secret. For example, `You shouldn't disclose your password to anyone` means you should not share your password with others because it is private.

`Sensitive information` refers to important details that must be kept secret and safe. It includes things like personal data, passwords, or company secrets that should not be shared with everyone to protect privacy and security.
