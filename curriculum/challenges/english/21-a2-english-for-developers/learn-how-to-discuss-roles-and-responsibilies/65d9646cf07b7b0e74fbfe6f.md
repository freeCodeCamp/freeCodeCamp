<!-- (Audio) Brian: Sophie, how do you manage your work-life balance and your responsibilities outside of the office? -->

# --description--

To `manage` means to control or be in charge of something, like how you organize your time or tasks. For example, `I manage my schedule by planning ahead` means I control my schedule through planning.

`Work-life balance` is about making sure you have time for your job and also for people and things like family, friends, and hobbies. The `-` between `work` and `life` links the two words to show they are connected in the concept of balancing career and personal life.

For example, `Achieving a good work-life balance is important for happiness` means it's important to have a balanced amount of work and personal time for overall well-being.
