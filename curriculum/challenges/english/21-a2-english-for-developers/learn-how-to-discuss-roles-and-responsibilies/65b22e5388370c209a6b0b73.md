<!-- (Audio) Sophie: No, I haven’t seen her yet. What can you tell me about her? -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

What does Sophie mean?

## --answers--

She saw Anna a long time ago.

### --feedback--

Sophie's use of the Present Perfect tense negative indicates the action hasn't happened, not that it happened in the past.

---

She has not seen Anna up to this moment.

---

She sees Anna regularly.

### --feedback--

Sophie's statement indicates the absence of a meeting, not a regular meeting.

---

She will never see Anna.

### --feedback--

The use of `yet` implies the possibility of seeing Anna in the future, not that it will never happen.
