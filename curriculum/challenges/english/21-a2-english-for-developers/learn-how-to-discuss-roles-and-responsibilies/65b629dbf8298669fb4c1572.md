<!-- (Audio) Bob: She makes sure we follow the rules and that everyone is happy. -->

# --description--

The word `everyone`  means every person in a group. `Every-` is used when talking about all things or people in a group, one by one.

It's important to note that `everyone` sounds like it's talking about many people, but you use it with a singular verb. This is similar to other words starting with `every-` like `everything` and `everybody`.

For example, you say `Everyone goes to the party`, `Everything is right` or `Everybody works hard`.

`Make sure` means to check or ensure something is correct before moving on. For example, `You make sure the code runs` means you check the code to be certain it has no errors and can run properly.

`Follow the rules` means to do what the rules say. If there is a rule that says `use camelCase for variable names`, to `follow the rules` means you name your variables like `myVariable` instead of `myBLANKvariable`.
