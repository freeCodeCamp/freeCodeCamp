<!-- (Audio) Alice: She seems to take her work very seriously. -->

# --description--

The word `seriously` is an adverb that means doing something with a lot of thought and attention, showing that it's important to you. It's the adverb form of the adjective `serious`.

For example, when `someone is serious about a project`, they think it's very important. If `they work seriously`, it means they work with a lot of effort and care.

To make an adverb from an adjective, you often add `-ly` to the end of the adjective. When an adjective ends in `y`, you need to change the `y` to `i` and add `-ly`. For instance, `happy` becomes `happily`.
