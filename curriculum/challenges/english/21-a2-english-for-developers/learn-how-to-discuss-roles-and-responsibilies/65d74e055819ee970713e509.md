<!-- (Audio) Maria: You mustn't share your access codes or passwords with anyone. -->

# --description--

 When you need to express something that is prohibited or a strong suggestion against doing something, you can use `mustn't` (contraction of `must not`) to form a negative sentence.

For example, `You mustn't touch the wet paint` means it's very important not to touch the paint because it's wet.

`Anyone` is used when you're talking about all people in a general way and usually in questions or negative sentences:

`Don't tell anyone` means don't tell any person.

`Someone` is used when you're talking about an unspecified person in a positive sentence:

`I need someone to help me` means you need an unspecified person to help.
