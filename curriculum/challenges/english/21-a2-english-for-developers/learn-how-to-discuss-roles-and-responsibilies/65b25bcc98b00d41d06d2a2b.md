<!-- (Audio) Bob: You’ll recognize her right away. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Bob mean?

## --answers--

You will know who she is as soon as you see her.

---

You will not know who she is.

### --feedback--

Bob's statement suggests the opposite, that you will indeed know her when you see her.

---

You will meet her for the first time.

### --feedback--

To `recognize` someone means you have seen or known them before, not that it's the first meeting.

---

You will forget who she is.

### --feedback--

`Recognizing` someone means remembering them, not forgetting.
