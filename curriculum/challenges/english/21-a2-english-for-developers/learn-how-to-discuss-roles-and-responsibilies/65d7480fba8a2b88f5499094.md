<!-- (Audio) Tom: I got this message saying I must talk with Jeff from the Security department. -->

# --description--

The word `must` is used to express a strong necessity or obligation. It is followed by a verb to show something that is very important or necessary to do.

It's similar to `have to`, but `must` is often used when the obligation comes from the speaker or is internal, while `have to` is often used for external obligations or rules.

Examples:

`You must study for the test` means the speaker thinks it's very important for you to study for the test.

`I have to go to work at 8 AM` means the speaker needs to work at 8 AM because of a job schedule.

`Talk with` means to have a conversation or discussion with someone. For example, `I need to talk with my teacher about the homework` means I need to have a conversation with my teacher concerning the homework.
