<!-- (Audio) Alice: She's fair and supportive, always willing to help and answer questions. -->

# --description--

`Fair` means treating people equally and making decisions that are right and just. For example, `The teacher is fair when grading tests` means the teacher treats all students the same way when marking their work.

`Supportive` is an adjective which describes someone who gives help and encouragement. It comes from the verb `support`, which means to give help or assistance to someone or something.

Examples:

`My coach is very supportive during training` means the coach helps and encourages the team a lot.

`My friends support me when I have problems` means your friends help and encourage you during difficult times.

`Be willing to` means being ready and not hesitant to do something. After `be willing to`, you use a base verb to describe the action someone is ready to take. For instance, `He is willing to learn new programming languages` means he is open and ready to start learning new languages.
