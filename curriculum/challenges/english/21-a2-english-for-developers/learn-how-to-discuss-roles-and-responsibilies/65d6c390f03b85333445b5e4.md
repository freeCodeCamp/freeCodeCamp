# --description--

The phrase `have to` is used to talk about things that are necessary or required. It is similar to `must`, but `must` is stronger and used for more important rules or personal feelings.

After `have to`, you use a base verb to explain what action is necessary. For example, `You have to wear a helmet` means wearing a helmet is necessary for safety.

`Though` is a word used to show a small contrast or surprise in a sentence. It's similar to `but`. For example, `It's cold, though it's sunny` means it's surprising the weather is cold because it's also sunny.
