<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Sophie, what motivates you to work on open-source software projects in your free time? -->

# --description--

`Open-source` projects are when the source code is made freely available and can be modified or shared. For example, the Firefox web browser is an open-source project, meaning anyone can see how it was made and can help improve it.

`To work on` something, especially with the preposition `on`, indicates putting effort into a task or project over time. Like when you say, `I'm working on a new app,` it means you're in the process of developing it.
