## --sentence--

`Tom: Hey, Sophie, what motivates you to BLANK open-source software projects in your free time?`

`Sophie: Well, I love contributing to open-source projects! I really like the BLANK community and collaboration. It's incredible how people from around the world come together to create something amazing.`

`Tom: Yeah. I checked out some open-source projects, but I admit that I have problems with the BLANK time it can take to contribute. Sometimes, it can be so time-consuming.`

`Sophie: I understand, Tom. It can be a BLANK. But I can't stand seeing this great software being private. Open source is all about transparency and accessibility, and that's something I truly believe in.`

`Tom: Yeah, BLANK is a strong motivator for many developers. For me, I like the idea of practicing my skills and getting recognition for my contributions. It's a fantastic way to show what you're capable of.`

`Sophie: Also, when software becomes obsolete because it's BLANK maintained, there isn't much you can do to save it. With open source, there's always a chance for continuous improvement.`

`Tom: That's true. The sustainability of open-source projects is something I'm growing to appreciate more. Thanks for sharing your BLANK. I think I'll see if I can find a project to dedicate some spare time to.`
