An `obsession` is when you can't stop thinking about something because you like it so much. For example, if you love playing a certain video game every day, you might say, `This game is my obsession!`

`Drones` are small flying machines that can be controlled by a remote. People use them for taking photos from the sky, racing, or just for fun. For example, `I flew my drone over the park to get a great view from above.`
