<!-- (Audio) Alice: I hear you, Tom. Sitting in meetings for hours can be discouraging. -->

# --description--

`Encourage` means to give someone support or confidence to do something. For example, when your friend says, `You can solve this coding problem!` they are encouraging you. 

`Discourage` is the opposite; it means to make someone feel less confident or less likely to do something. If that friend says, `That programming language is too hard for beginners,` it might discourage you from learning it.

`Discouraging` describes something that makes you feel discouraged. Like, `Finding a bug in your code after hours of work can be discouraging.`

`Encouraging` is when something gives you courage or hope. For example, `Getting your first program to run is very encouraging.`
