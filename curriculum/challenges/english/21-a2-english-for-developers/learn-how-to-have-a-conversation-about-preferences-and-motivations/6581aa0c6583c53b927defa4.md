<!-- (Audio) Tom: That does sound frustrating, Alice. Repeating the same tasks over and over can be demotivating. -->

# --description--

The phrase `over and over` means doing the same thing many times, which can make tasks feel boring or pointless. For example, if you have to check the same type of code `over and over` for errors, it might start to feel monotonous.

Tom is expressing sympathy for Alice's situation by talking about how doing tasks repeatedly can affect motivation. 

Listen to Tom's statement and fill in the missing words, focusing on the feelings described and the repetition of tasks.
