<!-- (Audio) Brian:Dealing with many tight deadlines and feeling like I'm rushing to complete tasks. -->

# --description--

The phrase `tight deadlines` means you have to finish your work very soon. 

`Tight` here means there is not much time. `Deadlines` are the days or times you must finish your work by. When deadlines are tight, you need to work fast and well to finish everything on time.
