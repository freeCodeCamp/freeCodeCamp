<!-- (Audio) Tom: It's exhausting, and it feels like I'm constantly running without knowing where I'm going. -->

# --description--

When something is `exhausting`, it makes you feel very tired, like after a long day of work or exercise. Imagine playing soccer all day and feeling so tired afterward; you'd say, `Playing soccer all day is exhausting`.

`Constantly` means happening all the time or very often, without stopping. If you do your homework every day without fail, you can say, `I'm constantly doing these tasks`.
