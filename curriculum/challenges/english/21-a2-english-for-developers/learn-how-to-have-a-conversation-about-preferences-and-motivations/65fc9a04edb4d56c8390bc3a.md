<!-- (Audio) Maria: Yeah, technical glitches are complicated and there's not much we can do other than try to solve them. -->

# --description--

A `glitch` is a small problem that stops something from working right. Like when a game on your phone stops working suddenly, that's a glitch. To talk about more than one, we say `glitches`, like `My computer had a few glitches`. 

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Yeah, technical BLANK are complicated and there's not much we can do other than BLANK to solve them.`

## --blanks--

`glitches`

### --feedback--

`try`
