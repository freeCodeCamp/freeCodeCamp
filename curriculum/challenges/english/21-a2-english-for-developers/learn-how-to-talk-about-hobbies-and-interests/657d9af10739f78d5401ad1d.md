<!-- (Audio) Bob: For nearly a decade now. It started as a hobby, but it has become a significant part of my life. -->

# --description--

The word `as` is often used to describe the role, function, or manner of something. In the context of activities, `as` can indicate that something is done in a particular way or style, or for enjoyment rather than professionally, as in Bob's sentence, `It started as a hobby`.

# --question--

## --text--

Select the sentence that correctly uses `as`:

## --answers--

`This is a small blanket. It takes as a small space in your bag.`

---

`They play music as a band, performing in local cafes.`

---

`He writes as his job at the newspaper, focusing on sports.`

### --feedback--

This sentence misuses `as`. It should be `He writes for his job at the newspaper, focusing on sports.`

---

`I use my phone as to make calls.`

### --feedback--

This sentence is incorrect because `as` is not needed with `to` in this context. The correct sentence should be: `I use my phone to make calls`.
