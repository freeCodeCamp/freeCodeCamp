<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Hey, Tom! Have I told you I'm a huge sci-fi fan? I'm even part of an amazing fandom. -->

# --description--

In this dialogue, Sarah uses `Have I told you` to ask Tom in an engaging way if she has previously mentioned something about herself. 

Using `Have I told you` is a way to connect the past with the present, as if Sarah is trying to recall if she has shared her passion for sci-fi with Tom before. 

This phrase is a great example of how the *Present Perfect Tense* is used to talk about actions that occurred at an unspecified time before now.
