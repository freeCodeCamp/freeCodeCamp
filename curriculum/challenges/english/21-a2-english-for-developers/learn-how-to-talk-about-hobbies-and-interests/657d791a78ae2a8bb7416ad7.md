<!-- (Audio) Bob: For nearly a decade now. It started as a hobby, but it has become a significant part of my life. -->

# --description--

The verb `become` is normally associated with transforming into something that was not the same way originally. When you say `I became addicted to coffee when I started working at the company` (`became` is the past form of `become`), you imply that you weren't addicted to coffee before joining the company, but now you are.

With the *Present Perfect* tense, you use the form `become` after `have` or `has`, meaning it is a change that still influences you. For example: `I've become interested in video games at age 20.`

Complete the sentence with the right combination of the verbs `have` and `become`, conjugated accordingly.
