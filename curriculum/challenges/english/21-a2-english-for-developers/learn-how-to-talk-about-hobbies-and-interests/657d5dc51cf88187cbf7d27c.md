# --description--

The *Present Perfect Tense* is formed using the auxiliary verb `have` or `has` with the past participle of a verb. It's used to talk about actions or situations from the past that still matter now. 

To form it, use `have` with `I`, `you`, `we`, `they`, and `has` with `he`, `she`, `it`. Add the past participle next.

For regular verbs, it's usually the verb plus `-ed` (like `walked`), but for irregular verbs, it can vary (like `seen` from `see`). For example:

 `I have walked to the park` or `She has seen the movie`. This tense is helpful in discussing past actions with current relevance.
