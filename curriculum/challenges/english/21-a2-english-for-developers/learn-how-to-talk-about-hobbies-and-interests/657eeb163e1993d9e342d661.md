<!-- (Audio) James: I didn't know you were interested in this. -->

# --description--

In the dialogue, James says `I didn't know you were interested in this` to refer to the fact that he had no idea Sarah liked going to comic conventions. Sarah had just commented about this, so James uses `this` in his sentence to refer to a thing that had just been mentioned. It is another usage you have for the word `this`, to refer to something mentioned a bit before.
