# --questions--

## --text--

Choose the correct phrase that conveys a similar meaning.

## --answers--

`I'm indifferent to it.`

### --feedback--

---

`I'm excited about it.`

---

`I'm avoiding it.`

### --feedback--

The phrase expresses eagerness, not avoidance. Avoidance would suggest a desire to stay away from it, contrary to the meaning of looking forward to something.

---

`I'm unaware of it.`

### --feedback--

The phrase expresses anticipation, not unawareness. Unawareness would suggest a lack of knowledge about it, which does not align with the positive anticipation expressed.
