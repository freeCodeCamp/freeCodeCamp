<!-- (Audio) Linda: Would you like to go cycling with me one of these days? -->

`One of these days` is a phrase you use when you talk about something you plan to do soon, but you haven't decided exactly when. It's like saying "sometime soon" or "in the near future." For example, if you say, `One of these days, I'll visit Paris`, it means you want to visit Paris and hope to do it sometime soon, but you don't know the exact day yet.
