<!-- (Audio) Maria: How long have you been into photography? -->

# --description--

In the beginning of the dialogue, Maria says `Are you into photography?` to ask if Bob likes photography. Now that she knows he does, she asks `How long have you been into photography?` to know the amount of time that has passed since he started enjoying it. 

Since the question is about duration from the past up until the present, you use the *Present Perfect* tense. 

Also, remember that the form of the verb `to be` for the Present Perfect is `been`. For example: `I have been in a traffic jam for an hour. I can't wait to go home.`

When you want to ask questions related to duration, start the question with `How long`. Examples: `How long is this movie?`, `How long have you two been married?`

Fill in the blanks with the appropriate words.
