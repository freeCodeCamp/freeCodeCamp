<!-- (Audio) Bob: For nearly a decade now. It started as a hobby, but it has become a significant part of my life. -->

# --description--

`Near` means close in distance or time, while `nearly` is used to indicate that something is almost, but not completely finished. 

For example, if you're `near` finishing a project, you're close to completing it. If you've `nearly` finished, you're almost done but not quite there yet.

The expression `for nearly a decade now` combines `nearly` with `a decade` (ten years) to describe a long period of time, almost but not quite reaching ten years. It's used to talk about something that has been happening or continuing for just about ten years.
