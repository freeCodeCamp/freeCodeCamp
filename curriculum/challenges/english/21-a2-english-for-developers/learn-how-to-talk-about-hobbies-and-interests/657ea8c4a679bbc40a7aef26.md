<!-- (Audio) Jake: Sure! I'd love to. -->

# --description--

`Sure` is a friendly way to say `yes` or agree to something. It's like saying `definitely` or `of course`.

  When someone invites you to do something and you want to say yes in a casual and positive way, you can use `Sure`. It shows that you are happy to accept the invitation.
