<!-- (Audio) James: Hey, I noticed you have a huge collection of action figures on that shelf behind you. -->

# --description--

An `action figure` is a small toy that looks like a character from a movie, comic book, or video game. People often collect them because they like the characters or stories.

For example, if you say, `My brother got a new action figure for his birthday`, it means he received a toy that represents a character he probably likes.
