<!-- (Audio) James: Hey, I noticed you have a huge collection of action figures on that shelf behind you. Are you a collector? -->

# --description--

When you talk about objects or things in a specific place, you often use the word `that` to point them out. For example, `that shelf` means the shelf you are talking about or focusing on at the moment.

The word `shelf` is a noun that refers to a flat, horizontal surface used for holding items. When you talk about more than one `shelf`, you should change the ending to make it plural by replacing `f` with `ves`, so it becomes `shelves`. For example, `one shelf`, `two shelves`.
