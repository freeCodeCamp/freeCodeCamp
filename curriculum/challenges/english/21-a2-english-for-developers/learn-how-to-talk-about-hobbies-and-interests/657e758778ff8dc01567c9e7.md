<!-- (Audio) Jake: That's great! How long have you been into cycling? -->

Remember, to form questions in the Present Perfect Tense, the sentence structure must be rearranged by changing the position of the subject and the auxiliary verb `have`. The verb in its participle form (in this case, `been`) is places after the subject. For example: `How long have you been a doctor?`
