# --description--

The word `most` is used to describe the highest degree or largest part of something. It's often used when comparing three or more things or situations. 
For example, if you have three tasks - Task A, Task B, and Task C, and Task A takes more time than the others, you can say, `Task A takes the most time.`

Or in the sentence `I spend most of my time coding`, `most` indicates that coding takes up the largest part of the time compared to other activities.

In the context of Sophie's dialogue, when she says she likes to work on the `most important` tasks first, she means she chooses to do the tasks that are the highest in importance compared to the others.

Examples:

- `The most challenging part of my job is solving complex problems.`
- `I like to drink coffee the most in the morning.`
