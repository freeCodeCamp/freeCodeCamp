# --description--

A regular, 8-hour working day in the United States usually goes from `9 AM` (nine in the morning, or simply `9`) to `5 PM` (five in the afternoon, or just `5`). It is common to represent this saying you have a `9-to-5 job`, meaning your working hours start at 9 and end at 5 every day.
