<!-- (audio) Sophie: So Jake! How's it to work in security? Do you deal with any danger?

Jake: No, not that much. In the morning, I have to check the security cameras to make sure they are working properly. I have to monitor the entrances and exits at all times. -->


# --description--

The phrase `not that much` is used to indicate a small amount or degree, often in response to a question about quantity or frequency. 
For example, `Do you travel for work?` – `Not that much.`

On the other hand, `at all times` means always or continuously, indicating something that happens without interruption. 
For instance, `Security guards must be alert at all times.`
