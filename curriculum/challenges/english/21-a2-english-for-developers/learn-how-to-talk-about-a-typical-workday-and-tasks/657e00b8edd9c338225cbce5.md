# --description--

Prepositions of time are essential in English to talk about when something happens.

The preposition `in` is used for months, years, centuries, and long periods. For example, `We will update the software in July`, `I started learning coding in 2022`. `I like to work in the morning`.

The preposition `on` is used for days and dates. For example: `Our team meets on Mondays`, `The coding class is on April 10th`, `I finished the task on the last day`.

The preposition `at` is used to specify exact times of the day. For example, `Our meeting is at 9 AM`, `I begin coding at 10 AM`, `We have lunch at 12 PM`.
