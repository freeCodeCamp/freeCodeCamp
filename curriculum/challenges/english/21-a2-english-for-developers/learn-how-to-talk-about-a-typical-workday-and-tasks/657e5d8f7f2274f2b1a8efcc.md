# --description--

`Every` and `any` are often used in sentences but have different meanings.

`Every` is used to talk about all items in a group or category. For example, `Every student must complete the assignment` means all students.

On the other hand, `any` is used in questions or negative sentences to mean one, some, or all. For example, `Can any student answer the question?` means if there is even one student who can answer.
