A `security incident` is an event that may be harmful to the safety or security of a company or organization. For example, `A security incident like a stolen password needs to be reported immediately.`

`Touching hot surfaces can cause harm,` means that touching hot surfaces can lead to injury or damage.

`Harmful` is an adjective used to describe something that can cause harm. It means dangerous or risky in a way that could lead to damage or injury. For example:
