<!-- (Audio) James: I'm using special tools to see where we might have problems, and then I have to fix them. -->

# --description--

James uses the present continuous tense to talk about actions happening at the moment of speaking or around it. 

The present continuous is formed with the present tense of the verb `to be` (`am/is/are`) followed by the `-ing` form of the main verb. For example: 

`I am using` in `I am using special tools` shows an action James is currently working on. 

This tense is often used for actions that are temporary or in progress. Some more examples include: 

`She is studying for the interview` (she is currently focused on studying).

`They are working on a new project` (they are presently involved in the project).

`He is walking to the station` (he is in the process of walking to the station).
