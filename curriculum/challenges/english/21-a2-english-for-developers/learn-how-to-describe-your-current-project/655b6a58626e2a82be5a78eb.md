<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I'm helping our team learn how to stay safe online. We're taking some lessons and practicing what to do if someone tries to steal our identity. -->

# --description--

To `steal` means to take something that doesn't belong to you without permission. For example:

`Some people try to steal our data` means that there are people that try to take personal data without the owner's permission.

`Identity` refers to who a person is, including their name, date of birth, and other personal information. For example: 

`Protecting your identity online is important` means keeping your personal information safe on the internet.
