<!-- (Audio) Mark: It's a nice experience so far, but we're doing more tests to make sure everything works. -->

# --description--

When you want to `make sure` something works, you try to do it with special care to confirm the result in the end. For example:

- `We have to make sure the code is running.` - This means you'll be specially careful with the code to confirm it runs well.

- `Please make sure that you order the correct color.` - Here, you are being asked to confirm the color you want before ordering something.
