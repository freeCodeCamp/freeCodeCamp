<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Pictures can be great to explain things. We are not using pictures, but it's definitely fun to work with data like this. -->

# --description--

We say something is `definite` when we are certain about it. 

When you add the suffix `-ly`, `definite` becomes an adverb, `definitely`, which means being sure about something or being confident about it. 

It's often used to emphasize what the speaker believes is true or likely to be true. For example:

- `I can definitely see why this is important.` - Emphasizing that the importance is expected to be clear.

- `She will definitely finish the project on time.` - Showing confidence in her completing the project.
