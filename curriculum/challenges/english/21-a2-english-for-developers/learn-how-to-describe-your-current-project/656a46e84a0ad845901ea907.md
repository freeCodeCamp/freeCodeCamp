<!-- (Audio) Amy: Yes, I am. I'm experimenting with video interviews and interactive infographics to make the content more engaging for our readers. -->

# --description--

To `experiment` means to try new ideas or methods. 

An `interview` is a conversation where someone asks questions to get information. 

An `infographic` is a visual image like a chart or diagram used to represent information.

`Readers` are people who read, especially those who read a particular publication.

For example:

- `We experiment with new teaching methods.` - Trying new ideas.

- `The journalist conducts interviews with her readers.` - Conversation for information.

- `They use infographics to explain data.` - Visual images for information.
