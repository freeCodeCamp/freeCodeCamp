<!-- (Audio) Bob: I'm supposed to figure out if our current practices are robust enough to protect sensitive information. -->

# --description--

`Robust` means strong or powerful. For example:

`A robust system can handle many users.` 

`Enough` means as much as is necessary. For example:

`Do we have enough chairs?` 

Together, `robust enough` means being strong or effective to the necessary degree. For example, this sentence asks if the password is strong enough to stop hackers:

`Is the password robust enough to prevent hacking?`
