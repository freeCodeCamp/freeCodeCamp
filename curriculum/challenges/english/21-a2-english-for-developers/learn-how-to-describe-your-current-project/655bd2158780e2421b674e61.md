<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Hi Bob! I'm looking at customer data to find patterns -->

# --description--

`Data` means information, especially facts or numbers collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making. 

There are different types of data, like `quantitative data`, which is about numbers (like how many people visit a store), and `qualitative data`, which is about descriptions (like what people think about a product). 

`Customer data` is specific information about customers, like their buying habits or preferences. 

For example, a store might collect `data` on what times of day customers visit most often, or which products are most popular.
