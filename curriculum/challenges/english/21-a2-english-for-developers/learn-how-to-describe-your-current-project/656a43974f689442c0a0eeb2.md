<!-- (Audio) Amy: That sounds like a good idea, Brian. I'm currently working on a series of blog posts about tech trends. -->

# --description--

`Currently` comes from `current` meaning happening now. Adding `-ly` turns an adjective into an adverb. For example:

`She is currently reading a book` (She is reading a book now)

`Trends` are popular styles or ideas that many people are talking about or doing. The word `trend` in the singular becomes `trends` in the plural. For example:

`One current trend is using eco-friendly products` (singular)

`She writes about fashion trends` (plural)

`Tech trends` refer to popular developments in technology.
