<!-- (Audio) Amy: That sounds like a good idea, Brian. I'm currently working on a series of blog posts about tech trends. -->

# --description--

`Currently` comes from `current` meaning happening now. Adding `-ly` turns an adjective into an adverb.

For example:

`She is currently reading a book` - She is reading a book now.

`Trends` are popular styles or ideas that many people are talking about or doing. The word `trend` in the singular becomes `trends` in the plural.

For example:

- `One current trend is using eco-friendly products.` - Singular.

- `She writes about fashion trends.` - Plural.

`Tech trends` refer to popular developments in technology.
