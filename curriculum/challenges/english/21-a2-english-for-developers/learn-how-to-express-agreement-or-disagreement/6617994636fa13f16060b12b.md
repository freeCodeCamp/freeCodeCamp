<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I still think we should dedicate more time to the web app, but I see where you're coming from, Brian. I think we can try giving equal priority for a while. -->

# --description--

This task helps you understand and use `still`, `dedicate`, and `priority` in a professional setting.

`Still` is used to indicate that something is continuing or hasn't changed. For example, `I still need to finish that report` means the task is ongoing.

To `dedicate` means to devote time or resources to a particular task or purpose. For instance, `We need to dedicate more staff to customer service` suggests focusing more team members on that area.

`Priority` refers to the importance given to something that needs to be done or dealt with first. Saying `Making our website user-friendly is a priority` means that it's an important focus.

Understanding these terms is key for discussing work plans and responsibilities.
