<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I'm not sure I agree with that, Brian. The web app needs attention. It has more users. Prioritizing the web app makes more sense given its larger user base. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Sarah think they need to prioritize the web app?

## --answers--

Because it has a larger user base and needs more attention

---

Because the web app is newer than the mobile app

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Sarah's reason for prioritizing the web app is its larger user base, not its newness.

---

Because the web app is less expensive to develop

### --feedback--

Sarah's argument is based on user numbers, not development costs.

---

Because they have already spent too much time on the mobile app

### --feedback--

Sarah's focus is on the user base size, not the time spent on the mobile app.
