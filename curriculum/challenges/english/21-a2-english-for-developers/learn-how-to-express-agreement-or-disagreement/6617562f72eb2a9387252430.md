<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I respectfully disagree, Bob. I believe the color scheme needs some changes. Bob: Ah, I see what you mean. The color scheme doesn't match our brand's image. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

How does Bob react to Sophie's suggestion about changing the color scheme?

## --answers--

He agrees and acknowledges that the color scheme doesn't match the brand's image.

---

He strongly disagrees and insists on keeping the current color scheme.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Bob's response shows understanding and agreement with Sophie's point, not strong disagreement.

---

He is indifferent and suggests discussing it later.

### --feedback--

Bob's statement doesn't indicate indifference; he actively engages with Sophie's point about the color scheme.

Bob's response `I see what you mean` shows understanding, not confusion.
