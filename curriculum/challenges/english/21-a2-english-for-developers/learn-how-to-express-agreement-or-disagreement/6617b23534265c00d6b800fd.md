<!-- (Audio) Bob: I'm sorry, but I beg to differ. -->

# --description--

`Beg to differ` is a polite way of saying that you disagree with someone. It's like saying, `I have a different opinion.` This phrase is often used to disagree without sounding rude or too direct.

For example, in a meeting, if someone says, `This is the best course of action.` And you don't agree, you could say, `I beg to differ, there might be other options we haven't considered.`

Using `beg to differ` shows that you respect the other person's opinion but have a different viewpoint. It's a good way to express disagreement in a respectful manner, especially in professional settings.
