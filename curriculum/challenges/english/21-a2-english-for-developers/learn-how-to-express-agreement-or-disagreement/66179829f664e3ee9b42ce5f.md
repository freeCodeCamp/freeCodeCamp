<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I'm not sure I agree with that, Brian. The web app needs attention. It has more users. Prioritizing the web app makes more sense given its larger user base. Brian: Well, here's what I think we could do. Why don't we allocate resources to both platforms equally? We could give equal priority to both the web app and the mobile app. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Does Brian agree with Sarah's proposal to prioritize the web app?

## --answers--

Yes, he completely agrees and wants to focus only on the web app

### --feedback--

This choice is incorrect. Brian suggests a compromise by equally allocating resources to both platforms, not solely focusing on the web app.

---

No, he disagrees and suggests focusing only on the mobile app instead

### --feedback--

Brian's response is not a direct disagreement; he proposes a balanced approach rather than focusing solely on the mobile app.

---

He partially agrees with Sarah, but he proposes a compromise by equally prioritizing both platforms

---

He agrees but suggests postponing the decision for later

### --feedback--

Brian's suggestion is immediate and specific about equal resource allocation, not postponing the decision.
