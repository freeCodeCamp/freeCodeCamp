<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I still think we should dedicate more time to the web app, but I see where you're coming from, Brian. -->

# --description--

When someone says `I see where you're coming from`, it means they understand another person's opinion or point of view. It's like saying, `I understand your thoughts or feelings.`

For example, if a friend says, `I don't like going out in the rain.` And you reply, `I see where you're coming from.` It means you understand why they don't like it, maybe because getting wet is unpleasant.

In a work situation, understanding where someone is `coming from` helps in discussions. If a colleague says, `We should check our emails more often.` And you respond, `I see where you're coming from.` It shows you understand their reason, like staying updated with important information.
