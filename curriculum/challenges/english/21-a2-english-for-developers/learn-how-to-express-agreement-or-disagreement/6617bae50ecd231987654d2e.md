<!-- (Audio) Bob: Well, I think everyone is more used to Agile, right? OK, I give in. We can proceed with the Agile approach. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

What influenced Bob to agree with Sarah's suggestion about using Agile?

## --answers--

He realized Agile is more cost-effective than other methods.

### --feedback--

This choice is incorrect. Bob's agreement is based on the team's familiarity with Agile, not cost-effectiveness.

---

He agreed because the team is more familiar and comfortable with Agile.

---

He was convinced by Sarah's argument that Agile is more innovative.

### --feedback--

Bob's statement doesn't mention innovation as the reason for his agreement; it's about the team's comfort with Agile.

---

Sarah's strong belief in Agile's effectiveness convinced him.

### --feedback--

While Sarah's belief may have been a factor, Bob specifically mentions the team's familiarity with Agile as his reason.
