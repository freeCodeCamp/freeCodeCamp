<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Variables help you store information in your code, like names, numbers, and more. You can use the equals symbol to assign values to them. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

How do variables work in programming?

## --answers--

Variables organize code and are accessed through specific keywords.

### --feedback--

Variables store information, not just organize code, and the method mentioned doesn't specifically involve using the equals symbol.

---

Variables track changes in values using mathematical symbols.

### --feedback--

This isn't right because it incorrectly suggests that variables track changes by themselves and emphasizes mathematical symbols, not assignment.

---

Variables control program flow and use commands to modify data.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect as it misrepresents variables as controlling program flow, which is not their primary function.

---

Variables store information and use the equals symbol to assign values.
