<!-- (Audio) Sarah: No problem, Tom. To understand them, you can look at their names and comments. Comments explain that function's purpose. Tom: Got it. So that means I should read the function names and comments to know what those functions do. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does `that` refer to in Tom's statement?

## --answers--

That he should rewrite the functions

### --feedback--

This is incorrect. Tom's use of `that` does not imply rewriting but understanding the existing functions as explained by Sarah.

---

That he should read the function names and comments to understand what the functions do

---

That he should ignore the comments

### --feedback--

Incorrect. Tom acknowledges the importance of reading comments, not ignoring them, as they help explain the function's purpose.

---

That he needs to learn programming from scratch

### --feedback--

This is not suggested in any part of the conversation. Tom is discussing how to better understand functions, not learning programming from the beginning.
