<!-- (Audio) Jake: Ah, I see. So this means I should pick the data type that matches the information I want to work with. -->

# --description--

This task focuses on the relative pronoun `that`. It is used to introduce a clause providing more details about a noun.

A clause is a part of a sentence that contains at least a subject and a verb. It can express a complete idea or add extra information to the main sentence.

The pronoun `that` helps specify or define something more clearly, connecting it to a description or a necessary detail.

For example, `She read the book that won the Pulitzer Prize last year.` In this sentence, `that won the Pulitzer Prize last year` is a relative clause introduced by `that`. The clause describes or specifies the book, helping to distinguish it from other books. Here, `that` acts as a relative pronoun connecting the clause to the noun `book`, and it describes which particular book she read.
