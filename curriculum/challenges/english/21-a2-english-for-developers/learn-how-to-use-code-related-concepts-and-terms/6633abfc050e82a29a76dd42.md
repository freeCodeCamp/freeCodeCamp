# --description--

`Can` is used to show that something is possible or someone is capable of doing something, while `can't` is a contraction of `cannot`, indicating that something is impossible or someone is incapable of doing something. Both words should be followed by the base form of verbs.

Examples:

`I can swim.` (showing ability)

`I can't swim.` (showing inability or lack of ability)
