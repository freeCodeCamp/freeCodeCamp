# --description--

The connector `so` is used to introduce a result or effect related to what has been said. It often shows a cause-and-effect relationship between two parts of a sentence.

For example, `It was raining, so we canceled the picnic.` This shows that the picnic was canceled because of the rain.

`She is late to work, so she misses the meeting.`

### --feedback--

The use of `so` suggests a consequence, but the tenses are mismatched. It should be: `She is late to work, so she will miss the meeting.`

---

`It started raining, so we took shelter.`

---

`He likes to read books, so he buys a lamp.`

### --feedback--

This sentence does not correctly use `so` because buying a lamp is not a direct result of liking to read books. A better use might be: `He likes to read at night, so he bought a lamp.`
