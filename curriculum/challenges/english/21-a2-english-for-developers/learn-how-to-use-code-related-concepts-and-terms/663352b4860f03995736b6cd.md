<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Variables help you store information in your code, like names, numbers, and more. -->

# --description--

`Store information` means to keep or save data in a specific location, usually in a variable. Variables are like containers in your code that hold information, such as numbers, text, or other types of data. You can think of them as named storage spots where you can access the `stored information` later in your code.

For example, `int age = 30;` Here, the variable `age` stores the number 30.

The word `like` is used as a preposition to give examples or to compare similar things.

For instance, if you say, `I love fruits like apples and oranges.` You are using `like` to give examples of the type of fruits you love, suggesting that there might be more fruits on that list.
