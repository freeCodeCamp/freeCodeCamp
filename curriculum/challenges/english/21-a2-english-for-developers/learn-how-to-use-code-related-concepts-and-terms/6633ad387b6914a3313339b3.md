<!-- (Audio) Tom: I see. So that means I can change the values in these variables, but I can't touch the values in these constants. -->

`Touch` often means to come into physical contact with something. It can also be used metaphorically in contexts like programming, where it means to alter or affect something.

`These` is used to refer to specific items that are close to the speaker or are being actively discussed.
