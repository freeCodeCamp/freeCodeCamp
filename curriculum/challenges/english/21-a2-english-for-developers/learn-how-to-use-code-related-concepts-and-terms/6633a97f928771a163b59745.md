<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Think of variables as containers you can fill and empty, and constants as locked boxes that keep the same contents. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence accurately describes the difference between variables and constants as explained by Sophie?

## --answers--

Variables are flexible storage units, while constants are secure storage units that cannot be altered.

### --feedback--

This option, while somewhat accurate, doesn't fully capture the metaphor of filling and emptying versus locked boxes that Sophie used.

---

Variables can store multiple types of data at once, whereas constants can only store one type.

### --feedback--

This statement is misleading because it focuses on the types of data rather than how the data can be altered or remains fixed, which is the main point of Sophie's explanation.

---

Variables act as containers that can be filled and emptied, while constants act as locked boxes that keep unchanged contents.

---

Variables are always changing, and constants are never used more than once.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect as it suggests constants are never used more than once, which is not true. They are used repeatedly but their values do not change.
