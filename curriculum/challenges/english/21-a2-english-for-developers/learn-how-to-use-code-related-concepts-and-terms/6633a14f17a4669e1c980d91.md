<!-- (Audio) Tom: Thanks, Sophie. I'm also using many constants in my project. But what's the difference between variables and constants? -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Tom want to know?

## --answers--

How to define constants in his project

### --feedback--

This option isn't correct. Tom is asking about the distinction between two concepts, not how to define constants.

---

Why he should use constants instead of variables

### --feedback--

This isn't correct because Tom's question is about understanding the differences, not the reasons for using one over the other.

---

The difference between variables and constants

---

Which is better to use in his project: variables or constants

### --feedback--

This option is misleading. Tom is looking for clarification on the differences, not advice on which is better to use.
