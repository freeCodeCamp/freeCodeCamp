<!-- REVIEW -->

# --description--

This is a review of the entire dialogue you just studied.

# --instructions--

Place the following phrases in the correct spot:

`values`, `equals symbol`, `containers`, `constants`, `contents`, and `variables`.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Tom: Hey, Sophie. I'm working on a project that uses many BLANK. I'm not sure how to manage them all.`

`Sophie: Variables help you store information in your code, like names, numbers, and more. You can use the BLANK to assign values to them.`

`Tom: Thanks, Sophie. I'm also using many BLANK in my project. But what's the difference between variables and constants?`

`Sophie: Great question, Tom. Variables can change their BLANK, but constants stay the same. Think of variables as BLANK that you can fill and empty, and constants as locked boxes that keep the same BLANK.`

`Tom: I see. So that means I can change the values in these variables, but I can't touch the values in these constants.`
