<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Great question, Tom. Variables can change their values, but constants stay the same. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the difference between variables and constants according to Sophie?

## --answers--

Variables' values can be different, but constants remain unchanged.

---

Variables and constants are both used to store values permanently.

### --feedback--

This option isn't correct because constants are permanent, but variables can change.

---

Constants can change their values just like variables.

### --feedback--

This isn't accurate. Constants do not change their valuesâ€”they stay the same, unlike variables.

---

Variables are used less frequently than constants in programming.

### --feedback--

The frequency of use isn't discussed, and Sophie's statement focuses on usage rather than their functional difference.
