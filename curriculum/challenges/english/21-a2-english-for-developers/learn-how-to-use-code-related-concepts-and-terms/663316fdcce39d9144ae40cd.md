<!-- (Audio) Tom: Got it. So that means I should read the function names and comments to know what these functions do. -->

# --description--

The word `what` can be used to introduce a clause. It typically introduces noun clauses, providing more information about a noun or acting as a part of a statement.

A noun clause is a clause that functions as a noun within a larger sentence. It typically includes a subject and a verb, and can act as the subject, object, or complement in a sentence.

For example, in the sentence `She doesn't know what to buy`, `what to buy` is a clause where `what` stands for the thing that she needs to decide on purchasing.

Another example is `Tell me what you heard.` `What you heard` is the clause, with `what` explaining the specific things that were heard, acting as the object of the verb `heard`.

`These` is a plural demonstrative pronoun refers to specific items previously mentioned or understood from the context.
