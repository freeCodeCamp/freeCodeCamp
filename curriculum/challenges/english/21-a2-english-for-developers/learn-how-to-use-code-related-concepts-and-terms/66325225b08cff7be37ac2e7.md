# --description--

Relative pronouns like `who`, `whom`, `which`, and `that` are used to connect relative clauses to a noun or pronoun.

`Who` and `whom` refer to people. The difference is `who` is the subject of a verb, while `whom` is used as the object of a verb or preposition.

`Which` is used for specific things or animals, and `that` can be used for people, things, or animals in defining clauses.

Examples:

`The programmer who wrote this code is brilliant.` (`who` refers to the programmer)

`The artist whom we met at the gallery is internationally recognized.` (`whom` refers to the artist)

`The tool that you lent me was useful.` (`that` refers to the tool)

`The book, which I bought yesterday, is already a bestseller.` (`which` refers to the book)
