<!-- (Audio) Tom: I see. So that means I can change the values in these variables, but I can't change the values in these constants. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Based on Tom's explanation, which scenario best illustrates the difference between variables and constants in a practical situation?

## --answers--

Variables are like the volume of a radio, which you can adjust anytime, whereas constants are like a sealed CD, whose songs cannot be altered.

---

Variables and constants both need regular updates to stay effective.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect because constants do not change or need updates; they remain the same, unlike variables which can be updated.

---

You can pause or play music on a radio, just as you can switch variables and constants on and off.

### --feedback--

This isn't right because constants, unlike variables, cannot be 'switched off' or altered; they are permanent once set.

---

Tom can only use constants during certain times of the day, while variables can be used anytime.

### --feedback--

This statement is misleading as it suggests that the use of constants is time-restricted, which isn't true. Constants, like variables, do not have usage restrictions based on time but are defined by their unchangeable nature.
