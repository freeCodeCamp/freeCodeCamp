# --description--

The word `difference` refers to the way in which two or more things are not the same. It highlights the distinct characteristics or qualities between items or concepts.

For example, if you look at an apple and an orange, the `difference` includes their color, taste, and texture.

The preposition `between` is often used in the phrase `difference between` to compare two things or discuss the contrasts that exist when comparing two things.
