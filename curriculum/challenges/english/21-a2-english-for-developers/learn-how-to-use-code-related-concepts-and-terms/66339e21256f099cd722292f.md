# --description--

A `constant` in programming is similar to a variable, but once it is assigned a value, that value cannot be changed. `Constants` are used when you have values that you know will not need to be modified throughout the program. They are often written in uppercase letters to distinguish them from variables.

For example, `const PI = 3.14;` In many programming languages, `const` is used to declare a constant. Here, `PI` is a `constant` with assigned value `3.14`.
