<!-- (Audio) Tom: I see many functions in our code, but I'm not sure what each of these does. -->

# --description--

Direct questions are straightforward inquiries that clearly ask for specific information. They typically invert the subject and the verb, like in `Are you sure?` This form is commonly used in everyday conversations, especially when quick and clear answers are needed.

Indirect questions or statements, on the other hand, are more polite and less direct. They do not invert the subject and the verb and often begin with phrases like `I was wondering` or `Could you tell me`. For example, instead of asking `Where do you live?` you might say, `Could you tell me where you live?` This makes the question sound less abrupt and more polite, which is particularly useful in formal settings or when you're speaking with someone you don't know well.

Examples:

Direct question: `What time is it?` (inversion of verb `is` and subject `it`)

Indirect statement: `Please tell me what time it is.` (no inversion)
