# --description--

`Object-oriented programming` (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of `objects`, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

A common example of `OOP` is creating a class in a programming language like Java or Python. This class defines the structure of objects, including their attributes and methods. For instance, a `Car` class might include attributes like `color` and `model`, and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`.

The term `oriented` in this context means aligned or directed towards a particular purpose or principle.

For example, freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum is described as `project-oriented` because it is structured around completing projects, which means the teaching method is focused on practical application rather than just theoretical knowledge.
