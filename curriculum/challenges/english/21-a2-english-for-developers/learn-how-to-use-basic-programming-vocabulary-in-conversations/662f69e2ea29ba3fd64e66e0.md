<!-- (Audio) Tom: That helps a lot! Can you recommend a good book for me to learn more about it? Sarah: Of course! I have a book on OOP's principles. I'll send you the title. It has helped many people I know. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Sarah recommend that specific book on OOP's principles to Tom?

## --answers--

Because it's the only book she has on the subject

### --feedback--

This option is misleading; Sarah recommends the book not because it's her only one, but because it has proven helpful to others.

---

Because it includes the most recent research on OOP

### --feedback--

While recent research might be beneficial, Sarah specifically mentions the book's usefulness with people she knows, not its recency.

---

Because it has been helpful to many people she knows

---

Because she wrote the book herself

### --feedback--

There is no indication that Sarah authored the book; her recommendation is based on its effectiveness for others.
