# --description--

`Involve` means to include as a necessary part.

The verb `involve` is used to indicate that something includes or contains as a necessary part or component. In various contexts, it can mean that a person or thing is actively engaged in something or that a situation requires something as a part of the process.

For example, `The job involves using computers every day.` This means using computers is a necessary part of the job.

The term `blueprint` originally refers to a detailed technical drawing or plan for building something. In a broader sense, and especially in programming, a `blueprint` is a guide or a model that shows how to construct or design something.
