<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I've learned about variables, data types, and even conditional statements in many languages. -->

# --description--

Learn `variables`, `data types` and `conditional statements` in programming.

A `variable` is like a box where you can store information. This information can be numbers, text, or other types of data. You can change what's in the box, which is why it's called a `variable` â€“ because it can vary. For example, in `x = 5`, `x` temporarily holds the value 5.

A `data type` is a classification that specifies the type of data that a `variable` can hold. Common `data types` include integers (whole numbers), floats (numbers with a decimal), strings (text), and booleans (true or false). For example, if `age = 21`, the `data type` is an integer.

A `conditional statement` is a command that tells the computer to do something only if a specific condition is true. It's like making a decision in real life based on a certain situation. Common `conditional statements` are `if-else` statements. For example, `if (temperature > 20) {console.log("It's warm outside!");}` is a `conditional statement` that executes `console.log("It's warm outside!")` if the temperature is above 20 degrees.
