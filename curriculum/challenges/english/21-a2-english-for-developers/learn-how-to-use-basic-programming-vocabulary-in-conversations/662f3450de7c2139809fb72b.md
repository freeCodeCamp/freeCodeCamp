# --questions--

## --text--

Which situation is an appropriate use of `no worries`?

## --answers--

Your friend apologizes for being late, and you respond, `No worries!`

---

You are giving directions to someone who looks lost and say, `No worries, turn left here.`

### --feedback--

While meant to be reassuring, `no worries` doesn't make sense in this context as it is typically not used to give directions but rather to dismiss concerns.

---

A coworker asks for a report urgently and you reply, `No worries`, without providing the report.

### --feedback--

This use might imply indifference or dismissal without addressing the coworker's urgent need, which is not appropriate.

---

You are warning someone about a serious risk and say, `No worries, but be careful.`

### --feedback--

Using `no worries` in a situation involving serious risk could undermine the seriousness of the warning.
