`Tom: Hey, Sarah, I was reading about BLANK programming on the internet. It's a new concept for me.`

`Sarah: Object-oriented programming is used in many BLANK. How much do you know about it so far?`

`Tom: Not much, really. I understand that there are classes and methods, but I've never used them in my code.`

`Sarah: No worries. Object-oriented programming is a fundamental concept in many languages. It involves BLANK, which are like blueprints for BLANK, and inside the classes, you find the class's BLANK, which are actions those objects can perform.`

`Tom: That helps a lot. Can you recommend a good book for me to learn more about it?`

`Sarah: Of course. I have a book on OOP's BLANK. I'll send you the title. It has helped many people I know.`
