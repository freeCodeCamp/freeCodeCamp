# --description--

A `loop` is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. `Loops` are used to run the same code multiple times efficiently. Common types of `loops` include `for` loops and `while` loops. 

For example, `for loop`: `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { /* code to be executed */ }`

In the example, the code inside the braces `{ }` is executed repeatedly until the condition is no longer true.

# --question--

## --text--

What does `loop` mean in a programming context?

## --answers--

It's a command to exit a program.

### --feedback--

A `loop` is not used to exit a program but to repeat a sequence of instructions.

---

It's a structure that repeats code until a certain condition is met.

---

It is a type of data storage.

### --feedback--

`Loops` do not store data; they control the flow of execution by repeating operations.

---

It's a method to rename variables automatically.

### --feedback--

`Loops` do not rename variables; they execute a block of code multiple times under specific conditions.
