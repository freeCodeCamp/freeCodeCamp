<!-- (Audio) Brian: That's great to hear. You know, I have a question about Python. Can you help me with that? -->

# --description--

`Python` is a popular programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. It allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. 

The expression `Can you help me with` is a polite way to ask for assistance with a specific issue or task. For example, `Can you help me with my homework?`
