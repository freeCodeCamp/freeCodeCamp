# --description--

A `plugin` is a component that adds a specific feature to an existing computer program. When a program supports `plugins`, it enables customization. 
In the context of an IDE, `plugins` can provide additional functionality, like new tools for coding, debugging, or enhancing the user interface.

For example, a code formatter in an IDE is often a `plugin`.
