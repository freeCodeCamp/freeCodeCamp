<!-- (Audio) Sarah: It involves classes, which are like blueprints for objects, and, inside the classes, you find the classes' methods, which are actions those objects can perform. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which statement best describes object-oriented programming as explained by Sarah?

## --answers--

Object-oriented programming is about creating a sequence of commands that the computer follows one after another.

### --feedback--

This statement describes procedural programming, not object-oriented programming which focuses on classes and objects.

---

Object-oriented programming primarily involves using standard templates for web development.

### --feedback--

This option incorrectly describes object-oriented programming as it does not mention the creation and interaction of objects, which are central to OOP.

---

Object-oriented programming uses classes as blueprints to create objects, and methods within these classes define what actions the objects can perform.

---

Object-oriented programming is a simple method that involves copying existing codes into new programs.

### --feedback--

This description is incorrect as object-oriented programming is not about copying code but designing systems through objects and classes.
