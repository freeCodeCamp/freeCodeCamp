# --description--

Countable nouns are things you can count. They can be one, two, three, or more. You can use numbers, and quantifiers such as `many`, `a few` or `several` to describe countable nouns. For example, apple: you can have `one apple`, `two apples` or `many apples`.

Uncountable nouns are things you cannot count one by one. They usually do not change to show more than one. You don't use numbers directly, instead, use quantifiers like `much`, `a little`, `some` to describe uncountable nouns. For example, water: you cannot say `one water` or `two waters`. You can say `much water`, `some water`.
