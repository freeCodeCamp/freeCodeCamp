# --description--

A `function` is a set of instructions that perform a specific task. `Functions` can make code more organized, reusable, and easier to read. For example, a `function` might calculate the sum of two numbers or display a message to the user.

Think of a `function` as a small machine in a factory; you give it some input, it does something with that input, and then it gives you an output.
