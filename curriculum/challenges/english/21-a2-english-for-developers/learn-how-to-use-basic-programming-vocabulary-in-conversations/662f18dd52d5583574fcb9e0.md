# --description--

When asking and answering questions about quantity, it's important to use `much` and `many` consistently. `Much` is used with uncountable nouns, while `many` is used with countable nouns. In a conversation, the question and answer should match in using either `much` or `many`.

Examples:

Question: `How much time do you have?` Answer: `Not much.`

Question: `How many books do you own?` Answer: `Not many.`
