<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Well, I was investigating the code when I saw that the problem might be related to the recent updates. I tried rolling back to the previous version, but it didn't fix the issue. -->

# --description--

Understanding how different steps in solving a problem are connected is key.

# --questions--

## --text--

How do Sarah's two actions of looking at the code and going back to an older version connect?

## --answers--

Looking was to find the problem; going back was for a new change.

### --feedback--

Both steps were to solve the issue, not for new changes.

---

Both were ways to try and solve the same problem.

---

Looking was for a report; going back was to solve the problem.

### --feedback--

Both steps were aimed at fixing the issue, not reporting.

---

Looking was her first try, and going back was not linked.

### --feedback--

Going back was related to her first step and part of trying to solve the issue.
