# --description--

`Strange` means unusual or not expected. It's like finding something different from what you normally see. For example: `A strange sound in a car might mean a problem.`

An `error` is a mistake, especially one that stops something from working correctly. For instance: `An error in a code means there is a mistake that needs fixing.`
