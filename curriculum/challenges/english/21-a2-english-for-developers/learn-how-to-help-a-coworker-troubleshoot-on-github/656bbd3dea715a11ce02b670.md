# --description--

In coding, especially when using version control systems like `Git`, `push` means to upload changes from a local repository to a remote one. 

The past tense `pushed` indicates that this action has already been completed. 

For example, `He pushed his code to the GitHub repository` means he uploaded his recent code changes to GitHub.
