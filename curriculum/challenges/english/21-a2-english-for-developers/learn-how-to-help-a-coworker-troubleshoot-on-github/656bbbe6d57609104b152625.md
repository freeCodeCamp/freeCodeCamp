<!-- (Audio) Bob: Hey, Sarah. I was checking the branch we worked on yesterday when I saw a problem. I think we should open an issue on GitHub. -->

# --description--

Bob's statement uses the past continuous tense `I was checking` to describe an action that was ongoing in the past. 

You can create sentences in the past continuous by combining the ver to be in the past `was` or `were` + `verb + ing`.

He also uses the modal verb `should` to suggest a course of action.
