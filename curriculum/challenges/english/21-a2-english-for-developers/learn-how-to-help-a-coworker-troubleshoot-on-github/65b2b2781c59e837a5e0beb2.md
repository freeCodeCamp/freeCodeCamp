AUDIO REFERENCE: 
Maria: "Tom, I saw that you’ve fixed the issue on GitHub. Great job!"
-->

# --description--

`Already` suggests something has happened sooner than expected, while `never` means something has not happened at any time in the past.

# --question--

## --text--

Has Tom already fixed the issue on GitHub?

## --answers--

`Yes, he has just finished it now`

### --feedback--

`Just` means that something was finished a few moments ago. That is not the case.

---

`No, he has never fixed an issue`

### --feedback--

`Never` implies that he has not fixed any issue ever, which contradicts Maria's statement.

---

`Yes, he has already fixed it`

---

`No, he always fixes issues quickly`

### --feedback--

`Always` is not suitable here as the question is about a specific issue, not general habits.
