<!-- (Audio) Tom: I see. We might have to talk to the team to see if they can help us. -->

# --description--

Modal verbs like `might` and `can` are used to express possibility and ability. 

`Might` is used for something that could happen or be true, like saying, `It might rain today`. 

`Can` is used to talk about someone's ability to do something, like, `She can speak three languages`. Let’s practice using these words in sentences.
