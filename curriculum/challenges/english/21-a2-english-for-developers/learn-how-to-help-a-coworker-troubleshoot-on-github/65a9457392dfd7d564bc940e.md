# --question--

## --text--

What happened when Sarah went back to the older version, and what does this mean for the problem?

## --answers--

It didn't solve the problem, showing the older version is not the issue.

---

It caused more problems, showing the current version is the issue.

### --feedback--

Sarah said that going back didn’t solve the issue, not that it caused more problems.

---

It solved the problem, meaning the new updates were the problem.

### --feedback--

The line clearly states that going back did not solve the issue.

---

It changed nothing, suggesting the problem might be somewhere else.

While it didn't solve the issue, this doesn't directly suggest the problem is elsewhere.
