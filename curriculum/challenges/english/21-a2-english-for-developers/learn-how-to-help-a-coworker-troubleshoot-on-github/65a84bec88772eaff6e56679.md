# --description--

Imagine you're working on a project and have been trying different solutions over time. To express this ongoing effort, you can use the present perfect tense. This tense connects past actions to the present moment.

The present perfect tense is formed using the auxiliary verb `have` or `has` followed by the past participle of the main verb. For example, `I have been working on this for a long time` or `he has worked on this for a long time`.

Let's practice using the present perfect tense to talk about actions that started in the past and are still relevant now.
