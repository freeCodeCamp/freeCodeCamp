AUDIO REFERENCE:
Jake: Hey. You're Sarah, right? I'm Jake, from Security. I'm here to give you your access card.
Sarah: Thanks, Jake. Is it contactless?
-->

# --description--

Sarah's question `Is it contactless?` refers to a specific item mentioned by Jake. The word `contactless` usually describes a type of technology where you don't need to physically touch or swipe something. For example, tapping a card against a scanner instead of inserting it. Notice that `Is it` is used to ask for specific information about that item.
