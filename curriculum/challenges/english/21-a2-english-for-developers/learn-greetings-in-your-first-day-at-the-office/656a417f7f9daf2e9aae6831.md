# --description--

Identify how articles change the context of a sentence. Articles, like `the` and `a`, can change the meaning of a sentence. `The` talks about something specific. `A` talks about something in general.

For Example:
`Tom is a graphic designer in our company` means there are many graphic designers and Tom is one of them.
`Tom is the graphic designer of our company` means there is only one person in the company matching this description (that's Tom).

Notice that, after `graphic designer`, there are details that made the situation more specific. In this company, there's only one person that could fit the profile - Tom.
