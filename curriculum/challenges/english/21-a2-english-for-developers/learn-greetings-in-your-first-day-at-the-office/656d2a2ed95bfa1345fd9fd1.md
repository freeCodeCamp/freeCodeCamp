<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Jake: No, it isn't. It's the good-old swipe at the door.
-->

# --description--

When Jake says `swipe at the door`, he means you have to move or `swipe` the access card close to a special reader at the door to open it.

# --questions--

## --text--

What should Sarah do with the card at the door?

## --answers--

`It is the door.`

### --feedback--

This doesn't indicate an action.

---

`Swipe it`

---

`good-old door.`

### --feedback--

`Good-old` describes familiarity, but doesn't indicate an action.

---

`No, it isn't`

### --feedback--

This is a negation and not related to what to do with the card.
