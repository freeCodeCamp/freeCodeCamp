# --description--

A `desk` is often the central part of one's workspace, especially in an office setting. People typically use it to set up their computers, write, read, and do other work-related tasks.

# --question--

## --text--

What is a common activity people might do with their desk at the start of a workday?

## --answers--

Water it like a plant

### --feedback--

Desks are not plants. They don't need water to grow. Try it again!

---

Organize and tidy it

### --feedback--

To `organize` means to arrange things in a structured manner or specific order. `Tidy up` means to make something neat and orderly. Both these actions are commonly done to a workspace or desk to prepare for tasks. Well done!

---

Cook food on it

### --feedback--

Desks are for working, not for cooking. They aren't heat-resistant like stovetops. Try it again!

---

Wear it like clothing

### --feedback--

Desks are furniture items, not wearable objects. You can't put on a desk like a shirt or pants. Try it again!
