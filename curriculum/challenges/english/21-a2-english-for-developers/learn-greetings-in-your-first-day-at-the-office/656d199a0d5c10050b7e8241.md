# --description--

Being `kind` means being friendly, generous, and considerate. It's a positive adjective you use to describe someone who shows goodness or compassion to others.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does Brian describe Sophie?

## --answers--

She is never kind.

### --feedback--

Brian is giving a positive description of Sophie, not a negative one.

She is a kind.

### --feedback--

The word `a` isn't needed before `kind`. It's not grammatically correct in this context.

She is a little kind.

### --feedback--

Brian is emphasizing how kind Sophie is, not downplaying it.
