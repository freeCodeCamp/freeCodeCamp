AUDIO REFERENCE:
Sarah: Thanks, Jake. Is it contactless?
Jake: No, it isn't. It's the good-old swipe at the door.
-->

# --description--

Jake provides an answer using `it isn't`, which is a contraction of `it is not`. It's a way to negate or say `no` to a statement or question. Contractions are a way to combine words for more fluid speech. For example:

`Is the software updated?`
`No, it isn't (it is not) updated.`

Jake also uses `it's`, the contraction for `it is`, when talking about the swipe card system. Let's see how well you understand these in the context of the dialogue.
