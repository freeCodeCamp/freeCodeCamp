# --description--

When talking about devices or tools, `this` and `that` help you show which one.

# --question--

## --text--

Pick the sentence that uses `this` and `that` correctly.

## --answers--

`This mouse here works well, but that one over there doesn't.`

### --feedback--

Correct! `This` is for the mouse close by, and `that` for the one farther away.

---

`That is my phone on this table, but this is my charger in that room.`

### --feedback--

The sentence structure is awkward. Normally, `this` and `that` are not used in this manner, and the words `room` and `table` make the locations confusing.

---

`That are the wires we need.`

### --feedback--

`Wires` is plural, so the correct form should be `these are,` not `that are`.

---

`This app on my phone, and that games on my computer.`

### --feedback--

The sentence is incomplete. Additionally, `games` is plural, so `those games` would be correct.
