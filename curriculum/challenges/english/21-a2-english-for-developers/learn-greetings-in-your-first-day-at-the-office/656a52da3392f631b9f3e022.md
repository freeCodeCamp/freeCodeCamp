# --description--

In workplaces, especially in offices, there's a focus on ergonomics and health. One popular discussion is about the benefits of standing instead of sitting continuously. `Stand up` refers to the action of rising from a sitting position, while `sitting` means being in a position where one's weight is supported by one's buttocks rather than one's feet.
