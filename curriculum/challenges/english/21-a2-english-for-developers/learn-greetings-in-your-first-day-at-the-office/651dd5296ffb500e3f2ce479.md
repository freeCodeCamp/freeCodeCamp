# --description--

Contractions are commonly used to make speech sound more natural and fluent. `You're` is a contraction of `you are`. This contraction is a combination of the pronoun `you` and the verb `are`, which is part of the verb `to be`.

The verb `to be` is irregular. When conjugated with `you`, it becomes `are`. For example, `You are an English learner`.

`Are` can be used in the present affirmative to make a statement or ask a question. This is a typical way to confirm someone's role or identity.
