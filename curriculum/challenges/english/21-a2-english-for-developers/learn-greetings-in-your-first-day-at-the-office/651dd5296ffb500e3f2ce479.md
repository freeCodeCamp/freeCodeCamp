# --description--

In English, contractions are commonly used to make speech sound more natural and fluent. `You're` is a contraction of `you are`. 

This contraction is a combination of the pronoun `you` and the verb `are`, which is part of the verb `to be`. `Are` is used here in the present affirmative to make a statement or ask a question. This is a typical way to confirm someone's role or identity in English.

In the audio, `you're` is used, which is a contraction of `you are`. The verb `to be` is irregular. When conjugated with `you`, it becomes `are`, as in `You are an English learner.` Here, `you're` expresses the same meaning.
