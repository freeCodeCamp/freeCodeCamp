<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I recommend that we start by defining coding standards for different programming languages we use. -->

# --description--

`Coding standards` are like rules for writing computer code. Think of it as agreeing on how to build a brick model, so everyone uses the same colors and steps. This makes it easier for everyone to understand and work together.
