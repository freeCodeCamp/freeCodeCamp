<!-- (Audio) Sophie: I've been working on it for a while, and I may need a fresh pair of eyes to look at the code. -->

# --description--

Sophie implies, or suggests without directly stating, that she needs help with her coding problem. To 'imply' something means to suggest it in an indirect way. For example, saying 'It's getting late' can imply that it's time to leave, without saying it directly.

# --questions--

### --feedback--

Asking for a fresh pair of eyes implies she thinks the code could benefit from changes.
