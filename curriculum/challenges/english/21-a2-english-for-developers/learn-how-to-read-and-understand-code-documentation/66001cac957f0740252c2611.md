<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Next, you should look for any examples that demonstrate how to use these parameters in practice. Examples can show you how to set options correctly and what effect they have on the code. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

According to Sarah, why are examples important?

## --answers--

They show how to set options correctly and the effect they have on the code.

---

They provide a history of how the code was developed.

### --feedback--

Sarah emphasizes practical application, showing how to use parameters and their effects, rather than discussing the historical development of the code.

---

They list all possible errors in the code.

### --feedback--

Sarah highlights examples for understanding correct usage and effects, not specifically for listing potential errors.

---

They offer alternative ways to write the same code.

### --feedback--

The focus is on demonstrating correct use and understanding effects of parameters, not on presenting multiple coding approaches.
