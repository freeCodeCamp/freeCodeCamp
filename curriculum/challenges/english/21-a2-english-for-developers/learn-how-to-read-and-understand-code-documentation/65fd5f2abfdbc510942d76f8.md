<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Don't worry. When you're faced with extensive documentation, the first thing you should do is check for a table of contents or an index. It can help you find the specific information you're looking for. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

Why does Sarah suggest that the first thing Tom should do with extensive documentation is to check for a table of contents or an index?

## --answers--

Because it will help him memorize the entire documentation

### --feedback--

The purpose of checking the table of contents or index isn't memorization but efficient navigation.

---

To help him find the specific information he needs more quickly

---

Because it's a standard practice to read everything in order

### --feedback--

The suggestion isn’t about reading everything in order but about finding specific information efficiently.

---

To evaluate the quality of the documentation

### --feedback--

The focus of Sarah's advice is on efficient navigation, not on evaluating the documentation's quality.
