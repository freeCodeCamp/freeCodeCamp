# --description--

Developers often use `once` to indicate the timing of tasks within their workflow. It means `as soon as` or `when`.

For example, `Once you receive the client's feedback, update the project documentation.` This means that updating the documentation should begin immediately after receiving feedback, showing the sequence of actions in a project's lifecycle.
