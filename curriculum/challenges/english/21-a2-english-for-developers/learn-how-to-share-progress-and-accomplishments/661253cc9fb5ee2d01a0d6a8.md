`To address` means to deal with or handle a problem or challenge. In technology, for instance, you might say, `We need to address the bugs in our software.` meaning you need to find and fix the bugs.

`Concerns` are worries, problems, or issues that someone has. In a customer support context, a `concern` might be a difficulty a user is facing with a product. For example, `The main concern of our users is the app's loading speed.`
