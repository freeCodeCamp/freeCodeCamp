<!-- (Audio) Brian: It seems pretty solid now. -->

# --description--

The expression `It seems pretty solid now` indicates the current status or quality of a project, common in professional and technical discussions.

When something is described as `pretty solid`, it means it is very good, reliable, or strong in quality. It's a way of saying that something is dependable and performs well.

For example, if someone says, `The plan for the weekend is pretty solid`, they mean that the plan is well-thought-out, reliable, and likely to be successful or enjoyable.
