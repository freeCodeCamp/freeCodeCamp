<!-- (Audio) Brian: Great idea. To write comments, you simply need to use double slashes to start a comment. -->

# --description--

In this task, you'll learn the difference between `simple` and `simply`, and understand what `double` and `slashes` mean.

`Simple` is an adjective meaning easy or not complicated, like `a simple task`. `Simply` is an adverb, meaning in a simple manner, like `doing something simply`.

`Double` means two of something. And `slashes` are the `/` symbols used in writing. You add `es` to make `slash` plural because words ending in `sh` form their plurals by adding `es,` like in `dishes` or `brushes`.

# --fillInTheBlank--
