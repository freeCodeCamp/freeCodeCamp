# --description--

The word `so` is a connector used to show cause and effect or to explain the reason for something. In technology and programming, `so` often connects the problem or situation with the solution or outcome.

# --questions--

## --text--

Choose the sentence where `so` is used correctly to connect a cause and an effect in a tech context.

## --answers--

`The program crashed, so we must reboot the computer.`

---

`We wrote the code, so but it didn't compile.`

### --feedback--

The word `so` is used incorrectly here. `But` should not be used after `so.` It should be either `The code didn't compile, so we rewrote it,` or `We wrote the code, but it didn't compile.`

---

`The server is online, so therefore we can't connect.`

### --feedback--

The use of `so` and `therefore` together is redundant. It should be either `The server is online, so we can connect` or `The server is online; therefore, we can connect.`

---

`We need more data, so we can ignore the results.`

### --feedback--

This sentence does not logically connect cause and effect. A better use of `so` would be, `We need more data, so we will perform more tests.`
