# --description--

When a noun ending in `y` becomes plural, the `y` often changes to `ies.` This rule is particularly useful in technology contexts where certain terms frequently end in `y.`

# --questions--

## --text--

How do you form the plural of nouns ending in `y`?

## --answers--

By changing `y` to `ys`

### --feedback--

This is not the usual rule. Generally, `y` changes to `ies` for plurals, as in `query` to `queries.`

---

By adding `s`

### --feedback--

For most nouns ending in `y,` simply adding `s` is not correct. For example, `directory` becomes `directories,` not `directorys.`

---

By changing `y` to `ies`

---

By removing `y`

### --feedback--

Removing the `y` is not the correct way to form plurals. The `y` usually changes to `ies` in plurals, like `binary` to `binaries.`
