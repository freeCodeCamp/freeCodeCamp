<!-- (Audio) Brian: You should list the project dependencies so that anyone who wants to work on it knows what they need. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

Why does Brian recommend listing the project dependencies?

## --answers--

To make the project look more complex

### --feedback--

Listing dependencies is not about making the project look complex, but about providing necessary information for collaborators.

---

To help with the budget planning

### --feedback--

While important, budget planning is not the reason mentioned here. Brian's focus is on informing potential collaborators.

---

To let anyone who wants to work on the project knows what they need

---

To keep track of the coding progress

### --feedback--

Tracking coding progress is important, but the reason Brian gives is to inform people who want to work on the project about what they will need.
