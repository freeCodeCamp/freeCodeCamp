<!-- (Audio) Brian: Good question. When you make changes, you should use descriptive commit messages. -->

# --description--

`Changes` in this context means modifications or edits made in the code.

`Descriptive` means giving details about how something looks, feels, sounds, smells, or tastes. It is an adjective used to provide more information about a noun, making the description more vivid and clear. For example, in the sentence `she wears a beautiful dress`, the word `beautiful` is `descriptive` because it tells listeners more about the dress.

A `message` is a piece of information or communication that someone sends to another person. It can be written, spoken, or even sent through email or text.
