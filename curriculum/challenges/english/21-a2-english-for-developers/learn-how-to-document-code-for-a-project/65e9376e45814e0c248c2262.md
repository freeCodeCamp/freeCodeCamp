<!-- (Audio) Brian: You can also explain what certain functions do, and clarify the purpose of variables. -->

# --description--

`Clarify` means to make something clear or easier to understand. You might `clarify` a complex idea by explaining it in simpler terms. For example, `He clarified the instructions by providing a step-by-step guide.`

`Function` in programming is a set of instructions that perform a specific task. For instance, `The "calculateTotal" function adds up all the prices.`

A `variable` is like a box where you can store information or data in a computer program. You can change what's inside the box, or `variable`, as your program runs. It's a way to keep track of and use data in your code. For example, `The variable "score" keeps track of the player's points.`
