<!-- (Audio) Alice: Video conferencing tools also made it possible for teams to have face-to-face meetings online. -->

# --description--

`Face-to-face` means you and someone else can see each other directly. It's like having a conversation with a friend or a teacher when you can see their face and they can see yours.

Example: `Even though we are in different countries, we can still have face-to-face meetings online using video conferencing tools.`

# --questions--

## --text--

According to Alice, what kinds of meetings do video conferencing tools allow you to have?

## --answers--

Meetings where people send text messages to each other

### --feedback--

This option involves text messages and doesn't include real-time conversation with video.

---

Meetings where people share documents without speaking

### --feedback--

Sharing documents is part of online collaboration, but it doesn't define a face-to-face meeting.

---

Meetings where people write letters to each other

### --feedback--

Writing letters is a traditional way of communication and not the same as real-time online interaction.

---

Meetings where people talk and see each other through the computer or phone
