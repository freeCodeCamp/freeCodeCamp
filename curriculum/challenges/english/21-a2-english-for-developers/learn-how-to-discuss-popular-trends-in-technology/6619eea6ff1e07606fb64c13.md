<!-- (Audio) Sarah: They may seem complicated, but there are lots of simple videos that can help you understand the basic ideas. -->

# --description--

You use `may` before a verb to say that there is a strong probability that it will happen. Look at the examples: `It is very easy.` (verb `to be` by itself - you are affirming something is very easy). `It may be very easy` (`may` comes before the verb to be - conjugated in the infinitive form without `to` - to say there is a strong probability that something is very easy, but you are not affirming it is).

`Lots of` indicate a great quantity/amount of something. Example: `I have lots of files in my laptop.` (there are many files there).

Listen to what Sarah says and fill in the blank
