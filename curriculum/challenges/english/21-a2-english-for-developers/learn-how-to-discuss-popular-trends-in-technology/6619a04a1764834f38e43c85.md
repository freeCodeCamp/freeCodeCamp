<!-- (Audio) James: That's cool. But what can it do besides calculating things? Sarah: Well, it's not just for one thing. -->

# --description--

When asking Sarah about quantum computers, James wants to know if calculating things is the only purpose they have. Sarah disagrees. She says `Well, it's not just for one thing.` In this context, `just` means the same as `only`, as in `it's not the only thing quantum computers can do`.
In the beginning of the dialogue, James uses `just` to say he heard about quantum computers moments before their conversation. This is another usage for `just`.

# --questions--

## --text--

What conclusion can we get from Sarah's answer?


## --answers--

Quantum computers can do more than simply calculating

---

Quantum computers are a calculation device and that is all they can do

### --feedback--

According to Sarah, they don't serve only for calculating.

---

Quantum computers can't calculate

### --feedback--

According to Sarah they can, but it is not their only purpose.

---

Sometimes, quantum computers produce wrong results

### --feedback--

This has nothing to do with Sarah's answer.
