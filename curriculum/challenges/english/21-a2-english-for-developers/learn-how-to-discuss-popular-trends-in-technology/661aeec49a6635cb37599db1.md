<!-- (Audio) Tom: Alice, what's the deal with biometrics? I keep hearing about facial recognition and fingerprint scanning. -->

# --description--

`Fingerprint scanning` is a technology that looks at the unique patterns on your fingers to identify and verify who you are. It's like your fingers have special marks that are different from everyone else's. When you use `fingerprint scanning`, the system checks these marks to make sure it's really you. Just like `facial recognition`, it is an important technique used by `biometrics`.
