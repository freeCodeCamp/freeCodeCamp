<!-- (Audio) Alice: Well, there are project management tools. They help teams to organize tasks. -->

# --description--

`To help someone to do something` means assisting someone in doing a specific action. It involves giving support or guidance to enable them to complete a task or achieve a goal. Some sentences before, Alice says `It offers flexibility and can help companies gain access to talent from many parts of the world.` Notice that, in this sentence, she does not use `to` before `gain`, since using both the `infinitive` form and the `to + infinitive` are possible.

Listen to the audio and fill in the blanks.
