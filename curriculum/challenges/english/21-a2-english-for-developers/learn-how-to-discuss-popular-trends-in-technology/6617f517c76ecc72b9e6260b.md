How can AI help doctors?

By talking to the patients to calm them down

### --feedback--

Even though it is possible to use AIs to chat, this is not what Tom mentions.

---

By giving instructions to doctors on how to perform surgeries

### --feedback--

It is expected that doctors are already trained to perform surgeries beforehand.

---

By distracting the patients while doctors perform the surgeries

### --feedback--

It is possible to use AI as a means of entertainment, but that is not what Tom mentions.
