<!-- (Audio) Alice: Remote work is likely to remain a big part of our lives. It offers flexibility and can help companies gain access to talent from many parts of the world. -->

# --description--

`Gain access to` means to be able to use something or go somewhere that you couldn't before. It's like being given permission to enter a room or use a computer. In the dialogue, Alice means that companies can now work with talented people of different parts of the world, thanks to remote work.

# --questions--

## --text--

According to Alice, what is helping companies to have talented workers from all the world working for them?

## --answers--

The companies are paying for these workers' travel expenses

### --feedback--

Not exactly. They don't have to travel to another location because of remote work.

---

Seminars and conferences in the company's own country

### --feedback--

Even though these events tend to have people from all over the world, that is not what Alice says.

---

Having branches in these workers' countries

### --feedback--

Multinational companies can do that, but there are other ways to have people from other countries working for you now.
