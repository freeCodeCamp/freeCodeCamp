<!-- (Audio) Alice: During the pandemic, we worked from home with tools like video conference apps and collaboration platforms. -->

# --description--

When you say `no matter`, you're saying that a particular situation or condition doesn't change the outcome or the result. It emphasizes that something will happen or is true regardless of other factors. 

# --questions--

## --text--

In the audio, what does Alice mean when she says `no matter where they are`?

## --answers--

Teams can only work together if they are in the office

### --feedback--

They can work in other places, too, not only in the office.

They can work even if they are in different places

---

They can only work together when they are at home

### --feedback--

Not really. It does not matter where the people are.

---

They can only work together if they are using a collaboration platform

### --feedback--

Not necessarily. There are other ways people can work together from different places.
