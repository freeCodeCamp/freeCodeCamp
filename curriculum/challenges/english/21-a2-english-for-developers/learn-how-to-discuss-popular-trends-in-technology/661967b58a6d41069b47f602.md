<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I know a little. Quantum Computing uses special computers to perform calculations extremely quickly. -->

# --description--

When you use `a little`, you mean the same as `some`, a small quantity or amount. It is the opposite of `a lot`. Example: `I know a little about Chemistry.` (meaning you understand some of it, but you are not necessarily an expert).

`Perform` means to do something, like a task or an action. When you perform, you're showing what you can do or completing a job or activity. When singing a song on a stage, solving a math problem, or playing a game, you are `performing`.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
