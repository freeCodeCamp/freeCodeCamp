<!-- (Audio) James: Is it hard to understand how quantum computers work? Sarah: They may seem complicated, but there are lots of simple videos that can help you understand the basic ideas. -->

# --description--

Remember: if you don't want to affirm something - maybe because you are not 100% sure that it is true - you can soften the sentence by using `may` before the verb. Instead of saying `she is faster than you`, you can say `she may be faster than you`. This makes it sound like a strong probability, not something you know it is correct.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why is James asking Sarah if quantum computers are hard to understand?

## --answers--

Because he wants to buy a quantum computer

### --feedback--

You don't know that for sure. He may want something different.

---

He just wanted a topic so he could talk to Sarah

### --feedback--

If you don't know the context, it is best not to affirm something as being 100% sure.

---

He may be curious about quantum computers and he may want to learn more about them

---

He wants to invent a new medicine or study molecules and drugs

### --feedback--

He may want that, but that is not necessarily true. We can't be 100% sure of that.

## --video-solution--
