<!-- (Audio) James: Wow, that's amazing. Is it hard to understand how quantum computers work? -->

# --description--

When you combine `it is` followed by an adjective (like `hard`, `easy`, `simple` and others), a verb that comes after this combination has to be in the `to + infinitive` form. Example: `It is easy to study for English tests.` (after the adjective, `easy`, you have to use `to` before `study`). In a question, invert `it` and `is`. Example: `Is it simple to learn to play an instrument?`

Listen to the audio and fill in the blanks with the correct words.
