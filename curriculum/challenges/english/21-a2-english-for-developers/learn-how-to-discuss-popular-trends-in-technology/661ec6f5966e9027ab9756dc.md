<!-- (Audio) Alice: For example, they're experimenting with palm vein recognition and even behavioral biometrics, like typing patterns to enhance security. -->

# --description--

`Typing patterns` refers to the unique way you type on a keyboard or device. It includes the speed, rhythm, and specific patterns you use when pressing keys. Each person has their own distinct way of typing.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the relationship between `behavioral biometrics` and `typing patterns` based on the dialogue?

## --answers--

They are unrelated concepts.

### --feedback--

The dialogue suggests a connection between behavioral biometrics and typing patterns.

---

Behavioral biometrics is the same as typing patterns.

### --feedback--

While related, behavioral biometrics encompasses more than just typing patterns.

---

Typing patterns are a part of behavioral biometrics.

---

Palm vein recognition excludes the study of typing patterns.

### --feedback--

Palm vein recognition is mentioned separately and doesn't exclude the study of typing patterns in behavioral biometrics.
