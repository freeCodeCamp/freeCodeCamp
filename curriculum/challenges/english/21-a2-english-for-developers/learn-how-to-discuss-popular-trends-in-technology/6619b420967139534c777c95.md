<!-- (Audio) Sarah: They're useful for studying things like molecules and drugs. -->

# --description--

When you say something is `useful`, you mean it can help you to perform a certain task or activity. Example: `Computers are very useful for calculating things.` As you can see, after `useful`, we have the preposition `for`, meaning any verb that comes after it has to be in the `-ing` form (see the example).

`Molecules` are like tiny building blocks that make up everything. Everything you see and touch is made from molecules. They are groups of two or more atoms together.

`Drugs` are substances that change how our bodies feel or work. There are two kinds: medicine and illegal drugs. People can take drugs as pills, liquids, or in other ways.

Fill in the blanks with the correct word from the dialogue.

---

`studying`

### --feedback--

The act of spending time learning something. Since it is preceded by `for`, it goes in the `-ing` form here.

Groups of two or more atoms together. Very small parts of everything. Use the plural form here.

Substances that can change the way your body acts or feels. They can be legal or illegal. Use the plural form here.
