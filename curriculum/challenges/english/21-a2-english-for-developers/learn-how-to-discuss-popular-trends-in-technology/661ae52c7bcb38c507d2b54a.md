# --description--

Example: `What's the deal with Quantum Computers? Everybody is talking about them!` (you are asking what the situation connected/related to Quantum Computers is).

What does Tom mean by saying `what's the deal with biometrics?`

## --answers--

`What's the issue with biometrics?`

### --feedback--

`What's the issue with` suggests a problem, but Tom is asking for information, not indicating a problem.

---

`What's the problem with biometrics?`

### --feedback--

`What's the problem with` is grammatically correct but not as fitting for Tom's curious and friendly tone.

`What's the news with biometrics?`

### --feedback--

`What's the news with` doesn't align with Tom asking for information about biometrics; it's more about current events.
