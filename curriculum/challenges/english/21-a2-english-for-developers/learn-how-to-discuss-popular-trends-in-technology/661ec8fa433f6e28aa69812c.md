<!-- (Audio) Alice: For example, they're experimenting with palm vein recognition and even behavioral biometrics, like typing patterns to enhance security. -->

# --description--

`To enhance security` means making something safer or more protected. In the context of biometrics, using techniques like palm vein recognition and behavioral biometrics helps make security systems more effective and less vulnerable to unauthorized access.

# --questions--

## --text--

What specific measures can be taken to enhance security in biometrics?

## --answers--

Implementing palm vein recognition

---

Decreasing security measures

### --feedback--

Decreasing security measures is the opposite of enhancing security.

---

Maintaining the current security protocols

### --feedback--

Maintaining the current security protocols may not necessarily involve making it better.

---

Avoiding the use of behavioral biometrics

### --feedback--

Avoiding the use of behavioral biometrics is a negation of a potential enhancement measure.
