<!-- (Audio) Alice: For example, they're experimenting with palm vein recognition and even behavioral biometrics, like typing patterns to enhance security. -->

# --description--

`Palm vein recognition` is a technology that identifies individuals based on the unique patterns of veins in their palms. It involves capturing and analyzing the vein patterns, which are distinctive for each person, providing a secure method of authentication.

`Behavioral biometrics` means studying and using unique behaviors as a way to identify and verify individuals. It includes things like how you type, how you move, or other distinctive actions that are specific to you.

# --questions--

## --text--

What innovations are researchers experimenting with in biometrics these days?

## --answers--

Measuring the temperature of palms and biometrics related to a persons behavior.

### --feedback--

It does not have to do with the temperature of palms, but with the pattern of veins in the palm.

---

The pattern of veins in a person's palm and their eating habits.

### --feedback--

`Behavioral biometrics` could study eating habits, but that's not all it studies.

---

The size of someone's palm and the way someone moves their legs.

### --feedback--

The palm vein recognition check is not about the size of one's palm. The way someone moves their legs is only a part of their behavior.

Palm vein recognition and behavioral biometrics.
