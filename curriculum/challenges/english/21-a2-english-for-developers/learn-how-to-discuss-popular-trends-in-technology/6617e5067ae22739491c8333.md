# --description--

A `chatbot` is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users. Instead of a person, it's a computer that replies to your messages. Companies use chatbots on their websites to help answer questions or provide information. So, when you see a little chat window pop up when you're shopping online, that's a chatbot ready to assist you!
