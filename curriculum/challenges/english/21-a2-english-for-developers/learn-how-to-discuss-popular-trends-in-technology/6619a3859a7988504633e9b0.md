<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Quantum computers can also help scientists with research. -->

# --description--

A `scientist` is someone who studies and learns about nature and the world. They ask questions and try to find answers.

`Research` means trying to find more information about something. You might do research by reading books, looking online, or testing to learn new things. When you talk about `scientific research`, it normally involves a more formal setting, with regulated conditions.

The word `also` can be used in substitution to `too` and can be added in different places in a sentence. Examples: `He can play the guitar, but he plays the piano, too.` (`too` is normally added in the end of the sentence, preceded by a comma). `He can play the guitar, but he can also play the piano` (you can add `also` before the verb and in the middle of the sentence). These two sentences mean the same.
