<!-- (Audio) Tom: AR apps use your device's camera to add digital content to the physical world. -->

# --description--

When you say `add something to something else`, it means putting or including that thing with another. It's like combining two things to create something new and improved. For example, if you add sugar to your tea, you are putting sugar into the tea to make it sweeter.
