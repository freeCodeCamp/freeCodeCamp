<!-- (Audio) James: Sarah, have you heard about Quantum Computing? I just heard about it for the first time. Are you familiar with it? -->

# --description--

`To be familiar` with something is to know at least a bit about the topic. If you ask someone `are you familiar with this?`, you are asking them if they know it. Example: `I have never seen this soda before. It's delicious. Are you familiar with it?` (you are asking if the person knows and/or tasted that soda before).
