# --description--

`Collaboration tools` are software or applications that help people work together on projects or tasks, especially when they are not physically in the same location. These tools make it easier for individuals to communicate, share information, and coordinate their efforts, even if they are working from different places.

Some `collaboration tools` are like talking on the computer (Chat Apps), some are like talking face-to-face on the computer (Video Conferencing), and some are like sharing a digital notebook where you both can write and draw (Document Sharing).
