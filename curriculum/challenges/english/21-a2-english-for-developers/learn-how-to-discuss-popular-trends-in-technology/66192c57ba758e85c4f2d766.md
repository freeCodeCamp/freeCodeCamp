# --description--

When you say something `is likely to`, it means something is expected or probable to happen. It indicates a high chance that a particular action will occur in the future. For example, if a certain programming language is easy to use, you might say it is likely to remain popular, meaning it will probably stay popular in the future.
 
In English, you can use verbs with the word `to` before them to talk about different actions. For example, `to eat`, `to run`, or `to learn`. When you talk about something that needs to happen or might happen in the future, you use this structure. For instance, `I want to eat`, `She likes to run`, or `They need to learn`.
 
So, `to + infinitive` is a way you express actions that could or should occur, often indicating plans, desires, or possibilities.
