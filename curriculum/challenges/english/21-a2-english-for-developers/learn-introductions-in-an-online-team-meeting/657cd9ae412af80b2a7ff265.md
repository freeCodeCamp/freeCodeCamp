# --description--

`Any` is used to indicate no matter which one, no matter when, or no matter what. For example, `You can ask me any question` means you can ask all kinds of questions.

`Even` is used to emphasize something unexpected or to include something in addition. For example, `She can speak many languages, even Tupi` means that it's surprising or notable that she can also speak Tupi, in addition to other languages. 

The word even highlights something extra or beyond what is usual.
