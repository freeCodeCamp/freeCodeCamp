<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Bob: Alright, team. This is Alice's first day with us, so please let me introduce you all to her.
-->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question. 

# --questions--

## --text--

Which words in Bob's sentence indicate that he is talking to a group of people?

## --answers--

`Alice`

### --feedback--

While `Alice` is mentioned, this word doesn't indicate that Bob is speaking to a group.

---

`first day`

### --feedback--

`First day` refers to a period of time, not to a group of people.

---

`introduce`

### --feedback--

`Introduce` is an action but does not by itself indicate that Bob is addressing a group.

---

`team` and `you all`
