# --description--

`All of you` is a phrase used to include every person in a group. For example, `I want to thank all of you for coming` means thanking every person who came. 

The word `your` can refer to something that belongs to either an individual or a group, depending on the context. 

When talking to one person, `your` refers to something belonging to that individual. For example, `Your book is on the table` means the book belongs to the individual you're speaking to. 

In contrast, when speaking to a group, `your` can refer to something that belongs to all of them. For example, `Your project is impressive` means the project belonging to the entire group is impressive. Understanding the context helps to determine if `your` is singular or plural.
