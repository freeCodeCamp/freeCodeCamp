# --description--

In English, many professions are named by adding `er` to the end of a word that describes what the person does. 

For example, a `programmer` is someone who `programs`, a `developer` is someone who `develops` software or systems. Another example is a `designer`, who is a person that `designs` websites, graphics, or products. 

By adding `er` to a verb, you create a noun that describes a person's job. It doesn´t apply to all professions but you'll see this pattern in many.
