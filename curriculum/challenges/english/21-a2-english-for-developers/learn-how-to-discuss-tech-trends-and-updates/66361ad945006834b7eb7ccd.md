<!-- (Audio) Brian: I see. Maybe we could try it on some of our more demanding projects.
-->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which words or expressions does Brian use to make a suggestion?

## --answers--

`I see, we try it`

### --feedback--

This option misses the key modal and adverb that soften the suggestion and express possibility.

---

`some of our`

### --feedback--

These words detail the possible amount of projects to use it on but do not contribute to the formulation of the suggestion itself.

---

`more demanding projects`

### --feedback--

While these words describe the nature of the projects, they are not part of the phrase that makes the suggestion.

---

`Maybe, could`
