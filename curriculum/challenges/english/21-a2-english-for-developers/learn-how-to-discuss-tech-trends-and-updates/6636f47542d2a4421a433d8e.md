# --description--

For longer adjectives, typically those with two or more syllables, you use `more` or `less` before the adjective to form comparatives. This structure helps compare qualities or characteristics of different items or people.

Examples:

`This book is more interesting than the one I read last week.` `More interesting` is the comparative form of `interesting`, used to compare the level of interest between two books.

`He is less experienced than his colleague.` `Less experienced` is the comparative form of `experienced`, used to compare the amount of experience between two individuals.
