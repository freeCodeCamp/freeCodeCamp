<!-- (Audio) Lisa: It's especially useful when we need to handle variable workloads and want to save on server management tasks. -->

# --description--

The word `especially` is used to emphasize one person or thing over all others. It's often used to indicate that something applies more strongly to one item compared to others. For example, `I like many sports, especially basketball.` This indicates a particular preference for basketball over other sports.
