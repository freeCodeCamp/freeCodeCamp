# --description--

`Serverless computing` is a `cloud computing` execution model where the cloud provider runs the server and dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources. The pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by an application, rather than on pre-purchased units of capacity. It's called `serverless` because the developers do not have to deal with servers - they just upload their code, and the cloud provider takes care of the rest.

For example, in `serverless computing`, you might upload a function to a cloud service, and it runs only when needed.
