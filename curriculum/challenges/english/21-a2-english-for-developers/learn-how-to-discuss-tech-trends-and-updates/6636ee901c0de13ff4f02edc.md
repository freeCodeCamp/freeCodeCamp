<!-- (Audio) Lisa: Serverless computing is an interesting concept, Tom. It's when we run code without managing servers, like having computer helpers. -->

# --description--

The term `run code` refers to the action of executing or operating a program or script by a computer. To `run` in this context means to start the process and see it through until the program does what it's designed to do, whether it's calculating numbers, sorting data, or anything else.

The phrase `run code without managing servers` refers to executing computer programs or applications without the need to handle the physical or virtual servers on which the code runs. This is a key aspect of serverless computing, where the cloud provider manages the servers, allowing developers to focus more on coding than on server management.
