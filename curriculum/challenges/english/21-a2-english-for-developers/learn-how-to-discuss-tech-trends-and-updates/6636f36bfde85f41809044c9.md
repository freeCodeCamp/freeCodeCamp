# --description--

Comparatives are used to compare two things or people. For short adjectives, typically those with one or two syllables, you add `-er` to the end of the word, like `tall` becomes `taller` and `small` becomes `smaller`. For words which end in `-y`, you change the `y` to `i` and add `-er`, like `happy` becomes `happier`.

Examples:

`He is taller than his brother.` - `Taller` is the comparative form of `tall`, used because the speaker is comparing the height of two people.

`This box is smaller than that one.` - `Smaller` is the comparative form of `small`, used to compare the size of two boxes.
