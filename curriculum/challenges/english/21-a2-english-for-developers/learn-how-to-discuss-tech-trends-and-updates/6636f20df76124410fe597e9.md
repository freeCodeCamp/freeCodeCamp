# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does Lisa describe `serverless computing`?

## --answers--

It is a cheaper way to use computers.

### --feedback--

While `serverless computing` can be cost-effective, Lisa's description focuses on the operational aspect, not directly on cost.

---

It is about using more servers in computing.

### --feedback--

This statement is incorrect; `serverless computing` involves using fewer, if any, visible servers to the developer.

---

It means programming without computers.

### --feedback--

`Serverless computing` still involves computers, specifically servers that are managed by the provider, not by the programmer.

---

It's like having computer helpers to run code without managing servers.
