<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I think so. Why don't we check out some of these tools to see if they can help us? Brian: I'm on it. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Does Brian agree with Sarah's suggestion, and why?

## --answers--

No, because he thinks it's a waste of time.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Brian's response `I'm on it` implies that he is already taking action, which shows agreement, not rejection.

---

Yes, because he indicates that he is already taking action on her suggestion.

---

No, he is asking for more time to think about it.

### --feedback--

This is incorrect. Brian's immediate response of `I'm on it` suggests readiness to act, not hesitation.

---

Yes, but he suggests a different approach to exploring the tools.

### --feedback--

Brian does not suggest a different approach; his response directly supports Sarah's suggestion by indicating that he is moving forward with it.
