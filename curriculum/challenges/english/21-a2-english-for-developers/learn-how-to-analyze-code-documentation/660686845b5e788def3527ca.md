`Sophie is working with a new API and is unsure how to BLANK its documentation effectively. Brian suggests she should BLANK by checking the BLANK and BLANK in the documentation for a clear idea of what the API offers. He then advises that once she's BLANK the endpoints, she should BLANK the BLANK and BLANK for each. This helps in understanding the API's use in projects.
