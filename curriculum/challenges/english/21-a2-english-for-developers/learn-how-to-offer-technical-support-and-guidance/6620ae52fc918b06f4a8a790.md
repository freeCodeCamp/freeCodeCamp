<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Now, let's talk about error handling. -->

# --description--

`Error handling` is an important concept in programming. It refers to the process of writing code that can manage and respond to errors that occur during execution. This prevents the program from crashing and allows for a smoother user experience. Techniques for `error handling` vary among programming languages. For instance, in Python, using try-except blocks is a common method.
