<!-- (Audio) Tom: Got it. So, if I indent the blocks consistently, it improves code readability? -->

To `indent` means to move the text or code inward from the margin of the document. In programming, `indenting` is used to make the structure of the code clearer and help in understanding how blocks of code relate to each other.

For example, `In Python, the body of a loop or a function is indented to show that it is part of that loop or function.`
