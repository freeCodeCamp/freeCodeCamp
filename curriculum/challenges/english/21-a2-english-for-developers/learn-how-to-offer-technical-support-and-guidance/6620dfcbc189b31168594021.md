Tom: I see. So by explaining the complex parts with comments, I’ll help other people understand the code. Is that right?

# --description--

Tom is using a common learning strategy: repeating information in his own words to confirm his understanding. 

He uses the preposition `by` to describe the method or way of doing something. 

In this case, he's talking about explaining complex or difficult parts of the code with comments. This helps other people, like future developers, understand the code. He ends his statement with a confirmation question, which is a good practice to confirm correct understanding.
