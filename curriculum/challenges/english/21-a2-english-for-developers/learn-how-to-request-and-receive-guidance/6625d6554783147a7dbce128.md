<!-- (Audio) Sarah: We can troubleshoot together. By the way, have you ever tried looking at the official documentation for this library? -->

# --description--

Sarah is offering assistance to Tom in his coding challenge. 

# --questions--

## --text--

Which part of Sarah's speech implies that she is offering help?

## --answers--

Asking if Tom has tried looking at the documentation

### --feedback--

While this shows interest, it's more of an inquiry than an offer of help.

---

Mentioning the official documentation for the library

### --feedback--

This is informative, but the offer of help is indicated elsewhere in her speech.

---

Discussing the use of libraries in programming

### --feedback--

Discussing libraries is part of the conversation, but it's not where she offers help.

---

Suggesting to troubleshoot together
