# --description--

`Time complexity` is a term from computer science. It describes how long an algorithm (a set of instructions) takes to complete, based on the size of the input. A simple example is washing dishes: washing one dish is quick, but washing many dishes takes longer. This is like time complexity in programming.

# --question--

## --text--

What is a simple explanation of `time complexity`?

## --answers--

It's how long it takes to wash dishes, depending on how many there are.

### --feedback--

The part that mentioned dishes was just an example. This has to do with the execution time of an algorithm.

---

It's about solving math problems quickly.

### --feedback--

`Time complexity` is not specifically about solving math problems.

---

It's the complexity of a clock's mechanism.

### --feedback--

`Time complexity` is related to algorithms, not clock mechanisms.

---

It's the time it takes for a program to finish its execution.
