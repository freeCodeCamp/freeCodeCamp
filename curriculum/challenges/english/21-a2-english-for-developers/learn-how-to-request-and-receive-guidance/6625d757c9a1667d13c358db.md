<!-- (Audio) Sarah: By the way, have you ever tried looking at the official documentation for this library? -->

# --description--

This task checks if you understand a simple question about using documentation.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Sarah want to know from Tom?

## --answers--

If Tom has ever read the guide for the library

---

If Tom has used this library in another project

### --feedback--

This choice is not quite right. Sarah is asking about reading the library's guide, not using the library in a project.

---

If Tom knows where the library is

### --feedback--

Sarah's question is about reading the official guide, not about finding the library.

---

If Tom likes the library

### --feedback--

The question isn't about whether Tom likes the library; it's about whether he has read the guide.
