# --description--

This task focuses on reviewing the use of `can` for expressing capability and the use of the verb `try` in the past continuous tense.

`Can` is used to talk about someone's ability to do something, like `I can solve this problem.`

`Try` in the past continuous (`was`/`were` + verb in the `-ing` form) indicates an ongoing action in the past, like `I was trying to fix the issue.`
