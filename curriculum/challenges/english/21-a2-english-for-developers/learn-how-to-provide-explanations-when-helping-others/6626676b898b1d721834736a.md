<!-- (Audio) Brian: Okay, let's take it step by step. Check the framework documentation for initialization instructions. It usually involves configuring settings or initializing the library. Sophie: I'll give that another look. Anything else? -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

From what Sophie says, could you assume she has already checked the framework documentation Brian mentions, and why?

## --answers--

No, she's looking at the documentation for the first time.

### --feedback--

Her phrase `another look` suggests she has already checked it once.

---

She's unsure about where to find the documentation.

### --feedback--

Sophie doesn't express uncertainty about finding the documentation.

---

Yes, because she says she'll give it another look, implying she's seen it before.

---

She's waiting for Brian to show her the documentation.

### --feedback--

Sophie indicates a plan to recheck it herself, not to wait for Brian.
