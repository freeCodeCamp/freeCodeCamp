# --description--

A `hard drive` is a component in computers used to store data permanently. It's like a large file cabinet where all digital files are kept. For example, when you save documents, photos, or music on your computer, they are stored on the `hard drive`.

It's different from temporary storage, which is like a desk where things are only kept for a short time while in use.
