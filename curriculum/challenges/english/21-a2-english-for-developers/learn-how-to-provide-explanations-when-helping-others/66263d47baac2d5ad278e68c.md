# --description--

`Integrate` means to combine or incorporate one thing into another so that they work together effectively. For example, `We need to integrate the new payment system into our website.`

`Framework` refers to a basic structure, set of rules, or guidelines used to develop or organize something complex. It provides a foundation and tools to build upon, making the development process smoother and more standardized. An example is using the `scrum framework` to manage software development project.

`Advice` refers to suggestions or recommendations given to help someone solve a problem or make a decision. When you ask if someone has any suggestions, tips, or guidance to offer, you can say `Any advice?` or `Could you give me some advice on how to improve my presentation skills?`
