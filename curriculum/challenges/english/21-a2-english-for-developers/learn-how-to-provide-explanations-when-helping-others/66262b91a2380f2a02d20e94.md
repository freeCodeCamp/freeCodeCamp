# --description--

The `storage` in computers has to do with the place where data is kept. It's like a digital cupboard where files are stored. For example, `saving photos on your computer uses its storage`.

`Storage space` is the amount of room available for storing data. It's like how much space you have in a cupboard. If you have a lot of `storage space`, you can save many files.
