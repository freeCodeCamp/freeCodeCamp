# --description--

Using the auxiliary verb `do` can be tricky when the main verb in the sentence is also `do`. 

But remember, `do` helps in asking questions, and when it's about someone else, like he or she, it changes to `does`. The question `What does she/he do?` is asking for information about a person's job.

`What does he does as the team lead?`

### --feedback--

You don't need to use `does` twice.
