# --description--

An `update` is new information or the latest news about something. When you `update` someone, you are giving them the most recent information.

The phrase `updates on project progress` means giving new information about the present projects. 

The preposition `on` in this context links the updates to the specific subject they are about - the project progress.

In English, you use `on` when you're talking about the topic of communication, like a presentation on science or an update on work. It shows a direct relationship between the communication and the topic.
