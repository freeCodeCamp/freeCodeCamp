<!-- (Audio) Tom: Absolutely! They are really fun. What is the team’s favorite?

Sarah: Many of us enjoy the monthly game night. Are you into board games?

Tom: Yes, I love board games! -->

# --description--

In conversations, you can ask someone if they have an interest or enjoy a particular activity. There are many ways to do that.

# --question--

## --text--

In the audio above there are two sentences that ask about interest. Which are they?

## --answers--

`Are you into playing board games?` and `They are really fun!`

### --feedback--

The first sentence is correct, but the second one does not ask about interest. It's a statement.

---

`What is the team’s favorite?` and `Many of us enjoy the monthly game night. `

### --feedback--

The first sentence is asking for a favorite thing, not interest in an activity. The second sentence is a statement, not a question.

---

`Are you going to board games?` and `What board games do you play?`

### --feedback--

The phrase `Are you going to board games?` is not grammatically correct. The second sentence is a question, but it's not about interest.

---

`What is the team’s favorite?` and `Are you into playing board games?`
