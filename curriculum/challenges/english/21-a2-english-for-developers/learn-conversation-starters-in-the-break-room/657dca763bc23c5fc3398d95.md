<!-- (audio) Tom: I can't wait for the first meeting I'll attend.
Sophie: Probably next Monday. -->

# --description--

`Probably` is used when you think something is likely to happen, but you're not 100% sure.

For example, you could say: `The code will probably run without errors after the update`, because you believe that, but there's still a small chance of an issue.

# --questions--

## --text--

When does Sophie think Tom will attend his first meeting?

## --answers--

Definitely next Monday.

### --feedback--

Sophie says `probably`, which does not imply anything definite.

---

Maybe in two weeks.

### --feedback--

Sophie uses `probably`, which suggests a greater level of certainty than maybe.

---

Next Monday, most likely.

---

On Friday.

### --feedback--

Friday was not mentioned in the dialog. It has to do with another day of the week.
