# --description--

The phrase `too long` is used when something takes more time than is necessary or desired. For example, `The meeting lasted four hours. Four hours is too long for a meeting!`

It's different from `so long`, which is often used to express that something takes a significant amount of time, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's more than what is wanted.
