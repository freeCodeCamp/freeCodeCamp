# --description--

Before you learned to ask questions using `do`, you can also use it to create negative sentences by combining `do` (for `I`, `you`, `we`, `they`) or `does` (for `he`, `she`, `it`) with the word `not` and placing it right before the main verb:

`I do not work everyday` - (Subject + `do` + `not` + main verb)

`It does not function` - (Subject + `does` + `not` + main verb)

Often, to be more practical people abbreviate `do not` to `don't` and `does not` to `doesn't`. 

Just like with questions, when you use `don't`, the main verb that comes after it will always be in its base form, no matter who you're talking about.
