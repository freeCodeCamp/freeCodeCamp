<!-- (audio) Sophie: Electric, for sure! Back to your hobbies, though, do you have any favorite photography theme?
Tom: I like landscapes and street photography, mostly. -->

# --description--

When elaborating questions about a third person singular (he, she or it) you might need to use the auxiliary verb `does` .

For example: If Alice is curious about Sophie's hobbies and wants to ask Tom, she can say, `Does Sophie like hiking?` The word `does` is used here because the subject is `Sophie,` a third person singular. `Does` is used to form questions in the present simple tense for he, she, or it.

# --questions--

## --text--

Does Tom have a favorite photography theme?

## --answers--

Yes, he does.

---

No, he doesn't.

### --feedback--

The dialogue indicates Tom does have favorite themes.

---

Yes, he do.

### --feedback--

`Yes, he do` is incorrect; it should be `Yes, he does.`

---

No, does he?

### --feedback--

`No, does he?` is not a statement but a question, and it implies doubt or surprise, not affirmation.
