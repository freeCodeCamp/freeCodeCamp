<!-- (audio) Maria: The bookstores I remember are all downtown. There is a bus that stops two blocks away. -->

# --description--

Maria informs Tom about public transportation options, specifically mentioning a transportation that stops nearby. This is important for getting around the city, especially to places that are not within walking distance.

`Two blocks away` means that you need to walk past two street corners to get to a place. It's a short walk in a city.

`Downtown` is the heart of a city where there are many shops, restaurants, and usually tall buildings.
