Sophie: Sometimes, but we normally discuss tasks and responsibilities for the week. -->

# --description--

In English, words like `sometimes,` `always,` and `never` are used to describe the frequency of an action.

`Sometimes` is used when an action happens on certain occasions but not every time. For example, `I sometimes have coffee for breakfast.` It indicates possibility but not certainty. 

`Always` is used when an action happens every single time without fail. For instance, `The sun always rises in the east.` It shows a consistent or habitual action.

`Never` means an action does not happen at any time. For example, `She never eats meat`, indicating a complete absence of the action.

# --instructions--

correct adverb of frequency.

# --fillInTheBlank--
