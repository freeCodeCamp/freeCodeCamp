<!-- (audio) Tom: Does this include brainstorming sessions? Sophie: Occasionally, yeah. It depends on the project's needs. -->

# --description--

A `brainstorming session` is a meeting where people come together to think of new ideas or solve problems. In a programming team, it might be a time when everyone suggests different ways to tackle a coding challenge.

# --questions--

## --text--

When do `brainstorming sessions` happen according to the conversation?

## --answers--

Always when tasks are assigned.

### --feedback--

Brainstorming is not just for when we decide who does what.

---

When the client needs it.

### --feedback--

Client needs don't always lead to brainstorming.

---

When they are included in the meeting.

### --feedback--

Just because there is a meeting doesn't mean they will brainstorm.

---

When the project needs it.
