# --description--

In English, some verbs are conjugated. This means they change the form according to the person you are talking about. For most verbs, when we talk about another person like `he,` `she,` or `it,` we add an `-s` or `-es` to the verb. 

For example: If you talk about Tom and photography you can say: `Tom takes photographs,` not `Tom take photographs.` This is how you show in your sentence that the action is done by Tom in the present tense.

For negative sentences, you can use `doesn't` followed by the base form of the verb. 

You do not add `-s` or `-es.` because `does` is already conjugated (`do+es`).

For example, if Tom doesn't do video recording as a hobby, you can say, `He doesn't record videos.`.

Understanding this difference is crucial for talking about habits and actions accurately. Now, let's apply this understanding to what Sophie does in her free time.
