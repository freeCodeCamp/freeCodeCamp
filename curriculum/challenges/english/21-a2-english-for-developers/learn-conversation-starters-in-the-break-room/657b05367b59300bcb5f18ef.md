# --description--

In English, you can use the verb `to be` to ask questions about feelings, states, or conditions. 
When you want to ask such questions, you just swap the positions of the subject (like `you` or `he`) and the verb `to be` (like `are` or `is`). For example, to turn this sentence `You are a developer.` into a question, you switch `you` and `are`:

`Are you a developer?` Notice how the order changes to ask a question.

Here are some more examples of turning statements into questions using `to be`: 

| Affirmative | Interrogative |
| --- | --- |
| `He is here.` | `Is he here?` |
| `They are ready.` | `Are they ready?` |

# --instructions--
