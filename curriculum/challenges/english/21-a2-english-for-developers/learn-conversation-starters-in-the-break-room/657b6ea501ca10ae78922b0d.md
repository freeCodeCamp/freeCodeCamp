# --description--

Let's use `do` to ask about daily routines.

When you use `do` as an auxiliary verb in a question, the main verb must stay in its base form. For example:

Statement: `She works as a Full Stack dev.`

Question: `Does she work as a Full Stack dev?`

Notice in the example above that `work` doesn't change to `works`, even when asking about a third person singular subject like `he,` `she,` or `it.`

Remember, for this kind of question you need an auxiliary verb. Also, pay attention to word order.

---

`You do write code every day?`

### --feedback--
