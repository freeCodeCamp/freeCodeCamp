# --description--

So far, you've exercised how to ask questions with `do` and make negative sentences with `don't.`
Let's review them. Remember:

Affirmative: `I do work on weekends.` (means the person works on weekends)
Negative: `I don't work on weekends.` (means the person does not work on weekends)

# --instructions--

Read the dialogue excerpt and fill in the blanks using `do` or `don't.`

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Tom: How about you? BLANK you have any hobbies?`

`Sophie: That's cool! I like it, but I BLANK think of it as a hobby.`

## --blanks--

`Do`

### --feedback--

In the first blank, Tom is asking a question about Sophie's hobbies, which requires `do.`

`don't`

### --feedback--
