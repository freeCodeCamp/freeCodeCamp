Tom: Yes, I've played both before. Great choices. -->


# --description--

The present perfect is a tense used to indicate a link between the present and the past. The time of the action is before now but not specified, and the person using it is usually more interested in the result than in the action itself. For example:

`I played this game yesterday.`  - This is in the simple past tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at a specific time in the past, which is yesterday. 

`I have played this game before.` - This is in the present perfect tense. It states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.

`I’ve played this game before.` - This sentence is also in the present perfect tense, using the contraction `I've` for `I have`. Like the previous example, it states that the action of playing the game happened at an unspecified time in the past.
