<!-- (audio) Tom: Yes, it's great! Everyone is friendly. Listen, how about the team-building activities here? Are they cool?
Sarah: Yes, we go out with the team sometimes. Are you into these activities? -->

# --description--

`To be into` something means to be interested in it or to enjoy it.

The word `these` is a demonstrative pronoun that refers to specific items or ideas mentioned previously in the conversation.

When Sarah asks, `Are you into these activities?` she uses `these` to refer back to something Tom just mentioned. It's a way to specify exactly what activities she's talking about without repeating the whole phrase.
