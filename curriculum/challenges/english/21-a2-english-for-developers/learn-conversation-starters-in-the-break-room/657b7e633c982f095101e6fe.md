<!-- (audio) Tom: Wow! Electric or acoustic?
Sophie: Electric, for sure! Back to your hobbies, though, do you have any favorite photography theme? -->


# --description--

Sometimes you want to talk about what you or someone else enjoys. For example, if your friend enjoys reading, you can say, `My friend likes reading.`

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence is correct about Sophie's guitar preference?

## --answers--

`Sophie likes electric guitar.`

---

`Sophie like electric guitar.`

### --feedback--

In English, when we refer to `he,` `she,` or `it,` we need to add an `s` to the verb, making it `likes.` For example, if your friend enjoys reading, you would say, `She likes reading.`

---

`Sophie does likes electric guitar.`

### --feedback--

`Does likes` is incorrect; `does` should not be used together with `likes.`

---

`Sophie liked electric guitar.`

### --feedback--

`Liked` is past tense, but we are discussing her current preference.
