# --description--

If you need to get some money and are looking for a machine that gives out cash, you can ask, `Is there an ATM nearby?`

An ATM, which stands for Automated Teller Machine, is a machine where you can use a bank card to take out cash.

The word `nearby` means it's not far from you, maybe a short walk away. It's a handy word to use when you need to find something quickly in a new place.
