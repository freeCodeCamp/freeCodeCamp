# --description--

The term `so far` means up to this moment or until now. It is used when talking about a time that started in the past and continues to the present. If someone asks, `Are you happy with the workplace so far?` They want to know if you liked your workplace from the first day up to today.

Another example: if you say, `The project is good so far,` it means from the beginning of the project until now, everything is good.

In our dialogue, Sarah asks Tom if he is happy with his new job so far. She is asking about his time at the job from the beginning until their conversation.
