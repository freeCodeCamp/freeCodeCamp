# --description--

Let's practice creating negative sentences with an auxiliary verb.

# --questions--

## --text--

Choose the sentence that correctly uses `don't` to express what someone does not do.

## --answers--

I don't coding on weekends.

### --feedback--

Incorrect: `coding` should be in the base form `code` when used with `don't.`

---

I don't code on weekends.

---

I don't codes on weekends.

### --feedback--

The verb should not have an `s` at the end when used with `don't.`

---

I does not code on weekends.

### --feedback--

`does not` is used with third-person singular subjects (he, she, it); with `I,` it should be `don't.`
