<!-- (audio) Tom: Those are great traits for someone in her position, I think. What does she do as the team lead? -->

# --description--

Imagine you're pointing to something that is not right next to you but a little far away; you use `those`. If something is very close to you, like the book in your hands, you use `these`. 

In the dialogue, Tom says `Those are great traits...` because he's talking about the traits Sophie mentioned just a moment ago. He's not talking about traits that are being shown to him right this second.
