<!-- (audio) Sophie: We do. It's a chance to update everyone on project progress. -->

# --description--

The word `everyone` is used to refer to all people in a group. The opposite of `everyone` is `no one` and `nobody` 

`No one` and `nobody` both mean not a single person.

# --questions--

## --text--

Who does Sophie say will be updated during the meetings?

## --answers--

No one from the team.

### --feedback--

`No one` means zero people, but Sophie says `everyone` will be updated, which is the opposite.

---

Only new team members.

### --feedback--

Sophie mentions `everyone,` which means not just new members, but all members, including those who have been on the team for a while.

---

Nobody from the team.

### --feedback--

`Nobody` is like saying `no one,` which again is the opposite of `everyone` that Sophie uses.

---

All the team members.
