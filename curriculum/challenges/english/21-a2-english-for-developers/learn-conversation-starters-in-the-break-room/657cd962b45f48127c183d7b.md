# --description--

When you speak about what another person does every day, like your friend or a teacher, and you use `he,` `she,` or `it` you will often need to conjugate the verb of your sentence. 

As you already studied, For most verbs conjugation can be simple. You just  add `s` or `es` to the end of the verb.

For example:

`You talk` -> `He talks`
`They do` -> `It does`
