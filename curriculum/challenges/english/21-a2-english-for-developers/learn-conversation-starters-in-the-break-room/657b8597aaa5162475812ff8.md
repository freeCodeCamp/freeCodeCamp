<!-- (audio) Sophie: I enjoy classic rock, but any nice tune makes my day.
Tom: Cool! I want to hear you play some day. -->

# --description--

When you want to talk about what someone hopes to do in the future, you can use `want to` to express desire or intention. 

# --questions--

## --text--

Does Tom want to hear Sophie play the guitar?

## --answers--

`No, he doesn't want to.`

### --feedback--

Listen again and pay attention to see if Tom is really using a negative sentence.

---

`Yes, he wants to.`

---

`No, he don't want to.`

### --feedback--

`Don't` is not correct with `he`; it should be `doesn't.`

---

`Yes, he wanted to.`

### --feedback--

`Wanted` is past tense, but Tom is talking about the present.
