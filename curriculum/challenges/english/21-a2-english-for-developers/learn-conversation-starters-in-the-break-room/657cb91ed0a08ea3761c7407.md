<!-- (audio) Tom: Hey, Sophie! Tell me about our team lead, Maria. What is she like? -->

# --description--

In English, you ask two different questions when you want to know about someone's personality and someone's physical appearance. `What is he/she like?` is used to ask about personality traits, such as being kind, intelligent, or funny. 

On the other hand, `What does he/she look like?` is the question you would ask if you want to know about how someone looks, for example, if they are tall, have blonde hair, or wear glasses.
