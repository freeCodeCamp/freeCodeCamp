# --description--

The phrase `have a chance to speak` implies that everyone is given the opportunity to contribute to the conversation.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does it mean when `all the team members have a chance to speak`?

## --answers--

Everyone has the opportunity to express their thoughts.

---

Only certain members are allowed to talk.

### --feedback--

`Chance` here means the possibility for everyone, not just select individuals.

---

Team members can speak whenever they want, without order.

### --feedback--

While everyone has a chance, it is implied that there is an order in the context of a meeting.

---

No one is allowed to speak during the meeting.

### --feedback--

The statement clearly says that all members have the opportunity, so it cannot mean that no one can speak.
