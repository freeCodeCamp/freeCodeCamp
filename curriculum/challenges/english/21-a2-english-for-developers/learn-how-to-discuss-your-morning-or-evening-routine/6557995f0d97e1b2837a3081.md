# --description--

Remember, adjectives are words that describe or give more information about nouns. They can tell you how something looks, feels, or acts. For example:

* `Quick` describes something done in a short time.
* `Relaxed` describes something or someone calm and not strict.
* `Alert` describes being fully aware and paying attention.
