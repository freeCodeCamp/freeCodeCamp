# --description--

Adjectives describe or provide more information about nouns or pronouns. They usually come before the noun they modify. For example:

- `The blue sky` - Here, `blue` is an adjective describing the noun `sky`. Notice how the adjective `blue` comes before the noun.

- `She enjoys early mornings.` - The adjective `early` describes the type of mornings she enjoys.

- `He has a quick shower in the morning.` - The adjective `quick` describes how short the shower is.

Adjectives can also make language more expressive by giving details about a person, place, or thing. For example:

Instead of saying `It seems like you have a lot of energy this morning`, you could say `You look energetic this morning`. Here, the adjective `energetic` is more concise and expressive, showing that someone has a lot of energy in a positive way.
