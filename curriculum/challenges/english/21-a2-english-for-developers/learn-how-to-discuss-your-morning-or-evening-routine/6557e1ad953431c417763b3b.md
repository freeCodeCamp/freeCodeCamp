<!-- (Audio) Sarah: It's my pleasure. It's the consistency that helps me start the day on the right foot. -->

# --description--

The word `consistency` refers to the quality of always behaving or performing in a similar way, or of always happening in a similar way. It's often used to describe regular habits or behaviors. For example:

`Her consistency in studying every day led to great results.`

The phrase `on the right foot` is an idiom meaning to start something in a positive or successful way. For example:

`Starting the day with a healthy breakfast sets you on the right foot.`
