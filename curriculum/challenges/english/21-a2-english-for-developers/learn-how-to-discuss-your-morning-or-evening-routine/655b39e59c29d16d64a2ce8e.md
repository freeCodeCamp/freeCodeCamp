<!-- (Audio) Sophie: That's a good mix of indoor and outdoor activities. I don't work at the computer on weekends like you, though. I save that for the weekdays, I suppose. -->

# --description--

`Indoor` refers to activities done inside a building, while `outdoor` means activities done outside. For example:

`Indoor activities include reading and cooking. Outdoor activities involve hiking and gardening.`

`Though` is an expression you use to show contrast between two sentences, similar to `but`. It can also be used in the middle or in the end of a sentence, not only in the beginning. For example:

`I know we wanted to travel. We don't have the money for the tickets, though.`

`I suppose` is used to express a mild assumption or agreement. For example:

`I suppose we could meet tomorrow.` (mild agreement or suggestion)
