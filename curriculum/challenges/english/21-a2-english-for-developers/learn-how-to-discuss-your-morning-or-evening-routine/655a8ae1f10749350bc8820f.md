<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Plan simple and quick meals for weekdays. Involve the kids in setting the table as well. -->

# --description--

Adjectives usually come before the nouns they describe, and there's a specific order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose. For example: `A beautiful old Italian painting` (opinion, age, origin)

In the phrase `simple and quick meals`, `simple` (describing ease) and `quick` (describing speed) are adjectives. The order is flexible because they belong to different categories (opinion and speed).

Listen to Sarah's advice and focus on the use and order of adjectives.
