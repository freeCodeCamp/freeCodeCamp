<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Anyway, before leaving for work, I like to check my emails and messages to see if there are any urgent updates from the team. -->

# --description--

The word `if` is often used in conditional statements to talk about a possible situation and its consequences. For example:

`If it rains, I will bring an umbrella.` 
(The action of bringing an umbrella depends on the possibility of rain.)

`If you need help, just ask.` 
(The offer to help is conditional on the other person needing it.)
