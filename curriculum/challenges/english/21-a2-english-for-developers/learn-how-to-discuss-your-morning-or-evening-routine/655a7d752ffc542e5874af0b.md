<!-- (Audio) Jake: Do you have any ideas that could help? -->

# --description--

Understanding the difference between `can` and `could` is crucial in English. 

`Can` is used to express ability, possibility, or to ask permission in the present or future.

`Could` is often used for polite requests, suggestions, or to talk about ability in the past. For example:

`I can code very well` (present ability)
`Can I leave early today?` (asking for permission)

`Could you pass me that tool, please?` (polite request)
`When I first learned programming, I could spend hours debugging without getting tired` (past ability)
