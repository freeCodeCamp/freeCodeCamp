# --description--

Words ending in `y` often describe a state or quality. For example:

If you add `y` to the noun `sleep`, you create the adjective `sleepy`, which means feeling a need to sleep or being tired. 

The `y` transforms the noun `sleep` into an adjective describing a condition. Similarly:

`snow` + `y` = `snowy` (having a lot of snow)
`rain` + `y` = `rainy` (having a lot of rain)
