<!-- (Audio) Maria: On Fridays, I like to hang out with friends. We normally meet at a bar, chat and have something to eat and drink. But I'm not really a night owl, so I like to be back home by 9:30 tops. -->

# --description--
A `night owl` is someone who stays up late. For example: `He's a night owl, often working past midnight` (stays up late)

`Hang out` means to spend time relaxing or socializing. For example: `We hang out at the park on weekends` (spending leisure time)

`Be back` means to return, and `tops` is used informally to indicate the maximum amount or time. For example: 

`I'll be back by dinner` (returning before a specific time)

`The meeting will last one hour, tops` (no longer than one hour)
