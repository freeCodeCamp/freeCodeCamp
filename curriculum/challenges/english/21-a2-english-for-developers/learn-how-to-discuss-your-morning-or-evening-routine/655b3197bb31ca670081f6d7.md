# --description--

You can create adjectives that express the highest degree of something. These are the superlative adjectives. They show that nothing else can exceed a certain level. The general rule is:

Short adjectives: create a superlative by ending `-est` at the end of the word. 

`She enjoys the fullest her weekdays` (`the` + `full` + `est`)

Long adjectives: Just add `the most` before the adjective. 

`This is the most interesting book I've read.` (`the most` + `interesting`)

This is an introduction to these adjectives. You’ll learn more in the future.
