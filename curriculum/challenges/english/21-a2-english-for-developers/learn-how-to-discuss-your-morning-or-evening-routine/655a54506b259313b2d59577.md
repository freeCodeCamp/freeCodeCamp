<!-- (Audio) Expert: If you start the day feeling relaxed, you may have a more productive day. -->

# --description--

Conditional sentences often use `if` to describe a situation (cause) that will lead to a particular result (consequence). They typically consist of two parts: the `if` clause (condition) and the main clause (result). For example:

`If you sleep well, you will feel refreshed.` (condition: sleeping well; result: feeling refreshed)
