<!-- (Audio) Expert: Another thing: don't skip breakfast. Breakfast gives you the energy to start the day. If you skip it, you probably compensate later by eating too much or you feel sluggish in the morning. Have a balanced breakfast instead. -->
# --description--

The verb `to skip` means to not do or not include something that you usually do or that should be done. 

`Compensate` means to make up for something that is missed or lacking. It's often used to describe actions taken to balance out an absence or deficiency. For example:

`If you skip lunch, you might compensate by eating more at dinner.` (not having lunch and then eating more later to make up for it)
