<!-- (Audio) James: An early coffee and then breakfast! I had never thought of that! -->

# --description--

The word `never` is an adverb used to mean `not at any time` or `not ever`. It's often used to talk about things that someone doesn't do or hasn't done. For example:

`I have never been to Australia.` (this means the person has not visited Australia at any time)
`She never eats fast food.` (this means she does not eat fast food at any time)

The word `thought` is the past tense of `think`. `Thought of that` means to have considered or come up with an idea in the past. For example:

`I thought of going to the beach, but it was too cold.` (this means the person considered going to the beach)

# --question--

## --text--

What does James mean when he says, `I had never thought of that`?

## --answers--

He had not considered that idea before

---

He frequently thinks about that

### --feedback--

`Never` indicates the absence of an action or thought, so it means he had not thought about it, not that he frequently does.

---

He always avoids thinking about that

### --feedback--

`Never thought of that` means he hadn't considered it, not necessarily that he actively avoids it.

---

He occasionally thinks about that

### --feedback--

`Never` suggests it hasn't happened at any time, so it's not about occasional thoughts.
