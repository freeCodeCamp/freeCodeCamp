<!-- (Audio) James: I'll try some of these tips. Maybe I can get more productive in the morning as well. -->

# --description--

`As well` is a phrase used to add something to what has just been said, similar to `also` or `too`. It's often used to include something or someone else in an action or statement. For example:

`I'll have coffee and a muffin as well.` (not only coffee, but also a muffin)

# --questions--

### --feedback--

### --feedback--

The phrase implies a possibility of increased productivity, not becoming less productive.
