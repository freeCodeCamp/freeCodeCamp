# --description--

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks to run concurrently, without blocking the execution of other tasks.

In this challenge you would learn how concurrency works in Python by building a prime number generator.

To start, import the `asyncio` module, which provides tools for working with asynchronous code.

# --hints--

You should use the `import` keyword followed by `asyncio` to import the `asyncio` library.

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```
