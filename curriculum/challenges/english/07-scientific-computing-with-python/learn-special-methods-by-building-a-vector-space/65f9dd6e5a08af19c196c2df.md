# --description--

The vector resulting from the subtraction of one vector from another is made of the difference of each of their components. For example, subtracting `(2, 4)` from `(1, 2)` generates a third vector `(-1, -2)`, where `-1` is the difference between `1` and `2` and `-2` is the difference between `2` and `4`.

As you did before in `__add__`, declare a `kwargs` variable after the `if` statement. Assign it a dictionary comprehension that iterates through `__dict__` and creates a key-value pair for each key (`i`) in `__dict__`, where the key is the same as the current iteration and its value is the difference between the values of the `i` attributes of two operands.

        kwargs = {i: self.__getattribute__(i) + other.__getattribute__(i) for i in self.__dict__}
