## Description
<section id='description'>
In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

You can access <a href='https://repl.it/@freeCodeCamp/fcc-shape-calculator' target='_blank'>the full project description and starter code on Repl.it</a>.

After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in 'README.md', submit your project link below.
