# --description--

Below the `h2` element in the second card, add a `p` element with this text:

```md
This is the story of Dave as he learns to cook everything from pancakes to pasta, one recipe at a time.
```


# --hints--

You should have a `p` element nested inside the second `.card` element.

```js
const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.card');
assert.exists(cards[1]?.querySelector('p'));
```

Your second card's `p` element's text should be `This is the story of Dave as he learns to cook everything from pancakes to pasta, one recipe at a time.`.

```js
const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.card');
assert.equal(cards[1]?.querySelector('p')?.innerText?.trim(), "This is the story of Dave as he learns to cook everything from pancakes to pasta, one recipe at a time.");
```

Your second card's `p` element should be below your `h2` element.

```js
const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.card');
assert.exists(cards[1]?.querySelector('h2 + p'));
```
