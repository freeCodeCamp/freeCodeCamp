# --description--

Below the `h2` element in the first element having a class of `card`, add a `p` element with the following text:

```md
This is an epic story of Sally and her dog Rex as they navigate through other worlds.
```

# --hints--

You should have a `p` element nested inside the element having a class of `card`.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('.card p'));
```

Your `p` element's text should be `This is an epic story of Sally and her dog Rex as they navigate through other worlds.`.

```js
assert.equal(document.querySelector('.card p')?.innerText.trim(), "This is an epic story of Sally and her dog Rex as they navigate through other worlds.");
```

Your `p` element should be below your `h2` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('.card h2 + p'));
```
