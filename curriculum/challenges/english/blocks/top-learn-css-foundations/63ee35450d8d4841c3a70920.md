# --description--

Internal CSS (or embedded CSS) involves adding the CSS within the HTML file itself instead of creating a completely separate file. With the internal method, you place all the rules inside of a pair of opening and closing `<style>` tags, which are then placed inside of the opening and closing `<head>` tags of your HTML file. Since the styles are being placed directly inside of the `<head>` tags, you no longer need a `<link>` element that the external method requires.

Besides these differences, the syntax is exactly the same as the external method (selector, curly braces, declarations):

```html
<head>
  <style>
    div {
      color: white;
      background-color: black;
    }

    p {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>...</body>
```

This method can be useful for adding unique styles to a single page of a website, but it doesnâ€™t keep things separate like the external method, and depending on how many rules and declarations there are it can cause the HTML file to get pretty big.
