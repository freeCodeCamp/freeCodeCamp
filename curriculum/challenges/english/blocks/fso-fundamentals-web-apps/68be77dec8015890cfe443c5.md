# --description--

The homepage of the example application works like a traditional web application. When entering the page, the browser fetches the HTML document detailing the structure and the textual content of the page from the server.

The server has formed this document somehow. The document can be a static text file saved into the server's directory. The server can also form the HTML documents dynamically according to the application's code, using, for example, data from a database. The HTML code of the example application has been formed dynamically because it contains information on the number of created notes.

The HTML code of the homepage is formed dynamically on the server as follows:

```js
const getFrontPageHtml = noteCount => {
  return `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class='container'>
          <h1>Full stack example app</h1>
          <p>number of notes created ${noteCount}</p>
          <a href='/notes'>notes</a>
          <img src='kuva.png' width='200' />
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
`
}

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  const page = getFrontPageHtml(notes.length)
  res.send(page)
})
```

You don't have to understand the code just yet.

The content of the HTML page has been saved as a template string or a string that allows for evaluating, for example, variables, like `noteCount`, in the midst of it. The dynamically changing part of the homepage, the number of saved notes (in the code noteCount), is replaced by the current number of notes (in the code `notes.length`) in the template string.

Writing HTML amid the code is of course not smart, but for old-school PHP programmers, it was a normal practice.

In traditional web applications, the browser is "dumb". It only fetches HTML data from the server, and all application logic is on the server. A server can be created using [Java Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) , [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) or [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) to name just a few examples.

The example uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) library with Node.js. This course will use Node.js and Express to create web servers.

# --questions--

## --text--

In the example application, how is the number of created notes displayed on the homepage?

## --answers--

The browser calculates the number of notes and updates the HTML dynamically.

### --feedback--

The browser in traditional web applications is "dumb" and does not handle application logic.

---

The HTML page is a static file where the note count is manually written.

### --feedback--

This would not reflect changes dynamically since static files don’t update automatically.

---

The server dynamically generates the HTML using template strings and inserts the current number of notes.

---

The number of notes is shown using client-side JavaScript that fetches the count after the page loads.

### --feedback--

This would require JavaScript in the browser, but in this example, the server handles the logic.
