# --description--

Before we start programming, we will go through some principles of web development by examining an example application at [https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp).

The application exists only to demonstrate some basic concepts of the course and is, by no means, an example of how a modern web application should be made. On the contrary, it demonstrates some old techniques of web development which could even be considered bad practices nowadays.

Code will conform to contemporary best practices from part 1 onwards.

Open the example application in your browser. Sometimes this takes a while.

The course material was done with and adapted for the Chrome browser.

**The 1st rule of web development**: Always keep the Developer Console open on your web browser. On macOS, open the console by pressing `F12` or `option-cmd-i` simultaneously. On Windows or Linux, open the console by pressing `F12` or `ctrl-shift-i` simultaneously. The console can also be opened via the context menu.

Remember to always keep the Developer Console open when developing web applications.

The console looks like this:

Make sure that the `Network` tab is open, and check the `Disable cache` option as shown. `Preserve log` can also be useful (it saves the logs printed by the application when the page is reloaded) as well as `Hide extension URLs` (hides requests of any extensions installed in the browser, not shown in the picture above).

**NB:** The most important tab is the `Console` tab. However, in this introduction, we will be using the `Network` tab quite a bit.
