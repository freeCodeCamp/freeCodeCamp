# --description--

The server and the web browser communicate with each other using the HTTP protocol. The `Network` tab shows how the browser and the server communicate.

When you reload the page (to refresh a webpage, on Windows, press the `F5` keys. On macOS, press `command-R`. Or press the `â†»` symbol on your browser), the console will show that two events have happened:

- The browser has fetched the contents of the page `studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp` from the server

- And has downloaded the image `kuva.png`

On a small screen, you might have to widen the console window to see these.

Clicking the first event reveals more information on what's happening:

The upper part, `General`, shows that the browser requested the address `https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp` (though the address has changed slightly since this picture was taken) using the [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) method, and that the request was successful, because the server response had the [Status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) 200.

The request and the server response have several headers:

The `Response headers` on top tell us things like the size of the response in bytes and the exact time of the response. An important header [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) tells us that the response is a text file in [`utf-8`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) format and the contents of which have been formatted with HTML. This way the browser knows the response to be a regular [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) page and to render it to the browser "like a web page".

The `Response` tab shows the response data, a regular HTML page. The body section determines the structure of the page rendered to the screen:

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/full-stack-open/part-0-b/http-get-5.png" alt="Network tab showing response data of a request">

The page contains a [div](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/div) element, which in turn contains a heading, a link to the page notes, and an [img](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img) tag, and displays the number of notes created.

Because of the [img](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/img) tag, the browser does a second `HTTP` request to fetch the image `kuva.png` from the server. The details of the request are as follows:

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/full-stack-open/part-0-b/http-get-6.png" alt="Network tab showing details of a request for an image">

The request was made to the address `https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/kuva.png` and its type is `HTTP GET`. The response headers tell us that the response size is 89350 bytes, and its `Content-Type` is `image/png`, so it is a PNG image. The browser uses this information to render the image correctly to the screen.

The chain of events caused by opening the page `https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp` on a browser forms the following sequence diagram:

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/full-stack-open/part-0-b/http-get-7.png" alt="Sequence diagram of HTTP GET requests">

The sequence diagram visualizes how the browser and server are communicating over time. The time flows in the diagram from top to bottom, so the diagram starts with the first request that the browser sends to the server, followed by the response.

First, the browser sends an `HTTP GET` request to the server to fetch the HTML code of the page. The img tag in the HTML prompts the browser to fetch the image kuva.png. The browser renders the HTML page and the image to the screen.

Even though it is difficult to notice, the HTML page begins to render before the image has been fetched from the server.


# --questions--

## --text--

When the browser loads `https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp`, which type of response header tells the browser how to interpret and render the response data?

## --answers--

`Content-Type`

---

`Status Code`

### --feedback--

The status code only tells whether the request succeeded (e.g., 200 OK), not how to render the content.

---

`Content-Length`

### --feedback--

This tells the size of the response in bytes, not its format.

---

`Date`

### --feedback--

This shows the exact time of the response, but not how to interpret the contents.
