<!-- (Audio) speaker: sh, sha, she, shu, shē, shé, shě, shè -->

# --description--

To pronounce `sh`, curl the tip of your tongue up and back toward the hard palate, creating a wide but narrow channel. Allow air to flow continuously through this space, producing a steady, soft friction sound without any stop or burst.

When `sh` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `sha`, `she`, and `shu`.

Let's practice pronouncing `she` with different tones. The video will show example characters for each one.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initials and syllables.
