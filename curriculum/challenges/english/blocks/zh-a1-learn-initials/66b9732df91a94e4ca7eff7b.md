<!-- (Audio) speaker: sh, sha, she, shu, shē, shé, shě, shè -->

# --description--

To pronounce `sh`, curl the tip of your tongue up and back toward the hard palate, creating a wide but narrow channel. Allow air to flow continuously through this space, producing a steady, soft friction sound without any stop or burst.

When `sh` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `sha`, `she`, and `shu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `she` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `shē`  | `奢`|
| `shé`   | `舌`|
| `shě`  | `舍`|
| `shè`  | `射`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
