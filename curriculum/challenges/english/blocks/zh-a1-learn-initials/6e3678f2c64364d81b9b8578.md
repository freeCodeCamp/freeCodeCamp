<!-- (Audio) Wang Hua: k, ka, ke, ku, kē, ké, kě, kè -->

# --description--

The initial `k` is pronounced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate, just similar to `g`. But unlike `g`, `k` is aspirated. When you release it, there is a strong puff of air.

Try saying `k` and feel a strong puff of air hit your hand if you hold it in front of your mouth. Then, try the same with `g` and you should feel almost no air. 

When `k` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ka`, `ke`, and `ku`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `ke` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `kē`  | `稞`|
| `ké`   | `咳`|
| `kě`  | `可`|
| `kè`  | `刻`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
