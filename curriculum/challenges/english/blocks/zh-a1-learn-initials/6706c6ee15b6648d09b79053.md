<!-- (Audio) speaker: p, pa, po, pi, pu, pō, pó, pǒ, pò --> 

# --description--

To pronounce the initial `p`, firmly press your lips together and then release them with a quick, strong burst of air. This puff of air is what makes `p` different from `b`, which uses the same lip position but releases the sound gently without pushing out air.

It should feel like a small explosion at your lips, with clear airflow that you can feel if you hold your hand in front of your mouth while saying it.

As mentioned earlier, you might sometimes hear this initial pronounced as `po`. Adding the single final `o` makes it easier to hear and pronounce clearly.

When `p` combines with the finals `a`, `o`, `i`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `pa`, `po`, `pi`, and `pu`.

Similar to `b`, when pronouncing these syllables, smoothly link the `p` sound directly into the finals without pausing between them. The only difference will be the mouth shape you make for each specific final.

Let's practice pronouncing `po` with different tones.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initials and syllables.
