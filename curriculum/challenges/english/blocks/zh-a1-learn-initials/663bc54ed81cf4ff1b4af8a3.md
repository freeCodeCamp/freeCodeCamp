<!-- (Audio) speaker: ch, cha, che, chu, chā, chá, chǎ, chà -->

# --description--

To pronounce `ch`, place your tongue in the same curled-back position as for `zh`, with the tip lifted toward the hard palate. Build up a small amount of air pressure behind the tongue. Release the air with a noticeable burst, creating an aspirated sound that begins with a clear puff of air and then continues briefly with friction.

When `ch` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `cha`, `che`, and `chu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `cha` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `chā`  | `插`|
| `chá`   | `茶`|
| `chǎ`  | `叉`|
| `chà`  | `刹`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
