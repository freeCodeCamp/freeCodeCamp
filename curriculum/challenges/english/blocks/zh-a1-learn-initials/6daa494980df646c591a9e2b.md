<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: n, na, ne, ni, nu, nü -->

# --description--

The initial `n` is a nasal sound. To pronounce it, place the tip of your tongue against the ridge behind your upper front teeth. Let the air pass through your nose, not your mouth. Unlike mouth sounds like `d` or `t`, you'll feel a subtle vibration in your nose as you hum this sound.

When `n` combines with finals `a`, `e`, `i`, `u`, and `ü`, you get the syllables: `na`, `ne`, `ni`, `nu`, and `nü`.

This is your first time seeing a final with `ü`. Only a few initials can combine with `ü`, and `n` and `l` are two of them.
