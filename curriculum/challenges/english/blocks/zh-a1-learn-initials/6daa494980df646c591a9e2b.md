<!-- (Audio) speaker: n, na, ne, ni, nu, nü, ní, nǐ, nì -->

# --description--

The initial `n` is a nasal sound. To pronounce it, place the tip of your tongue against the ridge behind your upper front teeth. Let the air pass through your nose, not your mouth. Unlike mouth sounds like `d` or `t`, you'll feel a subtle vibration in your nose as you hum this sound.

When `n` combines with finals `a`, `e`, `i`, `u`, and `ü`, you get the syllables: `na`, `ne`, `ni`, `nu`, and `nü`.

This is your first time seeing a initial with `ü`. Only a few initials can combine with `ü`, and `n` and `l` are two of them.

Let's practice pronouncing `n` and syllables, and then use `ni` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `ní`  | `泥`|
| `nǐ`   | `你`|
| `nì`  | `腻`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
