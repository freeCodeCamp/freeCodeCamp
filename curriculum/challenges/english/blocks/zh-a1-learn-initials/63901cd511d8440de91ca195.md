<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: b, ba, bo, bi, bu -->

# --description--

You know a Pinyin syllable has three parts: initial, final, and tone. You have already learned the finals and tones. Now you'll focus on initials and practice combining them with finals to form syllables.

There are 21 initials in total. You'll learn them in groups by mouth position to make pronunciation easier. The first group is `b`, `p`, `m`, `f`.

The very first initial you learn here is `b`. To pronounce the `b`, gently press your lips together and then release them while making a short, soft sound without a strong puff of air and without vibration in your vocal cords. It should feel quick and smooth, as your lips come together and part gently.

When `b` is combined with the finals `a`, `o`, `i`, `u`, you get the syllables: `ba`, `bo`, `bi`, `bu`.

To pronounce `ba`, begin by putting your lips together to pronounce the `b` sound. Immediately after, open your mouth wide into a relaxed and open shape to pronounce the clear `a` vowel. The key is to connect the consonant and the vowel in one fluid motion without pausing between them. You can use this same method of smoothly linking the `b` sound directly into the vowel for other syllables like `bo`, `bi`, and `bu`. The only difference will be the mouth shape you make for each specific vowel.
