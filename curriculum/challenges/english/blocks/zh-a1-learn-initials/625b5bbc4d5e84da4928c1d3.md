<!-- (Audio) speaker: zh, zha, zhe, zhu, zhū, zhú, zhǔ, zhù -->

# --description--

To pronounce `zh`, curl the tip of your tongue upward and back until it presses against the hard palate, blocking the airflow completely. Then, release the tongue slightly to create a narrow channel.​ Expel the air through this channel without a strong puff​ to produce a firm, buzzing sound that begins instantly.

When `zh` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `zha`, `zhe`, and `zhu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `zhu` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

in different tonesI've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
