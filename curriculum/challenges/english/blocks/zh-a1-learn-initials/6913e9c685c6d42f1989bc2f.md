<!-- (Audio) speaker: j, ji, ju, jū, jú, jǔ, jù -->

# --description--

To pronounce `j`, raise the front of your tongue to press against the hard palate. The tip of your tongue should point down, behind your bottom teeth. Build up a little air pressure, then release it gently to make a soft, unaspirated sound. 

When `j` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `ji` and `ju`. Note that `ü` is written as `u` after `j`.

Let's practice pronouncing `ju` with different tones. The video will show example characters for each one.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initials and syllables.
