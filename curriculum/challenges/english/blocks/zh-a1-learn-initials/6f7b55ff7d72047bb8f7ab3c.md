<!-- (Audio) speaker: s, sa, se, su, sā, sǎ, sà -->

# --description--

To pronounce `s`, put the tip of your tongue close to the back of your upper front teeth, leaving a narrow gap. Let the air flow out continuously​ to make a steady, hissing sound, like a snake.

When `s` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `sa`, `se`, and `su`.

Let's practice pronouncing `sa` with different tones.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initials and syllables.
