<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: s, sa, se, su -->

# --description--

The initial `s` is pronounced by placing the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper front teeth. It's similar to the English "s" sound in "see" or "sun".

When `s` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `sa`, `se`, and `su`.
