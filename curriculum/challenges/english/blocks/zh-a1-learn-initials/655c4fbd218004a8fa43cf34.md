<!-- (Audio) speaker: h, ha, he, hu, hē, hé, hè -->

# --description--

The initial `h` is pronounced by exhaling air through your throat, creating a soft friction sound.

When `h` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ha`, `he`, and `hu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `he` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

in different tonesI've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
