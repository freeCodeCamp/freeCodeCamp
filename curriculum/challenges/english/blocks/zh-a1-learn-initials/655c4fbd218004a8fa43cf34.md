<!-- (Audio) Wang Hua: h, ha, he, hu, hē, hé, hè -->

# --description--

The initial `h` is pronounced by exhaling air through your throat, creating a soft friction sound.

When `h` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ha`, `he`, and `hu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `he` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `hē`  | `喝`|
| `hé`   | `合`|
| `hè`  | `褐`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
