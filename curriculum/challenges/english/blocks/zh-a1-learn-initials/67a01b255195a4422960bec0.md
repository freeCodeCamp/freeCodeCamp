<!-- (Audio) speaker: m, ma, mo, mi, mu, mī, mí, mǐ, mì -->

# --description--

`m` is a nasal sound. To pronounce it, gently press your lips together like you're about to say `b`, but instead of opening them, keep them closed and let the sound come out through your nose while making a soft humming sound in your throat.

It should feel like when you hum a song with your mouth closed, producing a smooth, continuous nasal sound without any air escaping through your lips.

You might sometimes hear `m` pronounced as `mo`. It's because adding the single final `o` makes this initial easier to hear.

When `m` combines with the finals `a`, `o`, `i`, and `u`, you get syllables: `ma`, `mo`, `mi`, and `mu`.

Similar to `b`, when pronouncing these syllables, smoothly link the `m` sound directly into the final without pausing between them. The only difference will be the mouth shape you make for each specific final.

Let's practice pronouncing `m` and the syllables, and then use `mi` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `mī`   |  `眯`|
| `mí`  | `迷`|
| `mǐ`   | `米`|
| `mì`  | `蜜`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
