<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: m, ma, mo, mi, mu -->

# --description--

`m` is a nasal sound. To pronounce it, gently press your lips together like you're about to say `b`, but instead of opening them, keep them closed and let the sound come out through your nose while making a soft humming sound in your throat.

It should feel like when you hum a song with your mouth closed, producing a smooth, continuous nasal sound without any air escaping through your lips.

When `m` combines with the finals `a`, `o`, `i`, and `u`, you get syllables: `ma`, `mo`, `mi`, and `mu`.

Similar to `b`, when pronouncing these syllables, smoothly link the `m` sound directly into the vowel sound without pausing between them. The only difference will be the mouth shape you make for each specific vowel.
