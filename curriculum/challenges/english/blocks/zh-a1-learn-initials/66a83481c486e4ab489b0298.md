<!-- (Audio) speaker: g, ga, ge, gu, gē, gé, gě, gè -->

# --description--

The initial `g` is pronounced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate. To practice, try saying `g` and you should feel almost no air hit your hand if you hold it in front of your mouth.

When `g` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ga`, `ge`, and `gu`.

Let's practice pronouncing `ge` with different tones. The video will show example characters for each one.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initials and syllables.
