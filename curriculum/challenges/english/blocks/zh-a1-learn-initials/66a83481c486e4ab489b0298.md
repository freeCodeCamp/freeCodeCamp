<!-- (Audio) Wang Hua: g, ga, ge, gu, gē, gé, gě, gè -->

# --description--

The initial `g` is pronounced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate. To practice, try saying `g` and you should feel almost no air hit your hand if you hold it in front of your mouth.

When `g` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ga`, `ge`, and `gu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `ge` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `gē`  | `哥`|
| `gé`   | `格`|
| `gě`  | `葛`|
| `gè`  | `个`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
