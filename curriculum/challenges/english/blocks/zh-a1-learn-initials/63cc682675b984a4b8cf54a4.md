<!-- (Audio) speaker: c, ca, ce, cū, cú, cù -->

# --description--

To pronounce `c`, start by building up pressure with your tongue tip behind your upper teeth. Release it suddenly with a sharp, explosive puff of air.

When `c` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ca`, `ce`, and `cu`.

LLet's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `cu` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `cū`  | `粗`|
| `cú`   | `徂`|
| `cù`  | `促`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
