<!-- (Audio) speaker: c, ca, ce, cā, cè, cū -->

# --description--

To pronounce `c`, start by building up pressure with your tongue tip behind your upper teeth. Release it suddenly with a sharp, explosive puff of air.

When `c` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ca`, `ce`, and `cu`.

Let's practice pronouncing some syllables with different tones.

# --assignment--

in different tonesI've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
