<!-- (Audio) speaker: z, za, ze, zu, zū, zú, zǔ -->

# --description--

The initial `z` is pronounced by putting the tip of your tongue behind your upper front teeth to build up a little air pressure, then quickly moving your tongue away to make a short, buzzing sound. No strong air puff.

When `z` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `za`, `ze`, and `zu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `zu` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

in different tonesI've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
