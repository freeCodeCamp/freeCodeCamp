<!-- (Audio) speaker: x, xi, xu, xū, xú, xǔ, xù -->

# --description--

To pronounce `x`, the front of your tongue comes close to the hard palate, but don't press firmly, instead, leave a narrow gap. Let the air flow out continuously​ to make a steady, soft hissing sound.

When `x` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `xi` and `xu`. Note that `ü` is written as `u` after `x`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `xu` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `xū`  | `须`|
| `xú`   | `徐`|
| `xǔ`  | `许`|
| `xù`  | `序`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
