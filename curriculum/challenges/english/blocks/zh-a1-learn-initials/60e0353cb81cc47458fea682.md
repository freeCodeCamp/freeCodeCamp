<!-- (Audio) speaker: x, xi, xu, xū, xú, xǔ, xù -->

# --description--

To pronounce `x`, the front of your tongue comes close to the hard palate, but don't press firmly, instead, leave a narrow gap. Let the air flow out continuously​ to make a steady, soft hissing sound.

When `x` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `xi` and `xu`. Note that `ü` is written as `u` after `x`.

Let's practice pronouncing `xu` with different tones. The video will show example characters for each one.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initials and syllables.
