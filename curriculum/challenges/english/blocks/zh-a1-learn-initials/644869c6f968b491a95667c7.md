This word is made from two syllables: `dú` and `lì`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable uses the initial `d` with the simple final `u`, and takes the second tone. The second syllable uses the initial `l` with the simple final `i`, and takes the fourth tone.

`独立 (dú lì)` means to do things by yourself, without help from others.
