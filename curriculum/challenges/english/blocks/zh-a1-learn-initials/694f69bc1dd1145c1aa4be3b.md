<!-- (Audio) speaker: q, qi, qu, qī, qí, qǐ, qì -->

# --description--

To pronounce `q`, press the front of your tongue firmly against your hard palate, then release the air with a quick, forceful burst.

When `q` combines with the finals `i`, and `ü`, you get the syllables: `qi` and `qu`. Note that `ü` is written as `u` after `q`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `qi` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `qī`  | `期`|
| `qí`   | `齐`|
| `qǐ`  | `起`|
| `qì`  | `气`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
