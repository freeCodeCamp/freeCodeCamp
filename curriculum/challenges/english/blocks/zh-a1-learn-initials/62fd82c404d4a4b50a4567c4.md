<!-- (Audio) speaker: f, fa, fo, fu, fū, fú, fǔ, fù -->

# --description--

`f` is a sound made with your lips and teeth. To pronounce `f`, gently place your upper teeth against your lower lip and let air flow smoothly between them.

Unlike `b` and `p` where your lips press together completely, for `f` your lips never fully close as you make this soft, continuous sound by steadily exhaling through the small space between your teeth and lower lip.

You might sometimes hear this initial pronounced as `fo`. It's because adding the single final `o` makes this initial easier to hear.

When `f` combines with the finals `a`, `o`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `fa`, `fo`, and `fu`.

Similar to `b` and `p`, when pronouncing these syllables, smoothly link the `f` sound directly into the final without pausing between them. The only difference will be the mouth shape you make for each specific final.

Let's practice pronouncing `f` and the syllables, and then use `fu` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `fū`   |  `夫`|
| `fú`  | `芙`|
| `fǔ`   | `抚`|
| `fù`  | `父`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the initial and syllables.
