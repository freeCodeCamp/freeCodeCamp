<!-- (Audio) Wang Hua: 批复 (pī fù) -->

# --description--

You have learned the first group of initials, `b`, `p`, `m`, and `f`. Now you will see how these initials combine with the simple finals you learned earlier to form Pinyin and produce Chinese characters.

If you type the correct Pinyin with a number for the tone, the Pinyin-to-Hanzi Input will convert it to characters.

At this stage, you do not need to worry about understanding the meaning of the characters. The goal is simply to experience how Pinyin helps you input and recognize them.

Remember to expand the explanation section to check the meaning of the word if you are curious.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the word below. The correct syllables will be converted to Chinese characters.

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`批复 (pī fù)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `pī` and `fù`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `p` with the final `i`, and uses the first tone, which is a high and level. The second syllable combines the initial `f` with the final `u`, and uses the fourth tone, which falls sharply.

`批复 (pī fù)` means "to reply officially". It is often used in work or government contexts, for example when a request or document receives an official response.
