## --blanks--

`继续 (jì xù)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `jì` and `xù`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable uses the initial `j` with the simple final `i`, and takes the fourth tone. The second syllable uses the initial `x` with the final `ü` (written as `u` after `x`), and also takes the fourth tone.

`继续 (jì xù)` means to continue or to keep going. It is often used when an action or activity does not stop.
