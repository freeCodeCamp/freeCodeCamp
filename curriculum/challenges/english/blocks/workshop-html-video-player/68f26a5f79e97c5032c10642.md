We will use the `type` attribute to specify the MIME type of the media file.

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a standard to describe documents
in other forms besides ASCII text, for example, audio, video, and images.

MP4, formally known as MPEG-4 Part 14, is a digital multimedia container format.
It is widely used for storing video and audio, but it can also include other data types
like subtitles and still images. MP4 files are designed for streaming over the Internet
and are compatible with many devices and platforms.

Now, add the `type` attribute and the value `video/mp4`.
