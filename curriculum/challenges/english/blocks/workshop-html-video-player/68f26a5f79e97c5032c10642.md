# --description--

We will use the `type` attribute to specify the
[MIME](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME) type of the media file.
MP4, formally known as MPEG-4 Part 14, is a digital multimedia container format. 
It is widely used for storing video and audio, but it can also include other data types
like subtitles and still images. MP4 files are designed for streaming over the Internet
and are compatible with many devices and platforms.

Now, add the `type` attribute and the value `video/mp4`
