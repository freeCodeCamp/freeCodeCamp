# --description--

You might have noticed we didn't link to the actual video.
We will do that in the next phase. When it comes to video file types,
there are differences in browser support. To accommodate this, you can
use `source` elements inside the `video` element and the browser will select
the first compatible `source`.

The source element is a void element, like the `img` element, so it contains no content. 
Do not use a closing tag.

Now, create a `source` element. Don't put anything in it yet.
Remember to self-close it.
