Congratulation! You have completed the HTML Video Player Workshop.
You learned how to create a HTML5 video player for users to consume
video content. You learned about working with different video
formats such as MP4, WebM, and Ogg. You learned it's important to offer
different formats, so everyone can access your content.
Use your new found knowledge to complete the upcoming
HTML Audio and Video Player lab.

Good Luck and Keep Learning!
