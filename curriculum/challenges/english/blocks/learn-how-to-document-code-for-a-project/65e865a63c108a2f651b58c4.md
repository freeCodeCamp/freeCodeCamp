<!-- (Audio) Brian: Then specify how to run the code and any other essential setup instructions. -->

# --description--

In this task, you'll learn the difference between `specific` and `specify.` `Specific` is an adjective that describes something clearly defined or detailed, while `specify` is a verb meaning to state something in detail.

For example, a `specific` instruction might be `use port 8080,` while to `specify` can mean to state that detail: `specify the port number.`

`Setup` refers to the arrangement or preparation of something, often used in the context of preparing software or equipment, like `setup instructions for the software.`
