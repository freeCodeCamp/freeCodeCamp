<!-- (Audio) Brian: You should also reference issues in your commit messages if you're working on a task related to an issue. It helps in tracking progress and understanding the context of changes. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

When should Sophie reference issues in her commit messages, and why?

## --answers--

When working on any task, to make the messages longer

### --feedback--

The focus isn't on making messages longer but on providing specific information for tasks related to an issue.

---

When working on tasks related to an issue, to help track progress and understand changes

---

Always, in every task she works

### --feedback--

Brian specifically mentions referencing issues when the task is related to one, not always.

---

When she completes a task, to show she has finished it

### --feedback--

Referencing issues is meant for context and tracking progress, not just to indicate task completion.
