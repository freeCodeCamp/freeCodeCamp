# --description--

In this task, you'll learn about phrases like `Did you get it?`, `Got it,` and `What else?` These phrases are common in English conversations. `Did you get it?` is a question asking if someone understood something. `Got it` is a short way of saying `I understood.` `What else?` is used to ask for additional information or items.
