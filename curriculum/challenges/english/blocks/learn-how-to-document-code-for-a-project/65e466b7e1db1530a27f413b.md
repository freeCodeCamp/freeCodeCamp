# --description--

In computer file systems, `root directory` refers to the main or top-level directory. It's like the top drawer of a filing cabinet, containing all other folders and files.

A `main folder` is the primary folder in which a project or a set of files is stored.

A `subfolder` is like a smaller drawer inside the top one, located within another folder.

For example, in a project called `MyProject`, the `root directory` would be the `MyProject` folder, and any folder inside it, like `Images`, would be a `subfolder`.
