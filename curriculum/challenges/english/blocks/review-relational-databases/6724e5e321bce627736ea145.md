## Terminal, Shell, and Command Line Basics

- **Command line**: A text interface where users type commands.  
- **Terminal**: The application that provides access to the command line.  
- **Terminal emulator**: Adds extra features to a terminal.  
- **Shell**: Interprets the commands entered into the terminal (e.g., Bash).  
- **PowerShell / Command Prompt / Microsoft Terminal**: Options for accessing the command line on Windows.  
- **Terminal (macOS)**: Built-in option on macOS, with third-party alternatives like iTerm or Ghostty.  
- **Terminal (Linux)**: Options vary by distribution, with many third-party emulators like kitty.  
- **Terminology**: Though "terminal," "shell," and "command line" are often used interchangeably, they have specific meanings.  


## Command Line Shortcuts

- **Up/Down arrows**: Cycle through previous/next commands in history.
- **Tab**: Autocomplete commands.
- **`Control+L`** (Linux/macOS) or typing `cls` (Windows): Clear the terminal screen.
- **`Control+C`**: Interrupt a running command (also used for copying in PowerShell if text is selected).
- **`Control+Z`** (Linux/macOS only): Suspend a task to the background; use `fg` to resume it.
- **`!!`**: Instantly rerun the last executed command.

## Bash Basics

- **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell): Widely used Unix-like shell.  
  Key commands:

  - **`pwd`**: Show the current directory.
  - **`cd`**: Change directories.
    - **`..`** refers to the parent directory (one level up).
    - **`.`** refers to the current directory.
  - **`ls`**: List files and folders.
    - **`-a`**: Show all files, including hidden files.
    - **`-l`**: Show detailed information about files.
  - **`less`**: View file contents one page at a time with navigation options, including scrolling backward and searching.
  - **`more`**: Display file contents one screen at a time, with limited backward scrolling and basic navigation.
  - **`cat`**: Show the entire file content at once without scrolling or navigation, useful for smaller files.
  - **`mkdir`**: Create a new directory.
  - **`rmdir`**: Remove an empty directory.
  - **`touch`**: Create a new file.
  - **`mv`**: Move or rename files.
    - Rename: `mv oldname.txt newname.txt`
    - Move: `mv filename.txt /path/to/target/`
  - **`cp`**: Copy files.
    - **`-r`**: Recursively copy directories and their contents.
  - **`rm`**: Delete files.
    - **`-r`**: Recursively delete directories and their contents.
  - **`echo`**: Display a line of text or a variable's value.
    - Use `>>` to append output to a file **without overwriting existing content** (e.g., `echo "text" >> file.txt`).
  - **`exit`**: Exit the terminal session.
  - **`clear`**: Clear the terminal screen.
  - **`find`**: Search for files and directories.
    - **`-name`**: Search for files by name pattern (e.g., `find . -name "*.txt"`).
  - Use **`man`** followed by a command (e.g., `man ls`) to access detailed manual/help pages.

## Command Options and Flags

- **Options** or **flags**: modify a command's behavior and are usually prefixed with hyphens:
  - **Long form (two hyphens)**:  
    - Example: `--help`, `--version`
    - Values are attached using an equals sign, e.g., `--width=50`.
  - **Short form (one hyphen)**:  
    - Example: `-a`, `-l`
    - Values are passed with a space, e.g., `-w 50`.
    - Multiple short options can be chained together, e.g., `ls -alh`.
- **`--help`**: You can always use a command with this flag to understand the available options for any command.

## Introduction to Relational Databases

- **Relational Databases**: Organize data into related tables made of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of the data.
- **Advantages of Relational Databases**: Scalable, widely applicable across domains (e.g., healthcare, business, gaming), and structured to maintain reliable data.
- **Common Use Cases**: Web development, inventory systems, e-commerce, healthcare, and enterprise applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Schema**: A relational database requires a schema that defines its structureâ€”tables, columns, data types, constraints, and relationships.
- **Primary Keys**: Unique identifiers for each row in a table. They are essential for data integrity and are used to relate records between tables via foreign keys.
- **Foreign Keys**: References to primary keys in another table, used to link related data across tables.
- **Relationships**: By connecting tables through primary and foreign keys, you can structure normalized data and perform meaningful queries.
- **Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**: Visualize how entities (tables) relate to each other in a database schema.
- **Data Integrity**: Enforced using keys and data types. Ensures consistency and accuracy of stored data.

## SQL Basics

- **Queries**: Requests to retrieve specific data from the database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM dogs WHERE age < 3;
```

- **WHERE clause**: Filter results based on conditions. Use comparison operators like `<`, `=`, `>`, etc.
- **Select with ORDER BY**: Retrieve and sort results based on a column.

```sql
SELECT columns FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name;
```

## Table Operations

- **`CREATE TABLE` Statement**: This statement is used to create a new table in a database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE first_table();
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` Statement**: This statement is used to add a column to an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE;
```

- **`ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` Statement**: This statement is used to drop a column from an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP COLUMN column_name;
```

- **`ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN` Statement**: This statement is used to rename a column in a table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME COLUMN column_name TO new_name;
```

- **`DROP TABLE` Statement**: This statement is used to drop an entire table from the database.

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

- **`ALTER DATABASE RENAME` Statement**: This statement is used to rename a database.

```sql
ALTER DATABASE database_name RENAME TO new_database_name;
```

- **`DROP DATABASE` Statement**: This statement is used to drop an entire database.

```sql
DROP DATABASE database_name;
```

## Constraints & Data Integrity

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with Constraint**: This statement is used to add a column with a constraint to an existing table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE CONSTRAINT;
```

- **`NOT NULL` Constraint**: This constraint ensures that a column cannot have NULL values.

```sql
column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD PRIMARY KEY` Statement**: This statement is used to add a primary key constraint to a table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with Foreign Key**: This statement is used to add a foreign key column that references another table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN column_name DATATYPE REFERENCES referenced_table_name(referenced_column_name);
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ADD UNIQUE` Statement**: This statement is used to add a UNIQUE constraint to a column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUE(column_name);
```

- **`ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL` Statement**: This statement is used to set a NOT NULL constraint on an existing column.

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ALTER COLUMN column_name SET NOT NULL;
```

- **`INSERT` Statement with NULL Values**: This statement demonstrates how to insert NULL values into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_a) VALUES(NULL);
-- or
INSERT INTO table_name(column_b) VALUES('value'); -- if column_a allows nulls
```

- **Composite Primary Key**: This constraint defines a primary key that consists of multiple columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE course_enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

## Data Manipulation (CRUD)

- **`INSERT` Statement**: This statement is used to insert a single row into a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name(column_1, column_2) VALUES(value1, value2);
```

- **`INSERT` Statement with Omitted Columns**: This statement shows how to insert values without explicitly listing the column names, relying on the default column order in the table.

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs VALUES ('Gino', 3);
```

- **`INSERT` Statement with Multiple Rows**: This statement is used to insert multiple rows into a table in a single operation.

```sql
INSERT INTO dogs (name, age) VALUES 
('Gino', 3),
('Nora', 2);
```

- **`UPDATE` Statement**: This statement is used to update existing data in a table based on a condition.

```sql
price NUMERIC(10, 2)
```

- **`TEXT` Data Type**: This data type is used to store variable-length character strings with no specific length limit.

```sql
column_name TEXT
```

- **`INTEGER` Data Type**: This data type is used to store whole numbers without decimal places.

```sql

```

## Database Relationships

- **Types of Relationships**: These are the different ways tables can be related to each other in a relational database.
  - One-to-one
  - One-to-many
  - Many-to-one
  - Many-to-many
  - Self-referencing (recursive)

- **One-to-One Relationship**: This relationship type means that each record in one table corresponds to exactly one record in another table.

```md
One employee is assigned exactly one vehicle.
Tables: employees, vehicles
```

- **One-to-Many Relationship**: This relationship type means that one record in a table can be associated with multiple records in another table.

```md
One customer can have many orders.
Tables: customers â†’ orders
```

- **Many-to-Many Relationship via Junction Table**: This relationship type is implemented using a junction table that contains foreign keys from both related tables.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books_authors (
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(id)
);
```

- **Self-Referencing Relationships**: This relationship type occurs when a table references itself, creating a hierarchical structure.

```md
An employee table where each employee may report to another employee.
```

## Advanced SQL (Joins)

- **`INNER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
INNER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`FULL OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from both tables, including unmatched rows from either table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
FULL OUTER JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`LEFT OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
LEFT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`RIGHT OUTER JOIN` Statement**: This join returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
RIGHT JOIN sales ON products.product_id = sales.product_id;
```

- **`SELF JOIN` Statement**: This join is used to join a table with itself to compare rows within the same table.

```sql
SELECT A.column_name, B.column_name
FROM table_name A
JOIN table_name B ON A.related_column = B.related_column;
```

- **`CROSS JOIN` Statement**: This join returns the Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

## PostgreSQL Specific Commands

- **`psql` Login Command**: This command is used to log in to PostgreSQL with specific username and database.

```bash
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres
```

- **`\l` Command**: This command lists all databases in the PostgreSQL instance.

```sql
\l
```

- **`CREATE DATABASE` and `\c` Commands**: These commands are used to create a new database and connect to it.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
\c database_name
```

- **`\d` Command**: This command lists all tables in the current database.

```sql
\d
```

- **`\d table_name` Command**: This command displays the schema/structure of a specific table.

```sql
\d table_name
```

- **`\q` Command**: This command exits the PostgreSQL client.

```bash
\q
```

## Relational vs Non-Relational

- **Non-Relational (NoSQL) Databases**: Store unstructured or semi-structured data. Do not require a rigid schema and are more flexible for evolving data models.
- **Choosing Between Relational and Non-Relational**: Depends on the nature of your data and application requirements.
- **Relational vs Non-Relational**: Choose relational for structured data and consistency; NoSQL for flexibility and fast-changing data.

## Popular RDBMS Systems

- **MySQL**: Open-source, reliable, widely used in web development, supported by a large community.
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source, advanced, extensible. Supports custom data types and server-side programming.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, file-based, serverless. Ideal for small applications.
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: Proprietary, enterprise-grade database.
- **Oracle Database**: Commercial RDBMS known for large-scale performance and scalability.

## Best Practices

- **Naming Convention**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `delivery_orders`) for table and column names.

## Bash Scripting Basics

- **Bash scripting**: Writing a sequence of Bash commands in a file, which you can then execute with Bash to run the contents of the file.
- **Shebang**: The commented line at the beginning of a script (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`) that indicates what interpreter should be used for the script.

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  ```

- **Variable assignment**: Instantiate variables using the syntax `variable_name=value`.

  ```bash
  servers=("prod" "dev")
  ```

- **Variable creation rules**: Create variables with `VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE` syntax. No spaces are allowed around the equal sign (`=`). Use double quotes if the value contains spaces.

  ```bash
  NAME=John
  MESSAGE="Hello World"
  COUNT=5
  TEXT="The next number is, "
  ```

- **Variable usage**: Access variable values by placing `$` in front of the variable name.

  ```bash
  echo $NAME
  echo "The message is: $MESSAGE"
  ```

- **Variable interpolation**: Use `$variable_name` to access the value of a variable within strings and commands.

  ```bash
  TEXT="The next number is, "
  NUMBER=42
  echo $TEXT B:$NUMBER
  echo $TEXT I:$NUMBER
  
  echo "Pulling $server"
  rsync --archive --verbose $server:/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf configs/$server.conf
  ```

- **Variable scope**: Shell scripts run from top to bottom, so variables can only be used below where they are created.

  ```bash
  NAME="Alice"
  echo $NAME
  ```

- **User input**: Use `read` to accept input from users and store it in a variable.

  ```bash
  read USERNAME
  echo "Hello $USERNAME"
  ```

- **Comments**: Add comments to your scripts using `#` followed by your comment text.
  - Single-line comments start with `#` and continue to the end of the line
  - Comments are ignored by the shell and don't affect script execution

  ```bash
  # This is a single-line comment
  NAME="John"  # Comment at end of line
  ```

- **Multi-line comments**: Comment out blocks of code using colon and quotes.

  ```bash
  : '
  This is a multi-line comment
  Everything between the quotes is ignored
  Useful for debugging or documentation
  '
  ```

- **Built-in commands and help**: 
  - Use `help` to see a list of built-in bash commands
  - Use `help <command>` to get information about specific built-in commands
  - Some commands (like `if`) are built-ins and don't have man pages
  - Built-in commands are executed directly by the shell rather than as external programs
  - Use `help function` to see information about creating functions

  ```bash
  help
  help if
  help function
  ```

- **Finding command locations**: Use `which` to locate where executables are installed.
  - Shows the full path to executable files
  - Useful for finding interpreter locations (like bash)
  - Helps verify which version of a command will be executed

  ```bash
  which bash
  which python
  which ls
  ```

- **Manual pages**: Use `man` to access detailed documentation for commands.
  - Provides comprehensive information about command usage
  - Shows all available options and examples
  - Use arrow keys to navigate, 'q' to quit
  - Not all commands have manual pages (built-ins use `help` instead)

  ```bash
  man echo
  man ls
  man bash
  ```

- **Help flags**: Many commands support `--help` for quick help information.
  - Alternative to manual pages for quick reference
  - Shows command syntax and common options
  - Not all commands support this flag (some may show error)

  ```bash
  ls --help
  chmod --help
  mv --help
  ```

- **Echo command options**: The `echo` command supports various options:
  - `-e` option enables interpretation of backslash escapes
  - `\n` creates a new line
  - Empty lines are only printed when values are enclosed in quotes
  - Useful for creating formatted output and program titles

  ```bash
  echo -e "Line 1\nLine 2"
  echo ""
  echo -e "\n~~ Program Title ~~\n"
  echo "Line 1\nLine 2"
  ```

- **Script arguments**: Programs can accept arguments that are accessible using `$` variables.
  - `$*` prints all arguments passed to the script
  - `$@` prints all arguments passed to the script as separate quoted strings
  - `$<number>` accesses specific arguments by position (e.g., `$1`, `$2`, `$3`)

  ```bash
  echo $*
  echo $@
  echo $1
  echo $2
  ```

## Double Bracket Expressions `[[ ]]`

- **Double bracket syntax**: Use `[[ ]]` for conditional testing and pattern matching.
  - Must have spaces inside the brackets and around operators
  - Returns exit status 0 (true) or 1 (false) based on the test result

  ```bash
  [[ $variable == "value" ]]
  [[ $number -gt 10 ]]
  [[ -f filename.txt ]]
  ```

- **String comparison operators**: Compare strings using various operators within `[[ ]]`.
  - `==` (equal): Tests if two strings are identical
  - `!=` (not equal): Tests if two strings are different
  - `<` (lexicographically less): String comparison in alphabetical order
  - `>` (lexicographically greater): String comparison in alphabetical order

  ```bash
  [[ "apple" == "apple" ]]
  [[ "apple" != "orange" ]]
  [[ "apple" < "banana" ]]
  [[ "zebra" > "apple" ]]
  ```

- **Numeric comparison operators**: Compare numbers using specific numeric operators.
  - `-eq` (equal): Numeric equality comparison
  - `-ne` (not equal): Numeric inequality comparison
  - `-lt` (less than): Numeric less than comparison
  - `-le` (less than or equal): Numeric less than or equal comparison
  - `-gt` (greater than): Numeric greater than comparison
  - `-ge` (greater than or equal): Numeric greater than or equal comparison

  ```bash
  [[ $number -eq 5 ]]
  [[ $count -ne 0 ]]
  [[ $age -ge 18 ]]
  [[ $score -lt 100 ]]
  ```

- **Logical operators**: Combine multiple conditions using logical operators.
  - `&&` (and): Both conditions must be true
  - `||` (or): At least one condition must be true
  - `!` (not): Negates the condition (makes true false, false true)

  ```bash
  [[ $age -ge 18 && $age -le 65 ]]
  [[ $name == "John" || $name == "Jane" ]]
  [[ ! -f missing_file.txt ]]
  ```

- **File test operators**: Test file properties and existence.
  - `-e file`: True if file exists
  - `-f file`: True if file exists and is a regular file
  - `-d file`: True if file exists and is a directory
  - `-r file`: True if file exists and is readable
  - `-w file`: True if file exists and is writable
  - `-x file`: True if file exists and is executable
  - `-s file`: True if file exists and has size greater than zero

  ```bash
  [[ -e /path/to/file ]]
  [[ -f script.sh ]]
  [[ -d /home/user ]]
  [[ -x program ]]
  ```

- **Pattern matching with `=~`**: Use regular expressions for advanced pattern matching.
  - `=~` operator enables regex pattern matching
  - Pattern should not be quoted when using regex metacharacters
  - Supports full regular expression syntax
  - Case-sensitive by default

  ```bash
  [[ "hello123" =~ [0-9]+ ]]
  [[ "email@domain.com" =~ ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ ]]
  [[ "filename.txt" =~ \.txt$ ]]
  ```

- **Variable existence testing**: Check if variables are set or empty.
  - Test if variable is empty: `[[ ! $variable ]]`

  ```bash
  [[ ! $undefined_var ]]
  ```

## Double Parentheses Expressions `(( ))`

- **Arithmetic evaluation**: Use `(( ))` for mathematical calculations and numeric comparisons.
  - Evaluates arithmetic expressions using C-style syntax
  - Variables don't need `$` prefix inside double parentheses
  - Returns exit status 0 if result is non-zero, 1 if result is zero
  - Supports all standard arithmetic operators

  ```bash
  (( result = 10 + 5 ))
  (( count++ ))
  (( total += value ))
  ```

- **Arithmetic operators**: Mathematical operators available in `(( ))`.
  - `+` (addition): Add two numbers
  - `-` (subtraction): Subtract second number from first
  - `*` (multiplication): Multiply two numbers
  - `/` (division): Divide first number by second (integer division)
  - `%` (modulus): Remainder after division
  - `**` (exponentiation): Raise first number to power of second

  ```bash
  (( sum = a + b ))
  (( diff = x - y ))
  (( product = width * height ))
  (( remainder = num % 10 ))
  (( power = base ** exponent ))
  ```

- **Assignment operators**: Modify variables using arithmetic assignment operators.
  - `=` (assignment): Assign value to variable
  - `+=` (add and assign): Add value to variable
  - `-=` (subtract and assign): Subtract value from variable
  - `*=` (multiply and assign): Multiply variable by value
  - `/=` (divide and assign): Divide variable by value
  - `%=` (modulus and assign): Set variable to remainder

  ```bash
  (( counter = 0 ))
  (( counter += 5 ))
  (( total -= cost ))
  (( area *= 2 ))
  (( value /= 3 ))
  ```

- **Increment and decrement operators**: Modify variables by one.
  - `++variable` (pre-increment): Increment before use
  - `variable++` (post-increment): Increment after use
  - `--variable` (pre-decrement): Decrement before use
  - `variable--` (post-decrement): Decrement after use

  ```bash
  (( ++counter ))
  (( index++ ))
  (( --remaining ))
  (( attempts-- ))
  ```

- **Comparison operators**: Compare numbers using arithmetic comparison.
  - `==` (equal): Numbers are equal

  - `<` (less than): First number is less than second
  - `<=` (less than or equal): First number is less than or equal to second
  - `>` (greater than): First number is greater than second
  - `>=` (greater than or equal): First number is greater than or equal to second

  ```bash
  (( age >= 18 ))
  (( score < 100 ))
  (( count == 0 ))
  (( temperature > freezing ))
  ```

- **Logical operators**: Combine arithmetic conditions.
  - `&&` (and): Both conditions must be true
  - `||` (or): At least one condition must be true
  - `!` (not): Negates the condition

  ```bash
  (( age >= 18 && age <= 65 ))
  (( score >= 90 || extra_credit > 0 ))
  (( !(count == 0) ))
  ```

- **Bitwise operators**: Perform bit-level operations on integers.
  - `&` (bitwise AND): AND operation on each bit
  - `|` (bitwise OR): OR operation on each bit
  - `^` (bitwise XOR): XOR operation on each bit
  - `~` (bitwise NOT): Invert all bits
  - `<<` (left shift): Shift bits to the left
  - `>>` (right shift): Shift bits to the right

  ```bash
  (( result = a & b ))
  (( flags |= new_flag ))
  (( shifted = value << 2 ))
  ```

- **Conditional (ternary) operator**: Use `condition ? true_value : false_value` syntax.
  - Provides a concise way to assign values based on conditions
  - Similar to the ternary operator in C-style languages
  - Evaluates condition and returns one of two values

  ```bash
  (( result = (score >= 60) ? 1 : 0 ))
  (( max = (a > b) ? a : b ))
  (( sign = (num >= 0) ? 1 : -1 ))
  ```

- **Command substitution with arithmetic**: Use `$(( ))` to capture arithmetic results.
  - Returns the result of the arithmetic expression as a string
  - Can be used in assignments or command arguments
  - Useful for calculations that need to be used elsewhere

  ```bash
  result=$(( 10 + 5 ))
  echo "The answer is $(( a * b ))"
  array_index=$(( RANDOM % array_length ))
  ```

## Control Flow and Conditionals

- **Conditional statements**: Use `if` statements to execute code based on conditions.
  - Basic syntax: `if [[ CONDITION ]] then STATEMENTS fi`
  - Full syntax: `if [[ CONDITION ]] then STATEMENTS elif [[ CONDITION ]] then STATEMENTS else STATEMENTS fi`
  - Can use both `[[ ]]` and `(( ))` expressions for different types of conditions
  - **elif (else if)**: Optional, can be repeated multiple times to test additional conditions in sequence
  - **else**: Optional, executes when all previous conditions are false
  - Can mix double parentheses `(( ... ))` and double brackets `[[ ... ]]` in same conditional chain

  ```bash
  if (( NUMBER <= 15 ))
  then
      echo "B:$NUMBER"
  elif [[ $NUMBER -le 30 ]]
  then
      echo "I:$NUMBER"
  elif (( NUMBER < 46 ))
  then
      echo "N:$NUMBER"
  elif [[ $NUMBER -lt 61 ]]
  then
      echo "G:$NUMBER"
  else
      echo "O:$NUMBER"
  fi
  ```

## Command Execution and Process Control

- **Command separation**: Use semicolon (`;`) to run multiple commands on a single line.
  - Commands execute sequentially from left to right
  - Each command's exit status can be checked individually

  ```bash
  [[ 4 -ge 5 ]]; echo $?
  ls -l; echo "Done"
  ```

- **Exit status**: Every command has an exit status that indicates success or failure.
  - Access exit status of the last command with `$?`
  - Exit status `0` means success (true/no errors)
  - Any non-zero exit status means failure (false/errors occurred)
  - Common error codes: `127` (command not found), `1` (general error)

  ```bash
  echo $?
  [[ 4 -le 5 ]]; echo $?
  ls; echo $?
  bad_command; echo $?
  ```

- **Subshells and command substitution**: Different uses of parentheses for execution contexts.
  - Single parentheses `( ... )` create a subshell
  - `$( ... )` performs command substitution
  - Subshells run in separate environments and don't affect parent shell variables

  ```bash
  ( cd /tmp; echo "Current dir: $(pwd)" )
  current_date=$(date)
  file_count=$(ls | wc -l)
  echo "Today is $current_date"
  echo "Found $file_count files"
  ```

- **Sleep command**: Pause script execution for a specified number of seconds.
  - Useful for creating delays in scripts
  - Can be used with decimal values for subsecond delays

  ```bash
  sleep 3
  sleep 0.5
  sleep 1
  ```

## Loops

- **While loops**: Execute code repeatedly while a condition is true.
  - Syntax: `while [[ CONDITION ]] do STATEMENTS done`

  ```bash
  I=5
  while [[ $I -ge 0 ]]
  do
      echo $I
      (( I-- ))
      sleep 1
  done
  ```

- **Until loops**: Execute code repeatedly until a condition becomes true.
  - Syntax: `until [[ CONDITION ]] do STATEMENTS done`

  ```bash
  until [[ $QUESTION =~ \?$ ]]
  do
      echo "Please enter a question ending with ?"
      read QUESTION
  done
  until [[ $QUESTION =~ \?$ ]]
  do
      GET_FORTUNE again
  done
  ```

- **For loops**: Iterate through arrays or lists using `for` loops with `do` and `done` to define the loop's logical block.

  ```bash
  for server in "${servers[@]}"
  do
      echo "Processing $server"
  done
  for (( i = 1; i <= 5; i++ ))
  do
      echo "Number: $i"
  done
  for (( i = 5; i >= 1; i-- ))
  do
      echo "Countdown: $i"
  done
  for i in {1..5}
  do
      echo "Count: $i"
  done
  ```

## Arrays

- **Arrays**: Store multiple values in a single variable.
  - Create arrays with parentheses: `ARRAY=("value1" "value2" "value3")`
  - Access elements by index: `${ARRAY[0]}`, `${ARRAY[1]}`
  - Access all elements: `${ARRAY[@]}` or `${ARRAY[*]}`
  - Array indexing starts at 0

  ```bash
  RESPONSES=("Yes" "No" "Maybe" "Ask again later")
  echo ${RESPONSES[0]}
  echo ${RESPONSES[1]}
  echo ${RESPONSES[5]}
  echo ${RESPONSES[@]}
  echo ${RESPONSES[*]}
  ```

- **Array inspection with declare**: Use `declare -p` to view array details.
  - Shows the array type with `-a` flag
  - Displays all array elements and their structure

  ```bash
  ARR=("a" "b" "c")
  declare -p ARR # ARR=([0]="a" [1]="b" [2]="c")
  ```

- **Array expansion**: Use `"${array_name[@]}"` syntax to expand an array into individual elements.

```bash
for server in "${servers[@]}"
```

## Functions

- **Functions**: Create reusable blocks of code.
  - Define with `FUNCTION_NAME() { STATEMENTS }`
  - Call by using the function name
  - Can accept arguments accessible as `$1`, `$2`, etc.

  ```bash
  GET_FORTUNE() {
      echo "Ask a question:"
      read QUESTION
  }
  GET_FORTUNE
  ```

- **Function arguments**: Functions can accept arguments just like scripts.
  - Arguments are passed when calling the function
  - Access arguments inside function using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
  - Use conditional logic to handle different arguments

  ```bash
  GET_FORTUNE() {
      if [[ ! $1 ]]
      then
          echo "Ask a yes or no question:"
      else
          echo "Try again. Make sure it ends with a question mark:"
      fi
      read QUESTION
  }
  GET_FORTUNE
  GET_FORTUNE again
  ```

## Random Numbers and Mathematical Operations

- **Random numbers**: Generate random values using the `$RANDOM` variable.
  - `$RANDOM` generates numbers between 0 and 32767
  - Use modulus operator to limit range: `$RANDOM % 75`
  - Add 1 to avoid zero: `$(( RANDOM % 75 + 1 ))`
  - Must use `$(( ... ))` syntax for calculations with `$RANDOM`

  ```bash
  NUMBER=$(( RANDOM % 6 ))
  DICE=$(( RANDOM % 6 + 1 ))
  BINGO=$(( RANDOM % 75 + 1 ))
  echo $(( RANDOM % 10 ))
  ```

- **Random array access**: Use random numbers to access array elements randomly.
  - Generate random index within array bounds
  - Use random index to access array elements
  - Useful for random selections from predefined options

  ```bash
  RESPONSES=("Yes" "No" "Maybe" "Outlook good" "Don't count on it" "Ask again later")
  N=$(( RANDOM % 6 ))
  echo ${RESPONSES[$N]}
  ```

- **Modulus operator**: Use `%` to get the remainder of division operations.
  - Essential for limiting random number ranges
  - Works with `$RANDOM` to create bounded random values
  - `RANDOM % n` gives numbers from 0 to n-1

  ```bash
  echo $(( 15 % 4 ))
  echo $(( RANDOM % 100 ))
  echo $(( RANDOM % 10 + 1 ))
  ```

## Environment and System Information

- **Environment variables**: Predefined variables available in the shell environment.
  - `$RANDOM`: Generates random numbers between 0 and 32767
  - `$LANG`: System language setting
  - `$HOME`: User's home directory path
  - `$PATH`: Directories searched for executable commands
  - View all with `printenv` or `declare -p`

  ```bash
  echo $RANDOM
  echo $HOME
  echo $LANG
  printenv
  ```

- **Variable inspection**: Use `declare` to view and work with variables.
  - `declare -p`: Print all variables and their values
  - `declare -p VARIABLE`: Print specific variable details
  - Shows variable type (string, array, etc.) and attributes

  ```bash
  declare -p
  declare -p RANDOM
  declare -p MY_ARRAY
  ```

- **Command types**: Different categories of commands available in bash.
  - **Built-in commands**: Executed directly by the shell (e.g., `echo`, `read`, `if`)
  - **External commands**: Binary files in system directories (e.g., `ls`, `sleep`, `bash`)
  - **Shell keywords**: Language constructs (e.g., `then`, `do`, `done`)
  - Use `type <command>` to see what type a command is

  ```bash
  type echo
  type ls
  type if
  type ./script.sh
  ```

## File Creation and Management

- **File creation**: Use `touch` to create new empty files.
  - Creates a new file if it doesn't exist
  - Updates the timestamp if the file already exists
  - Commonly used to create script files before editing

  ```bash
  touch script.sh
  touch bingo.sh
  touch filename.txt
  ```

## Creating and Running Bash Scripts

- **Script execution methods**: Multiple ways to run bash scripts:
  - **`sh scriptname.sh`**: Run with the sh shell interpreter.
  - **`bash scriptname.sh`**: Run with the bash shell interpreter.
  - **`./scriptname.sh`**: Execute directly (requires executable permissions).

```bash
sh questionnaire.sh
bash questionnaire.sh
./questionnaire.sh
```

## File Permissions and Script Execution

- **Permission denied error**: When using `./scriptname.sh`, you may get "permission denied" if the file lacks executable permissions.
- **Checking permissions**: Use `ls -l` to view file permissions.

  ```bash
  ls -l questionnaire.sh
  ```

- **Permission format**: The output shows permissions as `-rw-r--r--` where:
  - First character (`-`): File type (- for regular file, d for directory)
  - Next 9 characters: Permissions for owner, group, and others
  - `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute
  
- **Adding executable permissions**: Use `chmod +x` to give executable permissions to everyone.

  ```bash
  chmod +x questionnaire.sh
  ```

- **Script organization**: Best practices for structuring bash scripts.
  - Start with shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)
  - Add descriptive comments about script purpose
  - Define variables at the top
  - Group related functions together
  - Main script logic at the bottom

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  NAME="value"
  ARRAY=("item1" "item2")
  my_function() {
      echo "Function code here"
  }
  my_function
  echo "Script complete"
  ```

- **Sequential script execution**: Create master scripts that run multiple programs in sequence.
  - Useful for automating workflows that involve multiple scripts
  - Each script runs to completion before the next one starts
  - Can combine different programs into a single execution flow
  - Arguments can be passed to individual scripts as needed
  - Can include different types of programs (interactive, automated, etc.)

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  ./setup.sh
  ./interactive.sh
  ./processing.sh
  ./cleanup.sh
  ```

## Database Normalization

This is the process of organizing a relational database to reduce data redundancy and improve integrity.

Its benefits include:

- Minimizing duplicated data, which saves storage and reduces inconsistencies.
- Enforcing data integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys.
- Making databases easier to maintain and understand.

### Normal Forms

- **1NF (First Normal Form)**
  - Each cell contains a single (atomic) value.
  - Each record is unique (enforced by a primary key).
  - Order of rows/columns is irrelevant.
  - Example: Move multiple phone numbers from a `students` table into a separate `student_phones` table.

- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**
  - Meets 1NF requirements.
  - No **partial dependencies**: every non-key attribute must depend on the entire composite primary key.
  - Example: Split `orders` table into `order_header` and `order_items` to avoid attributes depending on only part of the key.

- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**
  - Meets 2NF requirements.
  - No **transitive dependencies**: non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes.
  - Example: Move `city_postal_code` to a `cities` table instead of storing it with every order.

- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**
  - Meets 3NF requirements.
  - Every determinant (left-hand side of a functional dependency) must be a superkey.

**Tip**: Aim for 3NF in most designs for a good balance of integrity and performance.

## Key SQL Concepts

- SQL is a Structured Query Language for communicating with relational databases.
- **Basic commands** â†’ `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, etc.
- `Joins` â†’ Combines data from multiple tables (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, `FULL JOIN`).

## Running SQL Commands in Bash

You can run SQL commands directly from the command line using the `psql` command-line client for PostgreSQL or similar tools for other databases.

For example, to run a SQL file in PostgreSQL:

```bash
psql -U username -d database_name -c "SELECT * FROM students;"
```

You can also execute MySQL commands directly:

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name -e "SELECT * FROM students;"
```

### Run SQL from a File

```bash
# PostgreSQL
psql -U username -d database_name -f script.sql

# MySQL
mysql -u username -p database_name < script.sql
```

### Embed SQL in a Bash Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DB_USER="school_admin"
DB_NAME="school"

# Insert student data
psql -U "$DB_USER" -d "$DB_NAME" -c \
"INSERT INTO students (name, age, major) VALUES ('Alice', 20, 'CS');"
```

### Use of Variables in SQL

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DB_USER="school_admin"
DB_NAME="school"
STUDENT_NAME="Bob"
AGE=21

psql -U "$DB_USER" -d "$DB_NAME" -c \
"INSERT INTO students (name, age) VALUES ('$STUDENT_NAME', $AGE);"
```

**Tip**: Sanitize variables to avoid SQL injection.

## Retrieving and Using SQL Query Results in Bash

When you run SQL queries via `psql`, you can **capture** and **process** the returned values in your Bash scripts.

### Capturing a Single Value

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DB_USER="school_admin"
DB_NAME="school"

# Get total student count
STUDENT_COUNT=$(psql -U "$DB_USER" -d "$DB_NAME" -t -A -c \
"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students;")

echo "Total students: $STUDENT_COUNT"
```

Output â†’ 42

### Retrieving Multiple Columns

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DB_USER="school_admin"
DB_NAME="school"

# Get top 3 students' names and ages
RESULTS=$(psql -U "$DB_USER" -d "$DB_NAME" -t -A -F"," -c \
"SELECT name, age FROM students LIMIT 3;")

echo "Top 3 students:"
echo "$RESULTS"
```

Output

```bash
Alice,20
Bob,21
Charlie,22
```

### Looping Through Query Results

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DB_USER="school_admin"
DB_NAME="school"

# Get student names and majors
psql -U "$DB_USER" -d "$DB_NAME" -t -A -F"," -c \
"SELECT name, major FROM students;" | while IFS="," read -r name major
do
    echo "Student: $name | Major: $major"
done
```

Shape of Output

```bash
Student: Alice | Major: CS
Student: Bob   | Major: Math
Student: Carol | Major: Physics
```

## SQL Injection

It is a web security vulnerability where attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate the database.

This can lead to risky actions like:

- Bypassing authentication.
- Stealing sensitive data.
- Modifying or deleting records.

An example of an SQL injection attack:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ' " " OR "1"="1" -- ' AND password = 'anything';
```

This query would return all users because the condition `OR "1"="1"` is always true, allowing attackers to bypass login checks.

### Preventing SQL Injection

1. **Use Prepared Statements**: These separate SQL code from data, preventing injection. Here's an example (Node.js with pg):

    ```sql
    client.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1 AND password = $2', [username, password]);
    ```

2. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.

3. **Least Privilege**: Use database accounts with the minimum permissions necessary for the application.

**Note**: Never grant admin rights to application accounts.

## N+1 Problem

The N+1 problem occurs when an application makes one query to retrieve a list of items (N) and then makes an additional query for each item to retrieve related data, resulting in N+1 queries.

**Why Itâ€™s Bad**

- Each query adds network and processing overhead.
- Multiple small queries are slower than one optimized query.

### Example of N+1 Pattern

```sql
-- 1: Get list of orders
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 50;

-- N: For each order, get customer
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE customer_id = ...;
```

**Solution**: Use `JOINs` or other set-based operations.

```sql
SELECT 
  orders.order_id,
  orders.product,
  orders.quantity,
  customers.customer_id,
  customers.name,
  customers.email,
  customers.address
FROM orders
JOIN customers 
  ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id
WHERE orders.order_id IN (SELECT order_id FROM orders LIMIT 50);
```

Always look for opportunities to combine related data into a single query.
