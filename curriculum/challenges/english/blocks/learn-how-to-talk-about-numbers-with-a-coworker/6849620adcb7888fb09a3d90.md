<!-- (audio) Sophie: I'm interested in the average usage over the past month. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What time period is Sophie asking about?

## --answers--

Next month's planned usage.

### --feedback--

She says `over the past month`, which means she's looking back, not forward.

---

The last four weeks leading up to now.

---

This week only.

### --feedback--

She's asking about a full month, not just one week.

---

Just last year's data.

### --feedback--

`Past month` refers to the most recent month, not the previous year.

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`Over the past month` means from now going back 30 days (or four weeks).

Sophie wants to see how the platform was used during that recent time frame.
