# --explanation--

An **ordinal number** shows the order or position of something in a list or sequence (e.g. `first`, `second`, `third`).

In this case, `The third meeting` shows the position of this meeting in a series of meetings. The other sentences either use cardinal numbers or apply ordinals in wrong contexts.
