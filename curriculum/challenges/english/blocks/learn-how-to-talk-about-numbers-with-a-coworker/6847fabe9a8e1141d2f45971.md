# --explanation--

`Eighty-three percent` is the correct way to read 83%.

You always use `percent` (not `percentages`) after an exact number. What's the difference?

Use `percent` after a number:

- 83% is `eighty-three percent`.

- 20% is `twenty percent`.

Use `percentage` or `percentages` in general, not after a number:

- `Eighty-three percentages` is incorrect.

- `We saw an increase in percentages across departments.` is correct (used without a specific number).

This is important for giving clear updates, especially when discussing statistics or reports.
