`ten tasks`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase includes a cardinal number. It tells you how many pieces of work are planned.

# --explanation--

To `outline` something means to list or describe its main parts, usually in a clear and organized way. For example:
 
`They outlined the project steps in a document.` â€” They listed the steps clearly.

`Ten tasks` uses the cardinal number `ten` to show how many jobs or actions are planned.

So, James is saying they have created a clear plan with ten different tasks for development.
