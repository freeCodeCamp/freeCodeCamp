# --explanation--

`Reassuring` means something makes you feel better or more confident, especially when you're unsure. For example:

`The team leader gave a reassuring update about the project.` — The update helped the team feel confident that things were okay.

David is happy that 15% of the budget is saved in case of emergency — it gives him peace of mind.
