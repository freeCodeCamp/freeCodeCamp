`Can you tell me how much we've spent BLANK?`

`to date`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means "up until now" — from the beginning of the project until the present moment.

# --explanation--

`To date` is commonly used in project and business reports to mean "so far" or "until now". For example:
 
`To date, we've completed 80% of the project.` — So far, they have finished most of the work.

In David's question, he's asking how much of the budget has been spent from the start of the project up to now.
