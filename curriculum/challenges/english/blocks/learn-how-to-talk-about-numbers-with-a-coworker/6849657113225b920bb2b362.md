<!-- (audio) Tom: The platform was used on average about sixty hours per week by the team. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`The platform was used on average about BLANK by the team.`

## --blanks--

`sixty hours per week`

### --feedback--

These four words show how much time something is used, following the structure: number + unit + `per` + time period.

# --explanation--

The structure "number + unit + `per` + time period" is commonly used to express time spent on an activity. For example:

- `The backup runs 30 minutes per day.` - The backup process takes 30 minutes daily.

- `The system runs for 20 hours per week.` - The system works 20 hours every week.

Tom says the platform is used about `60 hours per week`, meaning the team spends that amount of time using it each week.
