# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Specifically, one-fourth of this portion is directed towards BLANK development, which is crucial given our BLANK goals.`

## --blanks--

`back-end`

### --feedback--

This refers to the part of the system that handles data, servers, and logic. This is a compound word, remember to use `-`.

---

`scalability`

### --feedback--

This word describes how easily a system can grow or handle more work as demand increases.

# --explanation--

`Back end` refers to the server-side part of software — the part that manages data, logic, and processes behind the scenes. In the dialogue, it acts as a compound adjective and uses `-`. Another example:

`She's working on the back-end code today.` — She is writing or fixing the part of the code that runs behind the scenes.

`Scalability` means how well a system can handle growth, such as more users or larger amounts of data. For example:

`They tested the system's scalability under high traffic.` — They checked if the system works well when many people use it.

In the sentence, Alice is explaining that back end is essential to support growth, which is why it's a key budget area.
