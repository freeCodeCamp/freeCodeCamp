# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`The BLANK was around eighty hours two weeks ago.`

## --blanks--

`peak usage`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means the highest amount of time or activity recorded in a given period.

# --explanation--

`Peak usage` means the time when something is used the most. For example:

`The server slows down during peak usage.` — The server works slower when many users use it at the same time.

In Tom's sentence, the team used the design platform more than usual two weeks ago — hitting a high point of 80 hours.
