`Intuitive` means something is easy to figure out naturally, even for first-time users. For example:

`The app's intuitive layout made it easy to find everything.` — The app was designed in a simple, clear way, so users could quickly find what they needed.

`User-friendly` means the design is easy, pleasant, and efficient for the person using it. For example:

`User-friendly tools reduce the need for training.` — Easy-to-use features mean users don't need much help or instruction to start using them.

Alice is saying the interface is designed so well that users can understand it quickly and enjoy using it.
