## --sentence--

`For the initial phase, BLANK is to finalize the software requirements by next Friday.`

## --blanks--

`the first task`

### --feedback--

These three words show that this is the number one thing to do.

# --explanation--

**Ordinal numbers** tell the position of something in a sequence, such as steps, tasks, or stages. Examples include: `first`, `second`, `third`, `fourth`, and so on.

To form most ordinal numbers, you take the **cardinal number** (1, 2, 3, 4...) and add the correct ending. Most ordinal numbers follow the pattern of adding `-th`, like 4 becomes `fourth`, and 6 becomes `sixth`. But 1, 2, and 3 are irregular: 1 becomes `first`, 2 becomes `second`, and 3 becomes `third`.

In the dialogue, `the first task` means it is the first action that needs to be completed in the initial phase.
