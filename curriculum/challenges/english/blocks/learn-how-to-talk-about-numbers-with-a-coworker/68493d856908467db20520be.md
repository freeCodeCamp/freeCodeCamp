<!-- (audio) Tom: They're mainly on the central server under the Licensed Software folder. A few are also in the cloud storage, specifically in the Backup Licenses section. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which location contains most licenses?

## --answers--

The central server

---

The cloud storage

### --feedback--

Tom says a few are in the cloud, and most are on the central server.

---

The design team's shared folder

### --feedback--

That location isn't mentioned in this statement.

---

It's not possible to tell from the conversation.

### --feedback--

Tom clearly says `They're mainly on the central server`, so we do know.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Tom uses `mainly` for the central server and `a few` for cloud storage.

This shows that most licenses are on the server, and only a small number are stored online as backups.
