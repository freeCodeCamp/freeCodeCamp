# --explanation--

`By when...` is commonly used to ask when something will be finished. This is a polite way to ask for a time estimate or deadline. For example:

`By when do you need the report?` â€” What is the latest time you want the report?

`Third` is an ordinal number, which shows the position in a sequence. `Phase` means a stage of a project, so `third phase` refers to the third big part of their project plan.
