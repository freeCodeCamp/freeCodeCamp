# --instructions--

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`And what about the BLANK and BLANK aspects?`

## --blanks--

`front-end`

### --feedback--

This refers to the part of a website or app that users interact with. Remember to use `-`.

---

`design`

### --feedback--

This word refers to the visual style and user experience of a product or screen.

# --explanation--

The `front end` is the user-facing part of software — everything the user sees and interacts with (like buttons, menus, layout). In the dialogue, it acts as a compound adjective and uses `-`. Another example:

`The front-end team built the new homepage interface.` — The team that works on what users see made the new design for the main page.

`Design` refers to how the software looks and feels — color, layout, icons, typography, and usability. For example:

`Good design improves how users experience the app.` — If the app looks nice and is easy to use, people enjoy using it more.

David is asking how much attention or budget is given to both the visual and interactive parts of the project.
