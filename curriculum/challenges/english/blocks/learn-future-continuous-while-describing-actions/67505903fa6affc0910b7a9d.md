`DoS attacks`

### --feedback--

This phrase of two words means a system or network gets overloaded with too much traffic, making it unable to work properly or respond to real users. The first word is an acronym for `Denial of Service`.

# --explanation--

`Prevent` means to stop something from happening or to make sure it does not occur. For example:  

`The new software update will prevent unauthorized access to the system.` - This means that the update will stop unauthorized people from gaining access to the system.

`DoS attacks` refer to Denial of Service attacks, which are attempts to make a computer or network service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic. For example:  

`The website was temporarily offline due to a large-scale DoS attack.` - This means the website was made unavailable because it was overloaded with harmful traffic.
