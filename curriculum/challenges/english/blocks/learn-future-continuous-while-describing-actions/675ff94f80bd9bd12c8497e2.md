### --feedback--

This phrase of two words refers to work-related emails that often contain private or sensitive information. The second word is in the plural form.

# --explanation--

`Avoid` means to stay away from something or not do it because it can cause problems. For example:

`Employees should avoid clicking on links from unknown senders in emails.` - It means that employees should not click on links they don't trust because these links might lead to scams or security risks.

`Corporate emails` are work-related emails that often have private or sensitive information about the company. For example:

`Using a secure connection is important when checking corporate emails outside the office.` - It highlights that work emails often contain important information, so using a secure internet connection is necessary to keep them private and safe from hackers.
