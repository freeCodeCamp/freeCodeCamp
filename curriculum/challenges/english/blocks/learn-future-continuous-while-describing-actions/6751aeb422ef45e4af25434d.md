`Stress tests` are evaluations designed to see how a system performs under high pressure or extreme conditions. For example:  

`The developers ran stress tests on the website to check its performance during peak traffic.` - This means the developers tested the website to ensure it could handle a large number of visitors at the same time.

`Unexpected` means something unplanned or surprising. For example:  

`The system crashed due to unexpected behavior during the update.` - This means the system failed because of issues that were not anticipated during the update.
