This phrase of three words means two or a small number, typically more than one but not many.

# --explanation--

`Around` means approximately or near a certain time, place, or amount. For example:  

`The meeting will start around 10 AM.` - This means the meeting is expected to start at approximately 10 AM, but not exactly at that time.

`A couple of` means two or a small number. For example:  

`We need a couple of days to finish the project.` - This means that the project will take about two days, but it could be slightly more in some contexts.
