# --explanation--

`Resolve` means to solve or fix a problem or situation. It implies taking action to address and settle an issue. For example:

`The team worked hard to resolve the customer complaints.` - It indicates that the team took steps to solve the issues raised by customers.

`Don't` in tag questions is used after a positive main sentence to seek agreement or confirmation in a polite or conversational way. For example:

`We need to leave now, don't we?` - The main sentence is positive, and the tag question (`don't we?`) is used to confirm or check agreement about the urgency to leave.
