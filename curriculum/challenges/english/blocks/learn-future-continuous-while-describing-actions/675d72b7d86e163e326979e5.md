## --blanks--

`staging server`

### --feedback--

This phrase of two words means a separate environment used for testing changes before they go live. It mirrors the production server to ensure updates work as expected.

---

`can't`

### --feedback--

It is part of a tag question, used here to confirm or check agreement after a positive main statement using `can`.

# --explanation--

`Staging server` refers to a testing environment where changes to a system or application are tested before being implemented on the live, production server. For example:

`We uploaded the new website features to the staging server for testing.` - In this sentence, `staging server` is the testing space used to ensure that the new website features function correctly before they go live.

`Can't` in this context is part of a tag question. It follows a positive statement to confirm or check agreement in a polite or conversational way. For example:

`We can finish the task today, can't we?` - In this sentence, the positive statement (`We can finish the task today`) is followed by the negative tag question (`can't we?`) to check for agreement or confirmation.
