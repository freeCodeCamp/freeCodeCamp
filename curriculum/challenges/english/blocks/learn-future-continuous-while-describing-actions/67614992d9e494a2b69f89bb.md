`Dear Team,`

After discussing the risks with Brian, Anna decided to inform the team about preventing MitM attacks, especially during work-related travel:

`As the summit is near and many of you will be traveling for work, it's important to stay safe online. Man-in-the-Middle attacks (MitM) often happen on public Wi-Fi or unsecured networks, especially during peak travel times. These attacks can steal your data, including corporate emails and sensitive information.`

`To stay protected, always use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when accessing sensitive information or company systems. Avoid using public Wi-Fi for important tasks. Check the updated security tips and job aids we've shared. They include simple steps to keep your data safe while traveling.`

`We've scheduled a security review meeting to share more advice and discuss security protocols. If you have any questions or need help setting up your VPN, contact the security team before your trip.`

`Stay safe,`
`Your Security Team`
