# --instructions--

This task doesn't have audio. Read the question below and select the correct answer.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which of the following sentences uses a tag question correctly?

## --answers--

`The tokens are updated, are they?`

### --feedback--

Since the main sentence is positive, the tag question should be negative: `aren't they?`.

---

`The tokens are updated, aren't they?`

---

`The tokens are updated, are them?`

### --feedback--

The tag question must use the subject `they` instead of the object `them`. The correct form is `are they?`.

---

`The tokens are updated, do they?`

### --feedback--

`Do they?` is used for the verb `do`, not `are`. For a sentence with `are`, the correct tag question is `aren't they?`.

# --explanation--

In tag questions, when the main sentence is positive and the subject is plural (like `tokens`), you use a negative tag question, `aren't they?`. This confirms or checks the information. The other options do not follow the correct tag question structure.
