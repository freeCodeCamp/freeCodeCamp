# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I see. How often should we remind employees to use BLANK BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`secure`

### --feedback--

This word means protected or safe from threats, like hacking or unauthorized access.

---

`connections`

### --feedback--

This word in the plural form refers to links or pathways that allow devices to communicate with each other or access the internet.

# --explanation--

`Secure` means something that is safe and protected from risks, like hacking, stealing data, or someone getting access without permission. For example:

`All employees should use secure passwords to protect their accounts.` - This sentence shows how using strong and safe passwords helps keep accounts private and stops others from breaking into them.

`Connections` are the links that let devices talk to each other or use the internet. For example:

`Using encrypted connections helps protect sensitive information during online meetings.` - This sentence shows that using safe and protected links keeps shared information private during online meetings, so no one can see or steal it without permission.
