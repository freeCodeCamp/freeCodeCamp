`Solution` means an answer or way to fix a problem. For example:

`The engineers worked hard to find a solution to the network issue.` - It means the engineers worked hard to resolve the network problem.

`Frustrated` describes a feeling of being upset or annoyed when something doesn't work or takes too long. For example:

`The customers were frustrated by the long wait times.` - It describes the annoyance and dissatisfaction customers felt because of delays.

`Do` in tag questions is used after a negative main sentence to confirm or check agreement. For example:

`We don't need to leave now, do we?` - The main sentence is negative, and the tag (`do we?`) is positive, asking for confirmation in a conversational way.
