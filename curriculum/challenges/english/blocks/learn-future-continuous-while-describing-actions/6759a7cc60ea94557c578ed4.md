# --explanation--

The word `tokens` refers to pieces of information, often in digital form, that are used in authentication systems to verify or identify a user. For example:

`The system uses tokens to verify each user's session.` - This means the system relies on pieces of information as a secure way to confirm that a user is authorized to access specific resources or continue a session.

The word `refreshed` means updated or renewed to ensure continued validity or functionality. For example:

`The page was refreshed to display the latest updates.` - In this case, `refreshed` means the page was reloaded to show new or updated information, ensuring that the user sees the most current version of the content.
