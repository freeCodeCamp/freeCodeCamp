`monitoring`

### --feedback--

This word means observing or keeping track of something, especially to ensure it is functioning correctly. It ends in `-ing`.

# --explanation--

`Monitoring` refers to observing or tracking the performance or status of something, usually to ensure it operates smoothly or to identify issues. For example:  

`The team is monitoring the servers to prevent downtime.` - This means the team is actively watching the servers to ensure they work without interruptions. 

The `Future Continuous` tense describes actions that will be ongoing at a specific point in the future. It is formed using `will be` + verb ending in `-ing`. For example:

`The IT team will be troubleshooting the network issues tomorrow afternoon.` - This indicates that the IT team will actively work on fixing network problems during a particular time in the future.  

Brian uses the `Future Continuous` tense to show that he will be actively tracking the system's performance to ensure everything runs smoothly.
