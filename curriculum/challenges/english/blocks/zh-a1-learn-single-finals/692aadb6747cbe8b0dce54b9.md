<!-- (Audio) speaker: ā -->

# --description--

For single finals like `a`, the tone mark goes directly on the vowel. For example, `ā` (first tone).

As a reminder, in this curriculum, to input Pinyin with tone marks, you just type the tone number (1-5) after the Pinyin, and the tone mark will be added automatically.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the final with the correct tone mark.
