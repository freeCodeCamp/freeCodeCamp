## What Is Pinyin?

Pinyin, literally meaning "spelled sounds", is a romanization system for Chinese. It uses the Latin alphabet to show how to pronounce Chinese characters.

Pinyin shows how a character sounds. It does not show what the character means.

In this curriculum, you'll learn Pinyin for the standard spoken Chinese, Mandarin. Other varieties of Chinese use different systems.

## Why Learn Pinyin First

Learning Pinyin first makes Chinese much easier because:

- You can read and type Chinese, even without knowing characters.
- You can pronounce words correctly from the beginning.
- You can look up words in dictionaries just by their sound.

## Pinyin Syllable Structure

A syllable is a single unit of pronunciation. In Pinyin, each syllable represents a character and has three parts:

**Initial**

This is the consonant sound at the beginning of the syllable. For example, in `ma`, the initial is `m`.

There are 21 initials in Pinyin.

**Final**

This is the part that comes after the initial. It can be a single vowel, like `a` in `ma`; a combination of vowels, for example, `ou` in `mou`; or vowels followed by `n` or `ng`, such as `an` in `shan`, and `ang` in `mang`.

A syllable might not have an initial, but it always has a final, like `ai`.

There are 36 finals in Pinyin.

**Tone**

This is the pitch pattern or variation of pitch of a syllable. There are four main tones, represented by symbols `ˉ`, `ˊ`, `ˇ`, `ˋ`, as well as the neutral tone, which has no symbol.

| Tone   | Pitch Pattern     | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| first tone   | high, level       | mā|
| second tone  | high, rising      | má|
| third tone   | falling and rising| mǎ|
| fourth tone  | falling           | mà|
| neutral tone | short and soft    | ma|

Tones change the meaning of a character, even if the initial and final stay the same. For example: `mā` with the first tone means "mother", while `mǎ` with the third tone means "horse".

In this chapter, you will learn finals, initials, tones, and syllables.

As you learn Chinese characters in later chapters, you will learn more Pinyin knowledge like tone sandhi. And you'll keep reviewing and practicing what you've learned here. If you find it challenging, that's completely normal. As you learn characters, words, and sentences, your familiarity with Pinyin will grow, and your pronunciation will become more natural.
