## What Is Pinyin?

Pinyin, literally meaning "spelled sounds", is a romanization system for Chinese. It uses the Latin alphabet to show how to pronounce Chinese characters.

Pinyin shows how a character sounds. It does not show what the character means.

In this curriculum, you'll learn the Pinyin for the standard spoken language called Mandarin. Other varieties of Chinese use different systems.

## Why Learn Pinyin First

Learning Pinyin first makes Chinese much easier because:

- You can read and type Chinese, even without knowing characters.
- You can pronounce words correctly from the beginning.
- You can look up words in dictionaries just by their sound.

## Pinyin Syllable Structure

A syllable is a single unit of pronunciation. In Pinyin, each syllable represents a character and has three parts:

**Initial**

This is the consonant sound at the beginning of the syllable. For example, in `ma`, the initial is `m`. Some syllables do not have an initial, like `ai`.

There are 21 initials in Pinyin.

**Final**

This is the part that comes after the initial. It can be a single vowel, as in `a` from `ma`; a combination of vowels, as `ou` in `mou`; or vowels followed by `n` or `ng`, as in `an` and `mang`.

There are 36 finals in Pinyin.

**Tone**

This is the pitch pattern of the syllable. There are four main tones with different pitch patterns, plus a neutral tone that is short and soft.

| Tone   | Pitch Pattern     | Example |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 1st    | High, level       | mā (audio) |
| 2nd    | High, rising      | má (audio) |
| 3rd    | Falling and rising| mǎ (audio) |
| 4th    | Falling           | mà (audio) |
| Neutral| Short and soft    | ma (audio) |

Tones change the meaning of a character, even if the initial and final stay the same. For example: `mā` with the first tone means mother, while `mǎ` with the third tone means horse.

In this first block, you will learn finals, tones, syllable structure, and the basic tone mark rules.

In later blocks, as you learn Chinese characters, you will learn more advanced Pinyin knowledge like tone sandhi. And you'll keep reviewing and practicing what you've learned here. If you find it challenging now, that's completely normal. As you learn characters, words, and sentences, your familiarity with Pinyin will grow, and your pronunciation will become more natural.
