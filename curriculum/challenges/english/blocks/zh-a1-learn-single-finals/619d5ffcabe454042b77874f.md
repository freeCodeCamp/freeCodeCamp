<!-- (Audio) A: e -->

# --description--

To pronounce `e`, open your mouth slightly and keep the lips relaxed without rounding. The tongue is positioned in the middle of the mouth, neither high nor low. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
