<!-- (Audio) speaker: a o e i u ü -->

# --description--

There are six single finals in Pinyin: `a`, `o`, `e`, `i`, `u`, and `ü`. Each is a pure vowel sound pronounced with a steady mouth shape.

This audio has the sounds of single finals. Try to pronounce them. You will learn them in more details soon.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing each single final.
