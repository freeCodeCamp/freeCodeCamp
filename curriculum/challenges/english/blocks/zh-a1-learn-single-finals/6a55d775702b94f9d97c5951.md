<!-- (Audio) A: ā -->

# --description--

For single finals like `a`, the tone mark goes directly on the vowel. For example, `ā` (first tone).

As a reminder, in this curriculum, you can type the tone number after the Pinyin, and the tone mark will be added automatically.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the final with the correct tone mark.

# --fillInTheBlank--

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`ā`

### --feedback--

This is the simple final `a` with the first tone, which is high and flat.
