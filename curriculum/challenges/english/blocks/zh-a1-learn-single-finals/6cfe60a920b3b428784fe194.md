# --description--

The first single final you'll learn is `a`.

To pronounce `a`, open your mouth wide naturally, keep your jaw relaxed, and the tongue lies flat and low in the mouth. Make sure the sound is steady and clear. Do not round your lips or spread them too much.

Each Pinyin syllable is spoken with a specific tone, and these tones are just as important as the initials and finals in determining its pronunciation.

A change in tone can completely alter the meaning of a syllable, even when the initials and finals remain exactly the same.

There are four main tones:

- First tone (`ˉ`): A high, level pitch maintained consistently throughout the syllable.

- Second tone (`ˊ`): A rising pitch that starts in the mid-range and moves upward to a high ending point.

- Third tone (`ˇ`): A dipping tone that begins in the mid-range, descends to a low point, then rises back up.

- Fourth tone (`ˋ`): A sharp falling pitch that starts high and drops quickly to the bottom of the vocal range.

There is also a neutral tone, which is short and soft. It is not marked with any tone mark.

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
