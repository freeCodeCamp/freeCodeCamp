<!-- (Audio) speaker: u -->

# --description--

To pronounce `u`, round your lips and push them slightly forward, but do not make them too tight. The tongue is raised high at the back of the mouth while the jaw stays relaxed. The sound should be short and focused, not overly long.

Practice pronouncing `u` with different tones.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
