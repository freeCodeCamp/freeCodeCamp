<!-- (Audio) A: o -->

# --description--

To pronounce `o`, round your lips gently, keeping them relaxed and not pushed forward. The back of your tongue should be slightly raised, while your jaw remains loose. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
