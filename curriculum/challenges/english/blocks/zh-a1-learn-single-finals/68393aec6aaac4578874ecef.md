<!-- (Audio) speaker: ü -->

# --description--

`ü` is the last single final.

To pronounce it, round your lips tightly, as if you're about to whistle. The tongue is positioned high in the front of the mouth, similar to `i`, but with rounded lips. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.

Practice pronouncing `ü` with different tones.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
