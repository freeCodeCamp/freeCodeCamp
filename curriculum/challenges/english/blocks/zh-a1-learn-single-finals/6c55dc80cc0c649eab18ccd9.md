<!-- (Audio) A: i -->

# --description--

To pronounce `i`, spread your lips into a smile, keeping them relaxed. The tongue is positioned high in the front of the mouth, close to the roof. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
