# --description--

In this workshop, you will practice using `for...of` loops by building a function that counts the occurrences of a string in an array of strings.

But before you start working on that function, you will create a simpler function that logs each character of string to the console.

Start by defining an empty function called `printCharacters` with the parameter `str`.
