# --description--

In this workshop, you will practice using `for...of` loops by building a function that counts how often a string appears in an array of strings.

Before you write that function, you will create a simpler one that logs each character of a string to the console.

Start by defining an empty function called `printCharacters` with the parameter `str`.
