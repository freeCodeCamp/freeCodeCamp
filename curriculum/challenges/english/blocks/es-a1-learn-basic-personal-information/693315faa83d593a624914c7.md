# --explanation--

Ángela says `¿Y Huamán? ¿Cómo se escribe?`

`Y` means connects this question to the previous one.

`Cómo` is used to ask about the way something is done.

`Se escribe` means it is written.

The verb `escribe` comes from `escribir`, which means to write.

Ángela already knows the last name. Now she asks how to write or spell it correctly.
