# --explanation--

Ángela says `¿Y tu profesión?`, a short follow-up question. `Y` connects this question to the previous topic.

Even though she does not say `¿Cuál es...?`, the full question is understood from context:

`¿Cuál es tu profesión?`

In conversation, Spanish often omits repeated words when the meaning is clear.
