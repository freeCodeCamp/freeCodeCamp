<!-- (Audio) Mateo: ¿Quieres que te lo deletree? -->

# --description--

In this task, you will hear Mateo ask a question using the **informal `tú` form**. He uses `¿Quieres...?` and `te`, both of which are signals that he's speaking to someone he knows well or is on casual terms with.  

In Spanish, when speaking **formally** or to show **respect**, the structure would change. For example:

`¿Quiere que se lo deletree?` — using the **"usted"** form with `quiere` and `se`.  

Understanding these differences is important for navigating both casual and formal conversations.
