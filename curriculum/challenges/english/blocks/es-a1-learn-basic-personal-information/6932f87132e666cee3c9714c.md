<!-- (Audio) Ángela: ¿Cuál es tu nombre y apellido? -->

# --description--

Ángela asks a question using the structure `¿Cuál es tu` + noun.

She could stop there. Instead, she adds another piece of information using the connector `y` and a second noun.

`y` is a conjunction used to connect two nouns. Here's the structure she uses:

`¿Cuál es tu` + noun + `y` + noun`?`

This allows the speaker to request more than one detail in the same question.

# --explanation--

In the sentence `¿Cuál es tu nombre y apellido?`, two nouns are connected with `y`:

- `nombre`

- `apellido`

The word `y` connects two pieces of information.

Ángela first asks for the person's `nombre` and then adds `apellido`. 

This structure allows the speaker to request multiple details in one question:

`¿Cuál es tu correo y número?`

Here, the second piece of information Ángela asks for is `apellido`.
