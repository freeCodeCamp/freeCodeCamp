# --explanation--

When someone suggests an idea and follows it with `Would that help?`, `that` refers back to the idea they just shared. It's a polite and supportive way to check if the suggestion would be useful for the other person. For example:

`I can send over a summary of the meeting. Would that help?` â€“ Here, `that` refers to sending the summary, and the speaker is checking if it would be useful.
