# --explanation--

`I understand` can be used to show that you recognize and accept what someone else is saying. It can express both emotional support and agreement with another person's point of view. It is often used to show empathy or agreement without needing to say much more. For example:

`I understand why you're upset.` â€“ This shows you recognize the other person's feelings and point of view.
