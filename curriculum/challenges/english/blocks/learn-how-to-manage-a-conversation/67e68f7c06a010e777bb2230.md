# --explanation--

`It seems to be` + verb in the `-ing` form is used to describe something that is apparently happening, though it may not be confirmed. For example:

`The app seems to be running slower today.` – This means it appears that the app is slower than usual.

`To cause something to` + verb means to make something happen or trigger an action. For example:

`Low memory can cause the program to crash.` – This means low memory is the reason the program stops working.
