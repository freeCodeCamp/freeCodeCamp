# --explanation--

`It's been a while since...` is normally used when a significant amount of time has passed since something happened. It's often used to refer to the last time something occurred, but with a focus on how much time has passed. For example:

`It's been a while since we last met.` â€“ This sentence means that the speaker and the other person haven't met for some time.
