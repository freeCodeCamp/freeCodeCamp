`I hope you're doing well.`

`I wanted to reach out to confirm the new project requirements following our recent discussions. We've made some adjustments to the timeline due to recent changes and need to ensure we're aligned on the updated requirements before proceeding.`

`We're proposing a new deadline for the first phase of the project at the end of next month. Please let us know if this works for you or if there are any additional adjustments we should consider.`

`Additionally, James has sent me the updated project plan, which I've attached to this email for your review. Please take a look and let us know if everything looks good on your end.`

`Looking forward to your confirmation and any further input you may have.`

`Best regards,`
