# --explanation--

`To deal with` means to take action to solve or manage a situation or problem. For example:

`We need to deal with the customer complaints immediately.` – This means the complaints should be addressed and handled as soon as possible.

`Early` in this context means at a time before something becomes more serious or difficult. For example:

`It's better to catch problems early before they get worse.` – This means addressing issues at the beginning, rather than waiting until they are bigger problems.
