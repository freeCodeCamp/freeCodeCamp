# --explanation--

`Might` is used to show that something is possible, but not certain. Jessica is saying that the bug *could* cause a problem, but it hasn't been confirmed yet. Compare this with using the `Simple Present`, `we've discovered a critical bug that affects the user interface`, which means the bug definitely causes problems. Other examples:

- `The delay might cause problems.` – It's possible, but not certain.

- `The delay causes problems.` – It definitely creates issues.
