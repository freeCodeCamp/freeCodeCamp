# --explanation--

`To be sorry for something` is used when apologizing for an action that may have caused inconvenience or harm. For example:

`I'm sorry for being late to the meeting.` - This means the speaker regrets arriving late and is apologizing. Notice that `being` is in the `-ing` form as it is right after `for` (a preposition).
