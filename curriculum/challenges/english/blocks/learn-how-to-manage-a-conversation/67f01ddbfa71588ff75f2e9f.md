# --explanation--

`By the way` is used to introduce a new topic or provide additional information that may not be directly related to the current conversation. It often signals a shift to a side topic. For example:

`By the way, did you hear about the new office policy?` â€“ This means the speaker is introducing a new topic (the office policy) that is related but not the main subject of the conversation.
