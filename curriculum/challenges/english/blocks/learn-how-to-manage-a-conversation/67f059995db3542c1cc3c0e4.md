# --explanation--

`Do you know if there's...` is a polite way to ask for information. It uses the affirmative structure (`there is`) inside a question. Instead of directly asking `Is there a timeline?` (which is a standard interrogative form), Sarah asks indirectly with `Do you know if there's a timeline?`, which sounds more polite or tentative. For example:

`Do you know if there's a meeting this afternoon?` â€“ This is a softer way of asking, compared to simply saying `Is there a meeting this afternoon?`
