# --explanation--

`It does, but...` shows agreement with the previous statement while introducing a concern or condition. It's often used when someone accepts an idea but wants to adjust something or add a small request. For example:

- Person 1: `Does the plan make sense to you?` - Here, person 1 is asking if person 2 agrees with a plan they came up with. 

- Person 2: `It does, but I think we need more time.` - This means the person agrees overall but suggests a change.
