# --explanation--

`What's the problem?` is a more direct question and can sometimes sound too strong or impatient, depending on the tone. `What seems to be the problem?` is more polite and indirect. It's often used when asking about a situation you don't fully understand yet, especially in customer service or professional settings. For example:

`The technician asked, "What seems to be the problem with your laptop?"` â€“ This sounds more neutral and respectful than simply asking, `What's the problem with your laptop?`
