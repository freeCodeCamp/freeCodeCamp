<!-- (Audio) Alice: We need to adjust the timeline because of the recent changes. Does that work for you? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What short answer could James give to say he is okay with the adjustment without using `yes` or `no`?

## --answers--

`It does.`

---

`It might.`

### --feedback--

Although this answer is affirmative, it does not fully agree with what Alice is asking.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Short answers like `It does.` are commonly used to confirm something without repeating the full sentence or using `yes` or `no`. Instead of saying `Yes, it works for me.` or simply `Yes, it does.`, the response is shortened to `It does.` Another example:

- Person 1: `Does this solve the problem?` - This person is asking if something is a good solution.

- Person 2: `It does.` - This confirms that the solution works without restating the entire sentence.
