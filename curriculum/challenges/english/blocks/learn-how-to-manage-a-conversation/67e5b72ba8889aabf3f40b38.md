# --explanation--

`How` + adjective + `is it?` is used to ask about the degree/intensity of something. It helps to find out how strong, serious, or intense something is. For example:

- `How difficult is the test?` – This asks about the level of difficulty of the test.

- `How expensive is the car?` – This asks about the price level of the car.
