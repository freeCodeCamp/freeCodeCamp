# --explanation--

`A few` is used as a quantifier to indicate a small number of things. It suggests that something is present, but not in large amounts. It typically refers to a small quantity of countable nouns. For example:

`We encountered a few problems during the meeting, but we solved them quickly.` â€“ This means that there were a small number of problems, but they were manageable.
