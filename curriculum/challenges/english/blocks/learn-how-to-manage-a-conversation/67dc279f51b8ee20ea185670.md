# --explanation--

The `Past Continuous` tense (`was/were` + verb in the `-ing` form) is used to describe actions that were in progress at a specific moment in the past. In this case, `We were talking` shows that the conversation was happening when an interruption occurred. Another example:

`I was writing an email when my phone rang.` - This means the action of writing was already happening when it was interrupted by the phone ringing.
