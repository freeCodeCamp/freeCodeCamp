# --explanation--

When someone makes a polite request using `Would it be okay to...`, there are different ways to say `yes` or give permission. For example:

- `Sure.` – A short, friendly way to agree.  

- `Of course.` – A more enthusiastic way to say yes.  

- `That's fine.` – A calm, neutral response.  

- `Go ahead.` – A way to invite the person to continue.
