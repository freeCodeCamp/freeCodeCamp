# --explanation--

`To address` means to take action to deal with a problem or situation. For example:

`We need to address the login error before users report it.` – This means action needs to be taken to fix the issue.

`Quickly` expresses how fast something is done. `Quick`, on the other hand, simply describes something as being fast. For example:

- `She responded quickly to the email.` – You use `quickly` to describe how fast she responded to the email.  

- `It was a quick meeting.` – Here, you are describing the meeting itself as having taken a short, reasonable time.
