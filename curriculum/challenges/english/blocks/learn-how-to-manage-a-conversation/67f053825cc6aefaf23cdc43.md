# --explanation--

`We've had` is the contraction of `we have had`, which is in the `Present Perfect` tense. 

This structure is used to talk about past experiences or situations that are still relevant or connected to the present. 

In this case, `we've had some issues` means that the team experienced problems in the past, and those problems may still be affecting them now. For example:

`We've had several delays this week due to bad weather.` â€“ This means the delays started earlier in the week and could still be happening now.
