## --sentence--

`If you don't mind, I'd like to take a BLANK minutes to explain it to the rest of the team.`

## --blanks--

`few`

### --feedback--

Preceded by `a`, this is used with countable nouns (like `minutes`) and means a small number.

# --explanation--

`A few` is used to talk about a small number of **countable** things. For example:

`We have a few tasks left to finish.` – You use `a few`, since `tasks` is a countable noun.

`To take a little time` means to spend a small amount of time doing something. `Time` is an **uncountable** noun, so you use `a little`, not `a few`. For example:

`I need a little time to review this.` – You use `a little`, since `time` is an uncountable noun.

Other examples of usage:

- `A few minutes` – `Minutes` are countable.

- `A little water` – `Water` is uncountable.

- `A few emails` – `Emails` are countable.

- `A little information` – `Information` is uncountable.
