# --explanation--

`So we can` is used to show purpose — it means the next thing you mention is what you intend to do. It explains why someone is doing something. For example:

`I'll finish this now so we can start the next task.` – This means the speaker wants to finish one thing to begin another soon.

`The main agenda` refers to the primary topics or plan of a meeting or event. For example:

`Let's stick to the main agenda and avoid side discussions.` – This means to stay focused on the most important items in the meeting.
