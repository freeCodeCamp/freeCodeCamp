After the check-in with Sarah, Brian decides to write to Bob, from management, to update him on the situation.

`Subject: Quick Update â€“ Resources, Integration Issues, and Training`

`Dear Bob,`

`I wanted to share a short update after speaking with Sarah about the ongoing project.`

`The team is making progress, but there are some challenges. Some parts of the project are taking longer than expected. One reason is the new software integration. It is not as smooth as they hoped, but the team is working on it. Sarah will plan a meeting to talk more about the integration problems.`

`She also asked about the extra resources we requested. I know it is still being discussed, but any updates would help the team.`

`Finally, Sarah mentioned the new training sessions. She said the team could use a refresher on the new tools. Are the sessions still planned for next week?`

`Please let me know if I can help with anything else.`

`Best regards,`

`Brian`
