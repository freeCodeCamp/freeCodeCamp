# --explanation--

`Anything` in this sentence means any possible thing or situation. It contrasts with `something`, which is more specific and often used when you already have a particular idea in mind. For example:  

`If anything changes, I'll contact you right away.` â€“ This means the speaker is ready to respond to any possible change, not just a specific one.
