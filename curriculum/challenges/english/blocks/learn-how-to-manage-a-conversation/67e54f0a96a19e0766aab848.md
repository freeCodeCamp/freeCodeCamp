`To be okay` means to be acceptable or permitted. For example:

`Briefly` means that an action (normally, a verb) happens for a short period of time or is talked about using in a few words. It differs from `brief`, which is an adjective to describe something that is short in duration or length. For example:

- `He explained the situation briefly.` – This means the act of explaining was short.

- `The meeting was brief.` – This means the meeting did not last long.
