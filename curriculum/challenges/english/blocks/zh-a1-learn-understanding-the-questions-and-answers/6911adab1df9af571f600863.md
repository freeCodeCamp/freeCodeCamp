# --explanation--

`吗 (ma)` indicates an interrogative mood. It's used at the end of a declarative sentence to change a statement into a question. For example:

`你是开发者。(nǐ shì kāi fā zhě)` is a statement meaning "You are a developer." Adding `吗 (ma)` at the end transforms it into a question: `你是开发者吗？(nǐ shì kāi fā zhě ma)`, which means "Are you a developer?"
