`你是` means "you are". You can use the structure `你是 (nǐ shì)` + nationality to talk about the nationality of the person you are speaking to. For example:

`你是美国人吗？(nǐ shì měi guó rén ma)` – Are you American?

Similarly, you can use `你是 (nǐ shì)` + name or profession to talk about the other person's name or profession. Examples:

`你是刘明吗？(nǐ shì liú míng ma)` – Are you Liu Ming?

`你是开发者吗？(nǐ shì kāi fā zhě ma)` – Are you a developer?
