# --explanation--

`你 (nǐ)` means "you". It's used to talk directly to another person. For example:

`你是刘明吗 (nǐ shì Liu Ming ma)？` – Are you Liu Ming?

You've learned how to use `我 (wǒ)` to refer to yourself. Both `我 (wǒ)` and `你 (nǐ)` are **personal pronouns**, which means they are used to refer to people.
