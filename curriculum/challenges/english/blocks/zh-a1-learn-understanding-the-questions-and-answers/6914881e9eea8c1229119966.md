# --explanation--

`很高兴认识你 (hěn gāo xìng rèn shì nǐ)` means "Nice to meet you." It's a common phrase used when meeting someone for the first time. It shows politeness and friendliness.

An interesting note is that the subject "I" is often omitted in this expression, as it's understood from the context that the speaker is referring to themselves. You can also say `我很高兴认识你 (wǒ hěn gāo xìng rèn shì nǐ)`, which conveys the same meaning as the version without `我 (wǒ)`.
