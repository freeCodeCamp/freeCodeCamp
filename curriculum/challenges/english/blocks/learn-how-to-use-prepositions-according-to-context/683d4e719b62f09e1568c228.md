For advice on where to place the HR department.

If the HR department needs more people.

# --explanation--

Bob is asking for input about the best location for the HR department.

He says `where do you think`, showing he wants Anna's opinion, and `put` suggests a decision still needs to be made.

The question is about placement, not about the department's size, staffing, or condition.
