`Trying to` means making an effort to do something. For example:

`She's trying to finish the report before noon.` – This shows she is working hard to do it.

`Monitor` is a device that displays images and is commonly used with computers. For example:

`He connected a second monitor to his laptop.` – This means he added another screen.

`They've` is the contraction of `they have`. It's the Present Perfect tense which shows an action done before now or a situation that started in the past and continues.​ For example:

`They've moved the files to a new folder.` – This means the files were relocated by them.
