`Isolated` means something is away or separate from other things. For example:  

`The meeting room is isolated from the noisy areas.` – This means it is in a quiet, separate spot.

`Walkways` are paths or corridors that people use to move around a building. For example:  

`The printer is placed near the walkways for easy access.` – This means the printer is close to the paths people use to walk, so it's easy for everyone to reach and use it.
