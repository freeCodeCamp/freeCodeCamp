# --explanation--

The preposition `on` can have many meanings, but in this task, it should be used to show the subject or topic being discussed or worked on.

`Working on the new software update` means the team is focusing their effort and attention on that specific project or topic.

Other sentences use `on` to show time (`on the weekend`, `on time`) or place/device (`on his computer`), which are different uses.
