# --explanation--

Maria says she wants to `go over the resource needs for the next phase of our app development`, showing her main reason is to review what resources will be needed for the next part of the app project.

She also says `make sure everything lined up on time`, meaning she wants to plan ahead to keep the project on schedule.

While she thanks David at the start, that is just a polite opening, not the focus of the conversation.
