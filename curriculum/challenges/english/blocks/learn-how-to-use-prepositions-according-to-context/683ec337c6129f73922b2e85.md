# --explanation--

`Close to` can describe physical distance when one thing is near another.

In the correct sentence, it shows the desk is located near the window, which is a proper and clear example of using `close to` for describing location.

The other options use `close to` in non-physical ways, such as time, progress, or decision-making.
