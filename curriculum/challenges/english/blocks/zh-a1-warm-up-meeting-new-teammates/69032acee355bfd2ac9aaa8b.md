## Tone Sandhi of `不 (bù)`

`不 (bù)` means "no" or "not". When it is followed by a syllable which is in the first, second or the third tone, it remains in the fourth tone.

However, when `不 (bù)` is followed by a syllable which is in the fourth tone, it changes to the second tone.

This tone change is a natural adjustment in speech to make pronunciation smoother.

### Examples

| Written    | Pronounced as |
|------------|----------------|
| `bù néng`   | `bù néng`      |
| `bù xiǎng`   | `bù xiǎng`      |
| `bù shì`    | `bú shì`       |
| `bù huì`  | `bú huì`   |
