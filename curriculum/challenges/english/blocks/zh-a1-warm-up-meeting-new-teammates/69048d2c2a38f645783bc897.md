# --explanation--

Wang Hua is saying `wǒ yě shì`. The first and the second syllables have the third tone, and the third syllable has the fourth tone.

Remember you've learned a Pinyin rule named **Tone Sandhi**? When two third-tone syllables appear together, the first syllable becomes second tone and the second syllable stays the third tone. You write the original tones, but say them differently. That's why `wǒ yě shì` sounds like `wó yě shì`.
