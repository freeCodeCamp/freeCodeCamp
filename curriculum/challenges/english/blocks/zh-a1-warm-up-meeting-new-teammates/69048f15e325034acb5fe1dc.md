# --explanation--

`我 (wǒ)` means "I", `也 (yě)` means "also" or "too", and `是 (shì)` means "to be". Together, they form a phrase `我也是 (wǒ yě shì)` that naturally expresses similarity in conversations.

For example, if someone says `我很开心认识你 (wǒ hěn kāi xīn rèn shì nǐ)` meaning "I am very happy to meet you", responding with `我也是 (wǒ yě shì)` indicates that you also feel happy to meet them.
