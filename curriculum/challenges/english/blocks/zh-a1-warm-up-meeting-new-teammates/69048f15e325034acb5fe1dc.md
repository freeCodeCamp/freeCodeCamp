# --explanation--

`我 (wǒ)` means "I", `也 (yě)` means "also" or "too", and `是 (shì)` means "to be". Together, they form a phrase `我也是 (Wǒ yě shì)` that naturally expresses agreement or similarity in conversations.

For example, when someone says "I am a designer", you can respond with `我也是 (Wǒ yě shì)` to mean "I am also a designer".
