# --interactive--

In HTML, form controls, like inputs, can be in different stages or conditions like a `focused` state, `readonly` state, or `disabled` state.

The first state would be considered the `default` state. The default state of an email address input is a blank input. That is what the email input looks like when it is first rendered on the page. 

:::interactive_editor

```html
<input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
```

When the user clicks on a form control or selects it with the keyboard's tab key, then that means it is in the `focused` state. When an input is in the `focused` state, most browsers will show a blue highlighted border around the input. But you can choose to add additional styles in CSS.

Click on any part of the whitespace in the preview window and then press the `tab` key to see the focus state.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<input type="email" name="email" id="email" />
```

:::

Another form state is the `disabled` state. This state shows users that an input cannot be focused or activated. 

Try clicking on the email input and you will notice that it will not focus anymore.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<input disabled type="email" name="email" id="email" />
```

:::

Similar to the `focused` state, you can choose to add additional styles for the `disabled` state using CSS.

Another type of form state is the `readonly` state. This is when a form control, like an input, is not editable by the user. Here is an example of setting an email input to read-only. The `value` attribute is used to set the value shown inside the input field.

Try editing the current value of `example@email.com` in the preview window, and you will notice that is not possible.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<input
  readonly
  type="email"
  name="email"
  id="email"
  value="example@email.com"
/>
```

:::

A key difference between the `disabled` state and `readonly` state is that `readonly` can be focused while the `disabled` state cannot.

Understanding the different form states is important because they ensure a smooth user experience by providing clear feedback and guidance while handling errors.
