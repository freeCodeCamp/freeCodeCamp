# --description--

In this workshop, you'll build a Festival Crowd Flow Simulator that manages attendee flow through multiple entrance gates with dynamic capacity changes and congestion handling. You'll practice working with time-based simulations, queue processing, and data structures.

All of the starter data structures for this project have been provided for you.

The morningGates and eveningGates arrays represent two different scenarios. Each gate object contains:

id: A string identifier for the gate (e.g., "North", "East", "West")
capacity: The maximum number of attendees that can be processed per time tick
queue: An array where each index represents a time tick, and the value is the number of attendees arriving at that tick
For example, in morningGates, the North gate has capacity: 5 and queue: [8, 3, 4, 10, 1, 0, 2]. This means at tick 0, 8 attendees arrive; at tick 1, 3 arrive; and so on.

The morningBackups and eveningBackups arrays define backup gate routing. Each index corresponds to a gate in the same position in the gates array, and the value is the ID of the backup gate to use when that gate becomes congested.

The morningCapacityUpdates and eveningCapacityUpdates objects define dynamic capacity changes. The structure is { gateId: { tick: newCapacity } }. For example, North: { 3: 3, 6: 2 } means the North gate's capacity changes to 3 at tick 3, and to 2 at tick 6.

When you're ready to get started, use console.log() to log the morningGates array to see its structure.

```js
const morningGates = [
  { id: 'North', capacity: 5, queue: [8, 3, 4, 10, 1, 0, 2] },
  { id: 'East', capacity: 4, queue: [4, 6, 0, 2, 8, 3, 1] },
  { id: 'West', capacity: 3, queue: [2, 5, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0] }
];

const eveningGates = [
  { id: 'North', capacity: 4, queue: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2] },
  { id: 'East', capacity: 3, queue: [1, 1, 1, 5, 0, 0] },
  { id: 'West', capacity: 2, queue: [0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3] }
];


const morningBackups = ['West'];
const eveningBackups = ['East'];

const morningCapacityUpdates = {
  North: { 3: 3, 6: 2 },
  East: { 4: 6 },
  West: { 2: 1 }
};
const eveningCapacityUpdates = { North: { 5: 2 }, East: {}, West: { 3: 4 } };
```
