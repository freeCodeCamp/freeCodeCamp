# --interactive--

In prior lessons you were first introduced to the `length` property, this property returns the number of elements in an array. So here is a quick reminder on how it works:

:::interactive_editor

```js
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
console.log(fruits.length); // 3
```

It's possible to have arrays with empty slots. Empty slots are defined as slots with nothing in them. This is different than an array with the value of `undefined`. These types of arrays are known as sparse arrays. Here is an example:

```js
const sparseArray = [1, , , 4];
console.log(sparseArray.length); // 4
console.log(sparseArray); // [1, , , 4]
```

In this case even though we only have two defined elements, `1` and `4`. The length is `4` because the highest index (`3`) plus `1` gives us a length of `4`.

Now let's discuss how to create an empty array of fixed length. There are few ways to do this in JavaScript but one common method is to use the `Array()` constructor with a numeric argument. The `Array()` constructor can be used with the `new` keyword to create a new array. Here is an example:

```js
const emptyArray = new Array(5);
console.log(emptyArray.length); // 5
console.log(emptyArray); // [ , , , , ]
```

In this example, we create a new array using the `Array(5)`. This creates a sparse array with a length of `5` where all the slots are empty. Note that these are *empty slots* (sparse slots) — they are not actual values of `undefined` stored at each index. Many JS inspectors display empty slots visually as blank positions separated by commas (`,`) — e.g. `[ , , , ]`.

Another way to create an empty array of fixed length is to use the `Array.from()` method with a length argument. This method creates an array of the specified length with all elements initialized to `undefined`: 

:::interactive_editor

```js
const fixedLengthArray = Array.from({ length: 5 });
console.log(fixedLengthArray.length); // 5

// [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined]
console.log(fixedLengthArray);
```

> Note: `Array.from({ length: n })` creates a real array with `n` entries that are set to `undefined`, while `new Array(n)` creates a sparse array with `n` empty slots. The two look different in runtime inspectors: `Array.from` will show explicit `undefined` values, while `new Array(n)` often displays as `[ , , , ]`.

If you want to create an array of specific length and fill it with a default value, you can use the `Array.fill()` method: 

:::interactive_editor

```js
const filledArray = new Array(3).fill(0);
console.log(filledArray); // [0, 0, 0]
```

This creates an array of length three and fills all elements with the value `0`.

Understanding how to get the length of an array and create arrays of fixed length is important for many programming tasks especially when you need to initialize arrays for specific algorithms or data structures.

# --questions--

## --text--

What will be the output of the following code?

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3, , 5];
console.log(arr.length);
```

## --answers--

`4`

### --feedback--

Remember that the `length` property returns the highest numeric index plus one, even if there are empty slots.

---

`5`

### --feedback--

Correct. The highest index in `[1, 2, 3, , 5]` is `4`, so length is `4 + 1 = 5`. Empty slots count toward the array's `length` even though they are not filled with values.

---

`3`

### --feedback--

Remember that the `length` property returns the highest numeric index plus one, even if there are empty slots.

---

This will throw an error.

### --feedback--

Remember that the `length` property returns the highest numeric index plus one, even if there are empty slots.

## --text--

What will be the output of the following code?

```js
let arr = new Array(3);
console.log(arr);
```

## --answers--

`[ , , ]`

### --feedback--

Correct. `new Array(3)` creates a sparse array with three empty slots. Many JS environments display sparse slots as blank entries between commas (e.g. `[ , , ]`). These are empty slots, not explicit `undefined` values.

---

`[undefined, undefined, undefined]`

### --feedback--

This is what an array created by `Array.from({ length: 3 })` would look like when printed — `Array.from` creates defined entries set to `undefined`. `new Array(3)` instead creates three empty slots (a sparse array).

---

`[3]`

### --feedback--

`new Array(3)` does not create an array containing the single element `3`. Passing a single numeric argument to the `Array` constructor sets the length to that number (a sparse array).

---

`[<3 empty items>]`

### --feedback--

Some environments display sparse arrays using a notation such as `[ <3 empty items> ]`. This is another visual representation that indicates three empty slots. The lesson prefers the CodePen-style `[ , , ]` for clarity in examples.

## --text--

What will be the output of the following code?

```js
let arr = new Array(3).fill(1);
console.log(arr);
```

## --answers--

`[1, 1, 1]`

`[3]`

### --feedback--

The `fill()` method fills all the elements of an array with a static value.

---

`[undefined, undefined, undefined]`

### --feedback--

The `fill()` method fills all the elements of an array with a static value.

---

`[<3 empty items>]`

### --feedback--

The `fill()` method fills all the elements of an array with a static value.
