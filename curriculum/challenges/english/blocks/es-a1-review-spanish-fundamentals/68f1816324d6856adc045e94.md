It's time to review the Spanish alphabet and special characters.

## Spanish Alphabet

Take a moment to read this table. It shows each letter with its uppercase and lowercase forms, as well as its name.

| m         | M         | eme       |
| n         | N         | ene       |
| ñ         | Ñ         | eñe       |
| o         | O         | o         |
| p         | P         | pe        |
| q         | Q         | cu        |
| r         | R         | erre      |
| s         | S         | ese       |
| t         | T         | te        |
| u         | U         | u         |
| v         | V         | ve pequeña|
| w         | W         | doble ve  |
| x         | X         | equis     |
| y         | Y         | ye        |
| z         | Z         | zeta      |

Please note that some of these names are common in Latin America, but they may vary across regions.

## Special Characters

In Spanish, questions and exclamations are marked with opening and closing punctuation marks.

While some languages only need the closing question mark (`?`) or exclamation point (`!`), Spanish also requires an inverted question mark (`¿`) at the beginning of a question and an inverted exclamation point (`¡`) at the beginning of an exclamation. For example:

- For a question, you would write `¿Cómo estás?` ("How are you?").

- For an exclamation, you would write `¡Gracias!` ("Thank you!").

The opening punctuation marks are helpful to anticipate the tone and structure of the sentence from the start.

## The First Ten Numbers

| Digit | Spanish | English |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 0 | `Cero` | Zero |
| 1 | `Uno` | One |
| 2 | `Dos` | Two |
| 3 | `Tres` | Three |
| 4 | `Cuatro` | Four |
| 5 | `Cinco` | Five |
| 6 | `Seis` | Six |
| 7 | `Siete` | Seven |
| 8 | `Ocho` | Eight |
| 9 | `Nueve` | Nine |
