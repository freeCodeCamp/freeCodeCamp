# --explanation--

`我是中国人 (wǒ shì zhōng guó rén)` uses the structure `我是 (wǒ shì)` + nationality to state where someone is from.

`我是 (wǒ shì)` means "I am...". A nationality is formed by adding `人 (rén)`, meaning "person", to the country name.

`中国 (zhōng guó)` means "China", so `中国人 (zhōng guó rén)` means a person from China.

Therefore, Wang Hua is saying she is Chinese.
