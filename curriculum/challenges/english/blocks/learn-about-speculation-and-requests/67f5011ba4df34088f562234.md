# --explanation--

`Might` shows possibility. Jessica is not sure, but she thinks it is possible they missed something.

`Missed` means they did not notice or check something. For example:

`The team missed a small error in the code.` â€“ This means the error was there, but no one saw it.

Jessica wants to check the firewall settings again to see if anything was missed.
