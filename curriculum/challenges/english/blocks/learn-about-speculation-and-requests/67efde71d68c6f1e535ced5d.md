# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, listen for the key words in Jessica's sentence: `what might have caused it.`

The word `caused` indicates she wants to talk about the reason for the problem.

She doesn't mention `fixing` it, `preventing` future issues, or `who reported` the breach â€” only the possible cause.
