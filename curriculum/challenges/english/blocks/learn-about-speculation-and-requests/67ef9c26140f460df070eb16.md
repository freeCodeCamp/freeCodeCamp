# --explanation--

Mark is taking responsibility for his mistakes and plans to fix them.

`Correct the code` means to fix errors in the program. For example:

`She needs to correct the code to fix the error.` - She has to fix the code because there's an issue.

`Run the tests` means to check if the program works correctly. For example:

`He always runs the tests after every update.` - He runs tests regularly to check for any problems after making updates.
