# --explanation--

Brian says he'll `revise` the plan with more hands-on activities — so he's adding, not removing or replacing.

`Revise` means to change or improve something — usually by looking at it again and making updates. For example:

- `The team decided to revise the training plan.` - They want to make changes to improve it.

- `He revised the report after getting feedback.` - He changed it based on suggestions.
