`Weak passwords` are passwords that are easy to guess or crack. For example:

`123456 and qwerty are weak passwords.` - A strong password should be long and contain letters, numbers, and symbols.

`Shared credentials` are login details (username and password) that are used by multiple people. For example:

`Using shared credentials increases security risks.` - Sharing passwords can lead to unauthorized access if they fall into the wrong hands.
