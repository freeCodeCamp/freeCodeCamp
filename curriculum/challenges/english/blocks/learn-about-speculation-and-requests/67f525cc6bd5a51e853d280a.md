# --explanation--

`Sounds good` is a casual way to say `I agree` or `That works for me`.

`Keep me posted` means `Let me know if there are any updates`. It is a polite way to ask for ongoing information about a situation. For example:

- `If you find any issues with the system, keep me posted.` - You're asking someone to let you know if they discover any problems with the system.

- `Keep me posted if you get any feedback from the client.` - You're asking someone to let you know if they hear anything new from the client.
