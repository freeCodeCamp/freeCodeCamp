# --explanation--

Alice agrees with Brian's plan and thinks it will have a big impact.

`Will do` is a casual way to say `I will do it`, and `I think` is used before sharing an opinion or idea. For example:

- Person 1: `Can you update the software before the meeting?`

- Person 2: `Will do. I think it will only take a couple of hours.` - This person responds with `Will do.`, meaning they'll do it, and then adds `I think...` to give their estimate of how long it might take.
