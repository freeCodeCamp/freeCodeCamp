# --explanation--

When answering a question that starts with `could`, you can use:

- `It might be.` - There is a chance.

- `It could be.` - It is possible.

- `It must be.` - You are sure it is true.

Jake's answer, `It might be`, means he thinks there is a possibility that something else caused the breach.
