<!-- (audio) Sophie: The for loop might not account for all the edge cases, which could lead to unexpected behavior. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What might be a result of using the `for` loop, according to Sophie?

## --answers--

The loop will always execute the correct number of times.

### --feedback--

If the loop doesn't account for all conditions, it might skip important cases or stop too soon.

---

The program will never run into any issues.

### --feedback--

A `for` loop that doesn't handle edge cases properly can lead to unexpected errors or logic mistakes.

---

The code will immediately crash.

### --feedback--

While it might cause problems, unexpected behavior doesn't always mean a crash â€” it can also mean incorrect outputs or skipped steps.

---

The program might produce results that are different from what is expected.

# --explanation--

`Unexpected behavior` refers to results that differ from what was intended. This can include errors, incorrect calculations, or skipping important cases. Some examples of unexpected behavior in loops are:

- `Incorrect output` - The program runs but gives wrong results.

- `Infinite repetition` - The loop runs forever.

- `Unexpected termination` - The loop might cause an error that stops execution.

- `System crash` - Rare, but possible with memory-related issues.
