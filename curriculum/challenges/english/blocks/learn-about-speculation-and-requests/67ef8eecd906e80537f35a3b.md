# --explanation--

`Should have` is used to express regret or a missed responsibility about something in the past. Mark means that running the tests was the right thing to do, but he didn't do it.

`But` introduces the reason why he didn't act: `I was in a hurry`. Another example:

`We should have fixed the bug, but we didn't notice it.` - They wish they had fixed the bug, but they missed it.
