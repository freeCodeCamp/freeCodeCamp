# --questions--

## --text--

Why is it important to run a test suite?

## --answers--

It slows down the coding process.

### --feedback--

Running tests might take some time, but it prevents bigger issues later.

---

It helps find errors before they cause bigger problems.

---

It makes the code shorter.

### --feedback--

A test suite does not change the length of the code.

---

It removes all bugs from the code.

### --feedback--

Tests help find bugs, but they don't guarantee a program is perfect.

# --explanation--

To understand the correct answer, listen to what Sophie says: `It would have caught the error early on and saved you some time.`

She uses the phrase `would have caught`, which shows that Mark could have found the error earlier, but this **didnâ€™t** happen. Here's another example: 

`If you had run the test suite, it would have found the missing bracket.` - This means running a test suite helps you find issues early and avoid wasting time later.
