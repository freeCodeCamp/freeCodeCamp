# --explanation--

`Could` is often used in questions to politely ask for assistance. It makes the request sound more polite and less direct than `can`.

Alice is asking for help in choosing the topics for the training session. She could also say:

- `Can you help me?` - Direct way.

- `Could you help me?` - More polite way.

- `I was hoping you could help me.` - Even softer and more polite way.
