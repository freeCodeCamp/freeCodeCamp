## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Totally agree` means full or strong agreement. `Totally` is an adverb that makes the agreement stronger.

- `I agree` is basic agreement.

- `Totally agree` is strong, enthusiastic agreement.

Brian is not just saying he agrees â€” he is completely on board with Alice's idea. This shows support and confidence in the suggestion to make training more interactive.
