# --explanation--

To understand Brian's reason, listen for the phrase `especially after that recent security breach.`

A `security breach` is when someone breaks into a system or gets access without permission.

Brian says this happened recently. That is why he wants to focus on `security best practices` â€” the steps people should follow to keep systems safe.
