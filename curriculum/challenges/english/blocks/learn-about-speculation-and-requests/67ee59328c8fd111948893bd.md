# --explanation--

Sophie says, `You should have used a while loop`.

`Should have` + `Past Participle` is used to talk about a mistake or something that should have been done differently. For example:

- `I should have studied more for the test.` - You didn't study enough, and that was a mistake.

- `You should have called me earlier.` - Someone didn't call you earlier, and you think they should have.
