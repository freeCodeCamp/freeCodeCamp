## --blanks--

`code submission`

### --feedback--

---

`loop structure`

### --feedback--

This two-word phrase means a programming pattern that repeats a block of code multiple times until a specified condition is met.

# --explanation--

A `code submission` is the set of code files that a programmer submits for review. For example:

- `Make sure your code submission follows the guidelines.` - The code must meet the rules before you send it.

- `The professor reviewed my code submission and gave feedback.` - The professor checked your code and shared comments.

A `loop structure` executes a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is satisfied, saving time by automating repetitive tasks, such as `for` loops or `while` loops. For example:

- `The loop structure in my code runs five times.` - Your loop repeats five times in the program.

- `A loop structure allows a program to repeat actions.` - A loop helps a program do the same thing multiple times.
