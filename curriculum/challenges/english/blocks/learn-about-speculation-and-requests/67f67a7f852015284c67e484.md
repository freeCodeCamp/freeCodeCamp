After their discussion, Alice and Brian decided to collaborate and write an article on training sessions:

`How to Improve Training Sessions`

`Training sessions should be engaging and practical to ensure better learning outcomes. Instead of just explaining best practices, incorporating hands-on exercises can help participants apply their knowledge in real-life situations.`

`Encouraging peer-to-peer learning allows team members to share experiences and solutions, promoting a collaborative environment. Adding interactive discussions where developers can ask questions and discuss common challenges makes training more effective.`

`A good approach is to start with a recap of past issues—like a security breach—to highlight what went wrong and how to avoid similar mistakes. Revising the training plan with real-world scenarios can make a big difference.`

`By making sessions more interactive, teams can retain knowledge better and improve overall performance.`
