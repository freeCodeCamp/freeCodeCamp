# --explanation--

`Could` shows possibility. It means he is not sure but is suggesting one possible cause.

`Unpatched` means something has not been fixed or updated. For example:

`The system was attacked because of an unpatched vulnerability.` â€“ This means a known problem in the system was not corrected, and that allowed the attack to happen.
