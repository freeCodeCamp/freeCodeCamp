# --explanation--

A `suspicious email` is an email that looks untrustworthy or dangerous. It could be part of a `phishing attack`, where someone tries to steal information. For example:

`This looks like a suspicious email. Can you check it?` - You think the email might be dangerous and ask someone to look at it.
