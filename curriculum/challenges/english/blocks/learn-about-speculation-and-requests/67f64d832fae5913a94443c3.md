# --explanation--

To understand Alice's idea, listen for the phrase `to see how best practices are applied in real-life situations.`

This means she wants developers to experience examples where they can use good security habits in realistic tasks.

By working through scenarios, they can understand how best practices work in practice, not just in theory.
