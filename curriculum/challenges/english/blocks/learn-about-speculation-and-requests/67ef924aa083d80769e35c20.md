# --explanation--

`Make it a habit` means to do something regularly until it becomes automatic. For example:

- `Try to make it a habit to write clean code.` - You should regularly write easy-to-read code.

- `She made it a habit to learn one new programming tip every week.` - She learns regularly as part of her routine.

Mark wants to test his code every time so that he won't forget to do it in the future.
