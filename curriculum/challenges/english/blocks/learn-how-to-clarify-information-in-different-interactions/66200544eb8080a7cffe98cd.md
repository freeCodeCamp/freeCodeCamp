<!-- (Audio) Tom: She's a colleague with long wavy brown hair and bright brown eyes. -->

# --description--

A `colleague` is a person you work with at your job. You and your colleagues might do similar work and help each other. If you are a teacher, for instance, other teachers at your school are your `colleagues`.

# --questions--

## --text--

What relationship does Tom have with Lisa?

## --answers--

She's his girlfriend

### --feedback--

There's nothing indicating that in the dialogue.

He doesn't know her

### --feedback--

He offers a description of Lisa to Alice, so he probably knows her.

---

They are friends

### --feedback--

That's a possibility, but Tom does not indicate that by what he's saying.

They are workmates
