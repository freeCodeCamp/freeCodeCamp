<!-- (Audio) Alice: Oh, I think I saw her. What does she do on the team? -->

# --description--

It's important to make a distinction between actions described in the `Simple Present` tense and those described in the `Present Continuous` tense. If you say `I work as a developer` (`Simple Present`), you want to inform the other person that this is your occupation. If you say `I am working on a project` (`Present Continuous`), you are informing the person what your current task or activity is.

In a question, you make this distinction by asking `What do you do?` (`Simple Present`, used to ask about a person's career or occupation) or `What are you doing?` (`Present Continuous`, used to ask about the other person's current activity). When referring to another person, use `What does he/she do?` or `What do they do?` (more general and avoids determining a gender to the other person) to know about another person's job and `What is he/she doing?` or `What are they doing?` to know about another person's activity at the moment.

# --questions--

## --text--

Based on the explanation, what does Alice want to know about Lisa?

## --answers--

She wants to know if Lisa is married

### --feedback--

Lisa's marital status has nothing to do with Alice's question.

---

She wants to know what Alice is doing at the moment.

### --feedback--

If that was the case, she would use `What is he/she doing?` or `What are they doing?` instead.

---

She wants to know if Lisa is part of the team

### --feedback--

Even though the team is mentioned, that's not what Alice is asking about.

---

She wants to know Lisa's role in the team, what her job is
