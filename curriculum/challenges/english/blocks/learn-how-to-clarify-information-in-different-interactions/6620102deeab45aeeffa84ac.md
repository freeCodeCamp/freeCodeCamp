<!-- (Audio) Tom: She's a colleague with long wavy brown hair and bright brown eyes. -->

# --description--

When describing the color of a person's eyes, you normally identify them first by their color. Common eye colors are `black`, `brown`, `blue`, and `green`. Depending on the color if can have a tendency to `white` or to `black` (the color itself is stronger or weaker). In this case, you can add the words `light` (tending to `white`) and `dark` (tending to `black`) before the color to express it. Another characteristic that you normally use to identify another person's eyes is the shape - `round` when it is more like a circle and `narrow` when it is more similar to a line. Finally, you can refer to them in terms of their size, `large` (when they are big) or `small` (when they are not). Tom also expresses an opinion, saying Lisa's eyes are full of energy and vitality. In this case, you say one's eyes is `bright`.

As you do with `hair`, the adjectives to identify a person's eyes also follow an order in English. First, you express this opinion, then move on to the size, then the shape and finally the color (preceded or not by `light` or `dark`).

Example: `Tom has beautiful, small, narrow, light green eyes.`

Now listen and fill in the blanks with Tom's description of Lisa's eyes.
