## What Is the Attribute Selector, and How Can It Be Used to Target Links with the `href` and `title` Attributes?

The CSS attribute selector lets you style elements based on the presence or value of their attributes.

- Target any link that has an `href` attribute (i.e., clickable links):

```css
a[href] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

- Target links that include a `title` attribute (often indicates extra info/tooltip):

```css
a[title] {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

- Target links that have both `href` and `title` attributes:

```css
a[href][title] {
  color: green;
}
```

- Match a single value in a space-separated list (e.g., classes):

```css
a[class~="primary"] {
  color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

- Match attribute values by prefix or suffix:

```css
/* href starts with https:// */
a[href^="https://"] {
  color: green;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

/* href ends with .jpg */
a[href$=".jpg"] {
  color: darkgreen;
  text-decoration: underline dotted;
}
```

## Working with Different Attribute Selectors and Links

- **Definition**: The `attribute` selector allows you to target HTML elements based on their attributes like the `href` or `title` attributes.

```css
a[href] {
  color: blue;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

- **`title` Attribute**: This attribute provides additional information about an element. Here is how you can target links with the `title` attribute:

```css
a[title] {
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}
```

## Targeting Elements with the `lang` and `data-lang` Attribute

- **`lang` Attribute**: This attribute is used in HTML to specify the language of the content within an element. You might want to style elements differently based on the language they are written in, especially on a multilingual website. 

```css
p[lang="en"] {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

- **`data-lang` Attribute**: Custom data attributes like the `data-lang` attribute are commonly used to store additional information in elements, such as specifying the language used within a specific section of text. Here is how you can style elements based on the `data-lang` attribute:

```css
div[data-lang="fr"] {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Working with the Attribute Selector, Ordered List Elements and the `type` Attribute

- **`type` Attribute**: When working with ordered lists in HTML, the `type` attribute allows you to specify the style of numbering used, such as numerical, alphabetical, or Roman numerals. 

```css
/*Example targeting uppercase alphabetical numbering*/
ol[type="A"] {
  color: purple;
  font-weight: bold;
}

/*Example targeting lowercase Roman numerals*/
ol[type="i"] {
  color: green;
}
```
