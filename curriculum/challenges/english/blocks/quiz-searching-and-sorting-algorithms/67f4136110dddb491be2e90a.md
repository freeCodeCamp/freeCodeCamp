Break-down-and-solve

---

Divide-and-solve

---

Break-down-and-conquer

#### --answer--

Divide-and-conquer

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the space complexity of the linear search algorithm?

#### --distractors--

`O(n)`

---

`O(log n)`

---

`O(n²)`

#### --answer--

`O(1)`

### --question--

#### --text--

#### --distractors--

Both

---

Linear search

---

None

#### --answer--

Binary search

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the space complexity of binary search?

#### --distractors--

`O(log n)`

---

`O(n)`

---

`O(n log n)`

#### --answer--

`O(1)`

### --question--

#### --text--

What does the binary search algorithm return when it finds the target item?

#### --distractors--

The value of the target item.

---

The size of the list searched.

---

A boolean value of the target.

#### --answer--

The index of the target item.

### --question--

#### --text--

What does the linear search algorithm return if it doesn't find the target item?

#### --distractors--

`0`

---

`Null`

---

`Undefined`

#### --answer--

`-1`

### --question--

#### --text--

How does the merge sort algorithm work?

#### --distractors--

It searches for an element by checking each item one by one.

---

It builds a sorted list by repeatedly finding the smallest element.

---

It swaps adjacent elements until the list is sorted.

#### --answer--

It recursively splits the list into smaller items, then merges them in sorted order.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the condition for a binary search to work?

#### --distractors--

The list must contain only unique values.

---

The list must have an even number of elements.

---

The list must contain no negative numbers.

#### --answer--

The list must be sorted.

### --question--

#### --text--

Which computer science approach is used to implement the merge sort algorithm?

#### --distractors--

Dynamic programming

---

Greedy algorithm

---

Tracing

#### --answer--

Divide-and-conquer
