# --description--

Congratulations! You're almost done with this module.

The article below will help you review some key grammar points covered in the tasks, so you can feel confident before taking the Module Quiz.

Once you've read it, just mark the task as complete and move on to the next part of the review.

## Ask Questions and Answers

### Using `请问 (qǐng wèn)` to Ask Questions Politely

`请问 (qǐng wèn)` means "excuse me" or "may I ask". It's a polite way to start a question and is commonly used to show respect. Examples:

- `请问你叫什么名字 (qǐng wèn nǐ jiào shén me míng zi)？` – Excuse me, what is your name?

- `请问 (qǐng wèn)，你是设计师吗 (nǐ shì shè jì shī ma)？` – Excuse me, are you a designer?

<br />

### Forming a Question with `吗 (ma)`

Adding the particle `吗 (ma)` to the end of a declarative sentence makes it a question. Examples:

- Declarative: `你是设计师 (nǐ shì shè jì shī)。` – You are a designer.

- Question: `你是设计师吗 (nǐ shì shè jì shī ma)？` – Are you a designer?

<br />

### Giving a Positive or Negative Answer

There are two ways to answer a question made with `吗 (ma)`. The positive answer is `是的 (shì de)`, which means "yes" or "that's right". The negative answer is `不是 (bù shì)`, which means "no" or "is not". Examples:

Speaker A: `你是设计师吗 (nǐ shì shè jì shī ma)？` – Are you a designer?

Speaker B: `是的 (shì de)，我是设计师 (wǒ shì shè jì shī)。` – Yes, I am a designer. / `我不是设计师 (wǒ bù shì shè jì shī)。` – I'm not a designer.

<br />

### Asking Follow-up Questions with `你呢 (nǐ ne)？`

`你呢 (nǐ ne)` is a natural way to ask the person you're speaking to a question about a previously mentioned topic, meaning "How about you?" or "And you?". Examples:

- `我是中国人 (wǒ shì zhōng guó rén)。你呢 (nǐ ne)？` – I am Chinese. And you?

- `我是数据分析师 (wǒ shì shù jù fēn xī shī)。你呢 (nǐ ne)？` – I'm a data analyst. How about you?

<br />

## Using `我叫 (wǒ jiào)` to Introduce Your Name

`我叫 (wǒ jiào)` + name is a commonly used structure to introduce someone's name, similar to `我是 (wǒ shì)` + name. It means "I am called..." or "My name is...".

<br />

## Using `你是 (nǐ shì)` to Talk About Someone You're Speaking to

Just as you use `我是 (wǒ shì)` to describe yourself, you can use `你是 (nǐ shì)` to talk about the person you are speaking to. This structure works with names, nationalities, and professions:

- `你是刘明吗 (nǐ shì liú míng ma)？` – Are you Liu Ming?

- `你是新加坡人吗 (nǐ shì xīn jiā pō rén ma)？` – Are you Singaporean?

- `你是开发者 (nǐ shì kāi fā zhě)。` – You are a developer.

<br />

## Other Useful Expressions

`很高兴认识你 (hěn gāo xìng rèn shì nǐ)` is a common phrase used when meeting someone for the first time. It means "Nice to meet you". The natural response to this is `我也是 (wǒ yě shì)` which means "likewise".
