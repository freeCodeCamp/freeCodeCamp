# --description--

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to <a href="https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks</a>. **Do not copy this demo project**.

**User Stories:**

1. You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
1. Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five
1. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
1. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each)
1. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each)
1. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`
1. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
1. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`
1. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar
1. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
1. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
1. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
1. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query

Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

# --hints--

You should have a `main` element with an `id` of `main-doc`.

```js
const el = document.getElementById('main-doc');
assert.isNotNull(el);
```

You should have at least five `section` elements with a class of `main-section`.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('#main-doc section');
assert.isAtLeast(els.length, 5);
```

All of your `.main-section` elements should be `section` elements.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section');
els.forEach(el => {
  if (el.tagName !== 'SECTION') {
    assert.fail();
  }
});
assert.isAbove(els.length, 0);
```

You should have at least five `.main-section` elements that are descendants of `#main-doc`.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('#main-doc .main-section');
assert.isAtLeast(els.length, 5);
```

The first child of each `.main-section` should be a `header` element.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section');
els.forEach(el => {
  if (el.firstElementChild?.tagName !== 'HEADER') assert.fail();
});
assert.isNotEmpty(els);
```

None of your `header` elements should be empty.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('header');
els.forEach(el => {
  if (el.innerText?.length <= 0) assert.fail();
});
assert.isNotEmpty(els);
```

All of your `.main-section` elements should have an `id`.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section');
els.forEach(el => {
  if (!el.id || el.id === '') assert.fail();
});
assert.isNotEmpty(els);
```

Each `.main-section` should have an `id` that matches the text of its first child, having any spaces in the child's text replaced with underscores (`_`) for the id's.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section');
els.forEach(el => {
  const text = el.firstElementChild?.innerText?.replaceAll(' ', '_');
  if (el.id?.toUpperCase() !== text?.toUpperCase()) assert.fail();
});
assert.isNotEmpty(els);
```

You should have at least 10 `p` elements (total) within your `.main-section` elements.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section p');
assert.isAtLeast(els.length, 10);
```

You should have at least five `code` elements that are descendants of `.main-section` elements.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section code');
assert.isAtLeast(els.length, 5);
```

You should have at least five `li` elements that are descendants of `.main-section` elements.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section li');
assert.isAtLeast(els.length, 5);
```

You should have a `nav` element with an `id` of `navbar`.

```js
const el = document.getElementById('navbar');
assert.isNotNull(el);
assert.strictEqual(el.tagName, 'NAV');
```

Your `#navbar` should have exactly one `header` element within it.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('#navbar header');
assert.lengthOf(els, 1);
```

You should have at least one `a` element with a class of `nav-link`.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('a.nav-link');
assert.isAtLeast(els.length, 1);
```

All of your `.nav-link` elements should be anchor (`a`) elements.

```js
const els = document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link');
els.forEach(el => {
  if (el.tagName !== 'A') assert.fail();
});
assert.isNotEmpty(els);
```

All of your `.nav-link` elements should be in the `#navbar`.

```js
const els1 = document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link');
const els2 = document.querySelectorAll('#navbar .nav-link');
assert.isNotEmpty(els2);
assert.strictEqual(els1.length, els2.length);
```

You should have the same number of `.nav-link` and `.main-section` elements.

```js
const els1 = document.querySelectorAll('.main-section');
const els2 = document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link');
assert.isNotEmpty(els1);
assert.isNotEmpty(els2);
assert.strictEqual(els1.length, els2.length);
```

The `header` element in the `#navbar` should come before any link (`a`) elements also in the `#navbar`.

```js
const navLinks = document.querySelectorAll('#navbar a.nav-link');
const header = document.querySelector('#navbar header');
navLinks.forEach(navLink => {
  if (
    header.compareDocumentPosition(navLink) & Node.DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING
  )
    assert.fail();
});
assert.isNotNull(header);
```

Each `.nav-link` should have text that corresponds to the `header` text of its related `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your `#navbar` should have a `.nav-link` which has the text "Hello world").

```js
const headerText = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.main-section')).map(
  el => el.firstElementChild?.innerText?.trim().toUpperCase()
);
const linkText = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link')).map(el =>
  el.innerText?.trim().toUpperCase()
);
const remainder = headerText.filter(str => linkText.indexOf(str) === -1);

assert.isNotEmpty(headerText);
assert.isNotEmpty(linkText);
assert.isEmpty(remainder);
```

Each `.nav-link` should have an `href` attribute that links to its corresponding `.main-section` (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id).

```js
const hrefValues = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link')).map(el =>
  el.getAttribute('href')
);
const mainSectionIDs = Array.from(
  document.querySelectorAll('.main-section')
).map(el => el.id);
const missingHrefValues = mainSectionIDs.filter(
  str => hrefValues.indexOf('#' + str) === -1
);
assert.isNotEmpty(hrefValues);
assert.isNotEmpty(mainSectionIDs);
assert.isEmpty(missingHrefValues, 0);
```

Your `#navbar` should always be on the left edge of the window.

```js
const el = document.getElementById('navbar');
const left1 = el?.offsetLeft;
assert.isNotNull(el);
assert.isAtLeast(left1, -15);
assert.isAtMost(left1, 15);
```

Your Technical Documentation project should use at least one media query.

```js
const htmlSourceAttr = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('source')).map(el =>
  el.getAttribute('media')
);
const cssCheck = new __helpers.CSSHelp(document).getCSSRules('media');
assert.isTrue(cssCheck.length > 0 || htmlSourceAttr.length > 0);
```

          Welcome to a basic introduction of algebra. In this tutorial, we will
          review some of the more common algebraic concepts.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="definitions">
        <header>Definitions</header>
        <p>
          To start with, let's define some of the more common terms used in
          algebra:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Variable:</b> A variable is an unknown value, usually represented
            by a letter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Expression:</b> Essentially a mathematical object. For the
            purpose of this tutorial, an expression is one part of an equation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Equation:</b> An equation is a mathematical argument in which two
            expressions result in the same value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="examples">
        <header>Examples</header>
        <p>
          Sometimes it is easier to understand the definitions when you have a
          physical example to look at. Here is an example of the above terms.<br /><br />
          <code>x + 5 = 12 </code><br /><br />
          In this above example, we have:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Variable:</b> The variable in the example is "x".</li>
          <li>
            <b>Expression:</b> There are two expressions in this example. They
            are "x+5" and "12".
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Equation:</b> The entire example, "x+5=12", is an equation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="solving_equations">
        <header>Solving Equations</header>
        <p>
          The primary use for algebra is to determine an unknown value, the
          "variable", with the information provided. Continuing to use our
          example from above, we can find the value of the variable "x".<br /><br />
          <code>x + 5 = 12 </code><br /><br />
          In an equation, both sides result in the same value. So you can
          manipulate the two expressions however you need, as long as you
          perform the same operation (or change) to each side. You do this
          because the goal when solving an equation is to
          <b
            >get the variable into its own expression, or by itself on one side
            of the = sign.</b
          ><br />For this example, we want to remove the "+5" so the "x" is
          alone. To do this, we can <em>subtract 5</em>, because subtraction is
          the opposite operation to addition. But remember, we have to perform
          the same operation to both sides of the equation. Now our equation
          looks like this.<br /><br />
          <code>x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5</code><br /><br />
          The equation looks like a mess right now, because we haven't completed
          the operations. We can <b>simplify</b> this equation to make it easier
          to read by performing the operations "5-5" and "12-5". The result
          is:<br /><br />
          <code>x = 7</code><br /><br />
          We now have our solution to this equation!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="solving_equations_ii">
        <header>Solving Equations II</header>
        <p>
          Let us look at a slightly more challenging equation.<br /><br />
          <code>3x + 4 = 13</code><br /><br />
          Again we can start with subtraction. In this case, we want to subtract
          4 from each side of the equation. We will also go ahead and simplify
          with each step. So now we have:<br /><br />
          <code>3x = 9</code><br /><br />
          "3x" translates to "3*x", where the "*" symbol indicates
          multiplication. We use the "*" to avoid confusion, as the "x" is now a
          variable instead of a multiplication symbol. The opposite operation
          for multiplication is division, so we need to
          <b>divide each expression by 3</b>.<br /><br />
          <code>x = 3</code><br /><br />
          And now we have our solution!
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="solving_equations_iii">
        <header>Solving Equations III</header>
        <p>
          Now we are getting in to more complex operations. Here is another
          equation for us to look at:<br /><br />
          <code>x^2 - 8 = 8</code><br /><br />
          Our very first step will be to <b>add</b> 8 to each side. This is
          different from our previous examples, where we had to subtract. But
          remember, our goal is to get the variable alone by performing opposite
          operations.<br /><br />
          <code>x^2 = 16</code><br /><br />
          But what does the "^2" mean? The "^" symbol is used to denote
          exponents in situations where superscript is not available. When
          superscript <b>is</b> available, you would see it as x<sup>2</sup>.
          For the sake of this project, however, we will use the "^" symbol.<br />
          An exponent tells you how many times the base (in our case, "x") is
          multiplied by itself. So, "x^2" would be the same as "x*x". Now the
          opposite function of multiplication is division, but we would have to
          <b>divide both sides by "x"</b>. We do not want to do this, as that
          would put an "x" on the other side of the equation. So instead, we
          need to use the root operation! For an exponent of "2", we call this
          the "square root" and denote it with "√". Our equation is now:
          <br /><br />
          <code>x = √9</code><br /><br />
          Performing a root operation by hand can be a tedious process, so we
          recommend using a calculator when necessary. However, we are lucky in
          that "9" is a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number"
            >perfect square</a
          >, so we do not need to calculate anything. Instead, we find our
          answer to be:<br /><br />
          <code>x = 3</code>
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="system_of_equations">
        <header>System of Equations</header>
        <p>
          As you explore your algebra studies further, you may start to run
          across equations with more than one variable. The first such equations
          will likely look like:<br /><br />
          <code>y = 3x</code><br /><br />
          An equation like this does <b>not have one single solution</b>.
          Rather, there are a series of values for which the equation is true.
          For example, if "x=3" and "y=9", the equation is true. These equations
          are usually used to plot a graph. <br />
          Getting more complicated, though, you may be given a <b>pair</b> of
          equations. This is called a "system of equations", and CAN be solved.
          Let's look at how we do this! Consider the following system of
          equations:<br /><br />
          <code>y = 3x | y - 6 = x</code>
          A system of equations IS solvable, but it is a multi-step process. To
          get started, we need to choose a variable we are solving for. Let's
          solve for "x" first. From the second equation, we know that "x" equals
          "y - 6", but we cannot simplify that further because we do not have a
          value for "y". Except, thanks to the system of equations, we DO have a
          value for "y". We know that "y" equals "3x". So, looking at our second
          equation, we can replace "y" with "3x" because they have the same
          value. We then get:<br /><br />
          <code>3x - 6 = x</code><br /><br />
          Now we can solve for "x"! We start by adding 6 to each side.<br /><br />
          <code>3x = x + 6</code><br /><br />
          We still need to get "x" by itself, so we subtract "x" from both sides
          and get:<br /><br />
          <code>2x = 6</code><br /><br />
          If this confuses you, remember that "3x" is the same as "x+x+x".
          Subtract an "x" from that and you get "x+x", or "2x". Now we divide
          both sides by 2 and have our value for x!<br /><br />
          <code>x = 3</code><br /><br />
          However, our work is not done yet. We still need to find the value for
          "y". Let's go back to our first equation:<br /><br />
          <code>y = 3x</code><br /><br />
          We have a value for "x" now, so let's see what happens if we put that
          value in.<br /><br />
          <code>y = 3*3</code><br /><br />
          We perform the multiplication and discover that "y=9"! Our solution to
          this system of equations then is:<br /><br />
          <code>x = 3 and y = 9</code><br /><br />
