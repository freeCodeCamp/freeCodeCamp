# --description--

Each Pinyin syllable is spoken with a specific tone, and these tones are just as important as the initials and finals in determining its pronunciation.

A change in tone can completely alter the meaning of a syllable, even when the initials and finals remain exactly the same.

<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/english/animation-assets/images/pinyin-tones.png" alt="Chart showing the four main Mandarin Chinese tones with pitch contours." />

There are four main tones, plus a neutral tone, in Mandarin Chinese. Let's practice pronouncing `a` with different tones.

**Note:** In this curriculum, when you use the Pinyin Tone input and the Pinyin-to-Hanzi input, the number following a Pinyin should follow this convention:

- 1 indicates the first tone, the mark of which is `ˉ`.

- 2 indicates the second tone, the mark of which is `ˊ`.

- 3 indicates the third tone, the mark of which is `ˇ`.

- 4 indicates the fourth tone, the mark of which is `ˋ`.

- 5 indicates the neutral tone, which has no tone mark.

# --transcript--

The first tone is a high and level tone that stays steadily high without rising or falling.

The second tone is a rising tone that starts in the middle and moves upward to a high point.

The third tone is a low dipping tone that starts in the middle, falls to a low point and then rises again.

The fourth tone is a sharp falling​ tone that starts high​ and drops quickly​ to the bottom.

There is also a neutral tone, which is short and soft. It is not marked with any tone mark.

I've watched the video and practiced pronouncing this final.
