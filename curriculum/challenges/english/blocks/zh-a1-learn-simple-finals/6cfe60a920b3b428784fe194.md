<!-- (Audio) Chen Na: a -->

# --description--

The first simple final you'll learn is `a`.

To pronounce it, open your mouth wide naturally, keep your jaw relaxed. Your tongue should lie flat and low in your mouth. Make sure the sound is steady and clear. Do not round your lips or spread them too much.

Let's practice pronouncing `a`.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing this final.
