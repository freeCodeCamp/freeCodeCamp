# --description--

In prior lectures, you learned about the `map()` method which creates a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array.

Here is an example:

```js
const developers = [
  { name: "Alice", city: "New York", title: "Frontend Developer" },
  { name: "Bob", city: "San Francisco", title: "Backend Developer" }
];

console.log(developers.map(dev => dev.name));
// ["Alice", "Bob"]
```

`dev` in this example represents each object in the `developers` array. Then, dot notation is used to get the `name` from the object. Lastly, the result will be a new array of names. 

Inside the `getBookInformation` function, use the `map()` method on the `catalog` parameter to return a new array of just book titles. Refer to the example if you need help.

# --hints--

Your `getBookInformation` function should return an array.

```js
assert.isArray(getBookInformation(library));
```

Your `getBookInformation` function should return an array of strings which represents the book titles.

```js
const testLibrary = [
  {
    title: "Title A",
    author: "Author A",
    about: "About A",
    pages: 320,
  },
  {
    title: "Title B",
    author: "Author B",
    about: "About B",
    pages: 320,
  },
  {
    title: "Title C",
    author: "Author C",
    about: "About C",
    pages: 304,
  },
];

const expected = ["Title A", "Title B", "Title C"];

assert.deepEqual(getBookInformation(testLibrary), expected);
```
