# --description--

Now, it is time to test out your function.

Add a `console.log()` below your `getBooksByAuthor()` function.

Inside the `console.log()`, call the `getBooksByAuthor()` function with `library` and `"Arvid Kahl"` for arguments.

Now, you should see all of the books for that particular author in the console.

# --hints--

You should have a `console.log(getBooksByAuthor(library, "Arvid Kahl"))`.

```js
assert.match(code, /console\.log\(\s*getBooksByAuthor\s*\(\s*library\s*,\s*(['"])\s*Arvid\s+Kahl\s*\1\s*\)\s*\)/);
```
