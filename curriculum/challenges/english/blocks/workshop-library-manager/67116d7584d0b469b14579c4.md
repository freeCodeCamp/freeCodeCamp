# --description--

For the last step of the workshop, you will review how to work with the `reduce()` method. This method is used to process an array and condense it into a single value. 

Here is an example:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);

console.log(sum); // 15
```

In the following example, the reducer function takes `acc` (which starts at 0, as specified by the second argument to `reduce`) and adds each number to it. This will return a sum of `15`.

Create a `getTotalPages` function with a single parameter, accepting an array with book objects. The function should return the total number of pages in the books from the array passed to the function.

Lastly, add a `console.log(getTotalPages(library))` below your `getTotalPages` function to see the result.

With that, your library manager workshop is complete!

# --hints--

You should create a `getTotalPages` function.

```js
assert.isFunction(getTotalPages);
```

Your `getTotalPages` function should have one parameter.

```js
assert.lengthOf(getTotalPages, 1);
```

Your `getTotalPages` function should return a number.

```js
assert.isNumber(getTotalPages(library));
```

Your `getTotalPages` function should return the total number of pages in the books from the array passed to it.

```js
assert.strictEqual(getTotalPages(library), 2512);

const _differentLibrary = [
  {
    title: 'Title A',
    author: 'Author A',
    about: 'About A',
    pages: 320,
  },
  {
    title: 'Title B',
    author: 'Author B',
    about: 'About B',
    pages: 320,
  },
  {
    title: 'Title C',
    author: 'Author C',
    about: 'About C',
    pages: 304,
  },
]
assert.strictEqual(getTotalPages(_differentLibrary), 944);
```

You should have a `console.log(getTotalPages(library))`.

```js
assert.match(code, /console\.log\(\s*getTotalPages\(\s*library\)\s*\);?/);
```
