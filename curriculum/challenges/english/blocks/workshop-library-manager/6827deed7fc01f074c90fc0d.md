# --description--

It would be nice to test our your `getBooksByAuthor` function with another author.

Begin by logging the message `"\nList of books by James Clear:\n"` to the console. 

Below that `console.log()`, add another `console.log()`.  Inside that `console.log()`, call the `getBooksByAuthor()` function with `library` and `"James Clear"` for arguments.

Now, you should see all of the books for that particular author in the console.

# --hints--

You should log the message `"\nList of books by James Clear:\n"` to the console.

```js
assert.match(code, /console\.log\(("|')\\nList\s+of\s+books\s+by\s+James\s+Clear:\\n\1\);?/);
```

You should have a `console.log(getBooksByAuthor(library, "James Clear"))`.

```js
assert.match(code, /console\.log\(\s*getBooksByAuthor\s*\(\s*library\s*,\s*(['"])\s*James\s+Clear\s*\1\s*\)\s*\)/);
```
