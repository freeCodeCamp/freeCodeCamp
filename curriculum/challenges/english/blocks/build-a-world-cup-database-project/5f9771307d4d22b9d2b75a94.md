# --description--

This is one of the required projects to earn your certification. For this project, you will create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.

# --instructions--

**Important:** After you pass all the project tests, save a dump of your database into a `worldcup.sql` file, as well as your `insert_data.sh` and `queries.sh` files, so you can complete step 2. There will be instructions how to do that within the virtual machine.

# --notes--

Required files: `worldcup.sql`, `insert_data.sh`, `queries.sh`
