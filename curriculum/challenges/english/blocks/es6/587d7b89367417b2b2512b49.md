# --description--

Destructuring allows you to assign a new variable name when extracting values. You can do this by putting the new name after a colon when assigning the value.

Using the same object from the last example:

```js
const user = { name: 'John Doe', age: 34 };
```

Here's how you can give new variable names in the assignment:

```js
const { name: userName, age: userAge } = user;
```

You may read it as "get the value of `user.name` and assign it to a new variable named `userName`" and so on. The value of `userName` would be the string `John Doe`, and the value of `userAge` would be the number `34`.

# --instructions--

Replace the two assignments with an equivalent destructuring assignment. It should still assign the variables `highToday` and `highTomorrow` the values of `today` and `tomorrow` from the `HIGH_TEMPERATURES` object.

# --hints--

You should remove the ES5 assignment syntax.

```js
assert(
  !__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/highToday = HIGH_TEMPERATURES\.today/g) &&
    !__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/highTomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES\.tomorrow/g)
);
```

You should use destructuring to create the `highToday` variable.

```js
assert(
  __helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(
    /(var|const|let)\s*{\s*(today\s*:\s*highToday[^}]*|[^,]*,\s*today\s*:\s*highToday\s*)}\s*=\s*HIGH_TEMPERATURES(;|\s+|\/\/)/g
  )
);
```

You should use destructuring to create the `highTomorrow` variable.

```js
assert(
  __helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(
    /(var|const|let)\s*{\s*(tomorrow\s*:\s*highTomorrow[^}]*|[^,]*,\s*tomorrow\s*:\s*highTomorrow\s*)}\s*=\s*HIGH_TEMPERATURES(;|\s+|\/\/)/g
  )
);
```

`highToday` should be equal to `77` and `highTomorrow` should be equal to `80`.

```js
assert(highToday === 77 && highTomorrow === 80);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

// Only change code below this line
  
const highToday = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.today;
const highTomorrow = HIGH_TEMPERATURES.tomorrow; 

// Only change code above this line
```

# --solutions--

```js
const HIGH_TEMPERATURES = {
  yesterday: 75,
  today: 77,
  tomorrow: 80
};

const { today: highToday, tomorrow: highTomorrow } = HIGH_TEMPERATURES;
```
