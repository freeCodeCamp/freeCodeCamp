# --description--

A path is a string of parameters, or values, that specifies the location of a file or directory in a file system. In web development, paths let developers link to resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other web pages. There are absolute and relative paths - both are essential when specifying file locations within a file system. Let's look at the two so you can decide which one of them to use and when.

An absolute path is a complete link to a resource; this link contains all of the specific parameters needed to get to the resource. This string gives you the exact step-by-step directions to find the resource, similar to how a recipe for a meal would give you the exact steps you need to take to make the specific meal. The absolute path string starts from the root directory, includes every other directory, and finally the filename and extension. The "root directory" refers to the top-level directory or folder in a hierarchy.

An absolute URL is an example of an absolute path. The absolute URL includes the protocol, which could be `http`, `https`, and `file`, the domain name if the resource is on the web, and the specific resource's filename itself. Here's an example of an absolute URL that links to the freeCodeCamp logo:

```html
<a href="https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/img/fcc_secondary_small.svg">
  View fCC Logo
</a>
```

In this example, the protocol is `https`, the domain name is `design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org`, and the filename is `fcc_secondary_small.svg`.

Now, what if the resource you want to link to is using an absolute path on your local machine instead of the web? Here's how to link to the `about.html` file with the absolute path:

```html
<p>
  Read more on the
  <a
    href="/Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html"
    >About Page</a
    >
</p>
```

The absolute path looks like this because we are going into a folder called `Users`, then into a folder called `user`, then into a folder called `Desktop`, then into a folder called `fCC`, then into a folder called `script-code`, then into a folder called `absolute-vs-relative-paths`, then into a folder called `pages` to finally get the `about.html` file.

We can then make this absolute path into an absolute URL; this is how it would look like in the browser address bar:

```sh
file:///Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/about.html
```

The absolute URL includes the protocol, `file://`. It also includes the path, which looks like this: `/Users/user/Desktop/fCC/script-code/absolute-vs-relative-paths/pages/`, and represents the series of folders that lead to the file. And finally, this absolute URL includes the `about.html`, which is the filename and the extension.

Now, let's look at the relative path. A relative path specifies the location of a file relative to the directory of the current file. The relative path does not give you the exact step-by-step directions to get to the resource. You can think of it like someone is asking you to get the recipe book from the kitchen, as the exact location of the recipe book in the kitchen is not known, since it could be potentially located anywhere in the kitchen, like a cabinent, drawer, island, and so on; but, we know the book is somewhere in the kitchen. Returning to the structure of a relative path, it does not include the protocol or the domain name, making it shorter and more flexible for internal links within the same website. Here's an example of linking to the `about.html` page from the `contact.html` page, both of which are in the same folder:

```html
<p>
  Read more on the
  <a href="about.html">About Page</a>
</p>
```

So imagine you are on the `contact.html` page, and because the `about.html` page is in the same place, you simply get the filename. This is an example of using a relative file path.

So, when should you use an absolute path or a relative path? Here are the rules you can refer to when making this decision:

- Use absolute paths when linking to a resource hosted on an external website.

- Use absolute paths when you need the link to a page or resource to work consistently regardless of the document location within the site.

- Use relative paths when linking to resources within the same website.

- Use relative paths if you want to keep your code cleaner and easier to maintain during development.

- Use relative paths during local testing to ensure links work without an internet connection.
