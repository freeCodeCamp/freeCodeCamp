# --description--

In the prior lesson, you learned how to work with union types. One common way to work with union types is to use a type alias. 

A type alias is a name for a type. Here is an example of providing a name for a union type:

```ts
type ID = number | string;
```

Often times in your projects, you will create type aliases and use them throughout your program like this:

```ts
type ID = number | string;

type User = {
  id: ID;
  name: string;
};

function getUserId(user: User): ID {
  return user.id;
}
```

This example uses two types named `ID` and `User`. `ID` would be a union type for `number` or `string` while `User` is an object type with `id` and `name` properties. The `id` is specified with the `ID` type while the `name` has a the `string` type. 

The `getUserId` function has one parameter called `user` and its type is `User`. The return type for the `getUserId` function would be `ID`. 

Type aliases are a great way to describe the shape of an object. It is common to create object types and use them in arrays like this:

```ts
type User = {
  id: number | string;
  name: string;
};

const users: User[] = [
  { id: 101, name: "Alice" },
  { id: "A102", name: "Bob" },
  { id: 103, name: "Charlie" }
];
```

In this example, the `users` array must be filled with only `User` objects. If you forget a property in one of the objects, then TypeScript will throw an error like this:

```ts
type User = {
  id: number | string;
  name: string;
};

const users: User[] = [
  // Property 'name' is missing in type '{ id: number; }' but required in type 'User'.
  { id: 101 },
  { id: "A102", name: "Bob" },
  { id: 103, name: "Charlie" }
];
```

You might have noticed the use of PascalCase when it came to naming the type aliases. This is because by convention using PascalCase helps distinguish types from variables. It also helps with readability. When you see `User[]`, you will know it's an array of objects of type `User`.
