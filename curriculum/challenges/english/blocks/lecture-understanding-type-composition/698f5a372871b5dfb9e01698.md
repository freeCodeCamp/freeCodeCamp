# --description--

In the prior lessons, you learned how to work with primitive types like `string`, and `boolean`. But TypeScript allows you to build new types from existing ones. One example of this would be the union type.

A union type is a type that combines two or more other types.

Here is the basic syntax:

```ts
type1 | type2 | type3
```

Let's take a look at some examples to better understand the concept. 

Here is a variable called `id` with a union type for `string` or `number`:

```ts
let id: string | number = "user_783";
```

The value can be updated to a number which is still valid for the union type:

```ts
let id: string | number = 1024;
```

If you tried to assign another value that isn't a `string` or `number`, then TypeScript will display an error message:

```ts
// Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
let id: string | number = ["Java", "Python"];
```

When working with union types, it is important to use methods that work for all of the types, otherwise TypeScript will throw an error like this:

```ts
function getId(id: string | number) {
  // Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  //   Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.
  return id.toUpperCase();
}
```

There is a solution for this which involves narrowing the union. But you will learn more about that as well as how union types work with type aliases in future lessons.

Union types are also helpful when working with `null` and `undefined` values. 

Here is an example where a variable might contain a `string` value, or it might be `null` if no value has been set yet:

```ts
let username: string | null;

// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string | null'.
username = 42;
```

In this case, `username` can either be a `string` or `null`, but nothing else. You might use `null` when you want to intentionally represent the absence of a value.

Here is another example using `undefined`:

```ts
let score: number | undefined;

score = undefined; 

// Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number | undefined'.
score = "high";
```

In this example, `score` can either be a `number` or `undefined`. You might use `undefined` when a value has not been assigned yet.

Using union types with `null` and `undefined` makes it clear when a value might be missing, while still allowing TypeScript to catch invalid assignments.
