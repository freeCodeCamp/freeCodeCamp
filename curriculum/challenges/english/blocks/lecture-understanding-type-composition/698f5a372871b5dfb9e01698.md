# --description--

In the prior lessons, you learned how to work with primitive types like `string`, and `boolean`. But TypeScript allows you to build new types from existing ones. One example of this would be the union type.

A union type is a type that combines two or more other types.

Here is the basic syntax:

```ts
type1 | type2 | type3
```

Let's take a look at some examples to better understand the concept. 

Here is a variable called `id` with a union type for `string` or `number`:

```ts
let id: string | number = "user_783";
```

The value can be updated to a number which is still valid for the union type:

```ts
let id: string | number = 1024;
```

If you tried to assign another value that isn't a `string` or `number`, then TypeScript will display an error message:

```ts
// Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string | number'.
let id: string | number = ["Java", "Python"];
```

When working with union types, it important to use methods that work for all of the types, otherwise TypeScript will throw an error like this:

```ts
function getId(id: string | number) {
  // Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  //   Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.
  return id.toUpperCase();
}
```

There is a solution for this which involves narrowing the union. But you will learn more about that as well as how union types work with type aliases in future lessons.
