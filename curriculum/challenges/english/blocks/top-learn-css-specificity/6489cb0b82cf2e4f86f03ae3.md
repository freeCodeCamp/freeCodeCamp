# --description--

Letâ€™s take a look at a few quick examples to visualize how specificity works. Consider the following HTML and CSS code:

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<div class="main">
  <div class="list subsection"></div>
</div>
```

```css
/* rule 1 */
.subsection {
  color: blue;
}

/* rule 2 */
.main .list {
  color: red;
}
```

In the example above, both rules are using only class selectors, but rule 2 is more specific because it is using more class selectors.
