What could Brian say to show he agrees with Jake's suggestion?

## --answers--

`That makes sense.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`To make sense` means something is logical, reasonable, or easy to understand. When someone says `That makes sense`, they are saying they agree or understand the reason behind it. For example:

- Person 1: `We should save our work regularly to avoid losing progress.` - This person offers a solution to keep the progress of work without losing it.

- Person 2: `That makes sense.` â€“ This shows the second person agrees with the idea.
