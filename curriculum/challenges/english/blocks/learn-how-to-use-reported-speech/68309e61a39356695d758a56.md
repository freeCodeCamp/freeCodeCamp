# --explanation--

`To notice` means to become aware of something through seeing, hearing, or sensing it — especially when something has changed or stands out. For example:

`Did you notice the new button on the homepage?` – This is the same as to ask if someone saw the change.

Tom's question, `Were the changes noticed?`, is in the **passive voice**. It focuses on the changes (the object), not the person who noticed them (the subject). Another example of the **passive voice** in a question:

`Was the mistake corrected before the launch?` – This focuses on the correction, not on who corrected it.
