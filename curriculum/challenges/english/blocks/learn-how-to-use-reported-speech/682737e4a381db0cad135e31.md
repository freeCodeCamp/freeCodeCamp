# --explanation--

This is an example of **reported speech**, which is when someone repeats what another person said, but not using their exact words. You usually shift the verb to the past. For example:  

- Jake (to Sophie): `The team responded quickly once the breach was detected.`

- Sophie (to Brian, mentioning what Jake said): `He said that the team responded quickly once the breach was detected.`

In the cases when you want to report exactly what the other person said, it is common to only add the speaker's name (or a pronoun) in the beginning, the verb `say` in the Simple Past (as you are reporting something that was talked about previously), and the word `that`, followed by the information. This is common in spoken and written English to share information from someone else.
