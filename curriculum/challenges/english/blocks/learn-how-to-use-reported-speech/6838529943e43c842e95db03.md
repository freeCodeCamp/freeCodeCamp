# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense (`have/has been` + verb in the `-ing` form) is used to describe an action that started in the past and is still continuing or has recently stopped. It often focuses on the activity or process. For example:

`I have been studying the logs all morning.` â€“ This means the action started earlier and may still be happening now.
