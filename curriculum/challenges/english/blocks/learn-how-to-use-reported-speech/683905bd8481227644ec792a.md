# --explanation--

`One` can be used to avoid repeating a noun that was just mentioned. For example:

`She has a red car and I have a blue one.` â€“ This means she has a red car and you have a blue car (without repeating `car`).

Here, instead of saying `a tough lesson` and then repeating `lesson`, Lisa says `a tough lesson` and then `a valuable one`.
