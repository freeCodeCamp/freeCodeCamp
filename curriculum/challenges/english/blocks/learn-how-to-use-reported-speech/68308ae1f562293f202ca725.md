# --explanation--

When you say `It could be toned down a bit`, you're using a **passive voice** construction with a **modal verb**. It focuses on the action and what should happen, not who should do it.

The **active voice** version would be `The designers could tone down the color scheme a bit`. This clearly names who should take action. Another example:

- **Passive voice**: `The notification sound could be lowered.` – This focuses on the sound, not the person making the change.

- **Active voice**: `You could lower the notification sound.` – This tells who is responsible for the action.
