# --explanation--

In **reported speech**, the phrase `said that` is used to share what someone said in a different way, not using their exact words. The word `that` is optional and often left out in everyday speech. For example:

- Direct speech: `We need to update the software.`

- Reported speech: `He said that we need to update the software.` or `He said we need to update the software.`

Both versions are correct and mean the same thing.
