# --explanation--

`Role clarity` means everyone knows exactly what their duties are. For example:

`Improving role clarity helped the team work more efficiently during the launch.` – This means knowing their responsibilities helped the team.

An `incident response plan` is a set of steps a team follows when something goes wrong, like a security issue. For example:

`The company updated its incident response plan after the phishing attack.` – This means they improved their plan for handling future problems.
