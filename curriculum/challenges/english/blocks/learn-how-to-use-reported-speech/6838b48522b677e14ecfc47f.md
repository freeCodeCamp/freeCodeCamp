# --explanation--

The `Past Continuous` tense (`was/were` + verb in the `-ing` form) describes an action that was happening over a period of time in the past. It is often used together with a `Simple Past` event to show that the continuous action was interrupted or happened before another event. For example:

`She was working on the report when the computer crashed.` â€“ The action of working was ongoing when the crash (`Simple Past`) happened.
