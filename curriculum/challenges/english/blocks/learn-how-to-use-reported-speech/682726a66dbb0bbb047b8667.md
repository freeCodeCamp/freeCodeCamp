# --explanation--

`To speak with someone about something` means to have a conversation or discussion with a person on a specific topic. For example:

`She spoke with her manager about taking some days off.` – This means she had a conversation with her manager about vacation time.

The past form of `speak` is `spoke`. In this case, Sophie is talking about something that already happened – her conversation with Jake.
