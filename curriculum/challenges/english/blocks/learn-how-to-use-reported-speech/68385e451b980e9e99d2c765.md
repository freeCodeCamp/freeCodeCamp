# --explanation--

`True` is an adjective that means something is correct, real, or accurate. It is used to agree with a statement or fact. It is different from `the truth`, which is a noun that refers to the actual facts or reality about something, often used in a broader or more abstract sense. For example:

- `It's true that the server crashed yesterday.` – This means the statement about the crash is correct.

- `The truth is that we didn't have a backup.` – This means the actual fact is no backup existed.
