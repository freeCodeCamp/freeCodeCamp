# --explanation--

`Which` can be used to introduce extra information about the previous clause. This is called a **non-defining relative clause** — it adds detail but is not essential to the sentence's meaning. For example:

`The system crashed during the update, which caused a delay.` – The part after `which` gives more information about the result of the crash, but it could be left out without changing the main point.
