# --explanation--

`Damage` refers to harm or negative effects caused to something. For example:

`The storm caused serious damage to the roof.` â€“ This means the storm harmed the roof.

`To mention` is another verb used in **reported speech**, like `say` or `tell`. It means to refer to something in conversation.

In reported speech, pronouns often change. For example, in direct speech, Jake might have said: `We managed to isolate the affected systems within minutes`. When Sophie reports it, however, `we` changes to `they` as she was not a part of the effort: `Jake mentioned that they managed to isolate the affected systems`. Another example:

- Direct speech: `We completed the project on time.`

- Reported speech: `She mentioned that they had completed the project on time.`
