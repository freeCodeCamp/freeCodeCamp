Sophie writes the summary Brian requested:

`Security Breach Summary`

`Last week, a phishing attack targeted several team members. I spoke with Jake, our cybersecurity specialist, about what happened.`

`The team responded quickly after the breach was detected, isolating the affected systems in minutes, and limiting the damage.`

`Jake mentioned, however, that there was some confusion about team roles during the incident. He recommended clearer roles in our incident response plan.`

`Ideas to prevent future attacks:`

- `Updating security training to cover more on phishing detection`

- `Doing security audits more often`

- `Keeping software updated, since the attack used an outdated system component`
