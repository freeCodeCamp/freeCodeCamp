# --explanation--

`Several` means more than a few, but not all. For example:

`Several users reported issues with the new software.` – This means more than two users had problems, but not everyone.

`To target` means to aim at or direct something toward someone or something. For example:

`The hackers targeted customers by sending fake emails.` – This means they tried to trick the customers specifically.
