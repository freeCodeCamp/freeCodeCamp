The team prepares the list of modifications suggested by Tom:

**`Planned Website Modifications Based on User Feedback`**

**`1. Adjust the Color Scheme`**

`Some users said the current colors are too strong. We will use softer and lighter colors to make the website easier to look at.`

**`2. Optimize Image Sizes`**

`A few images are too large and make the pages load slowly. We will reduce their size so the website works faster.`

**`3. Keep the New Navigation Menu`**

`Users like the new menu. It's easier to use, so we will keep it as it is.`

**`4. Keep the Simplified Layout`**

`The simpler layout helps people find information faster. We will keep this new layout.`

**`5. Keep the Updated Contact Page`**

`The contact form is user-friendly and the extra contact options are helpful. We will not make changes here.`
