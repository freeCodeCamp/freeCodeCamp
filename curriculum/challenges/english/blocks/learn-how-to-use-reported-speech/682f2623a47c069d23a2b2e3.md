# --explanation--

`To exploit` means to take advantage of a flaw, weakness, or situation — often in a harmful or unfair way. For example:

`Hackers exploited a bug in the software to access private data.` – This means they used the weakness to do damage.

`Outdated` describes something old or no longer useful because something better or more current exists. For example:

`The company replaced its outdated firewall to improve security.` – This means the old firewall was no longer effective or safe.
