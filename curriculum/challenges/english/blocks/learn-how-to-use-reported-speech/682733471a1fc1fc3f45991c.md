# --explanation--

Questions in the `Simple Past` tense use `did` + subject + base verb. For example:

`What did Sophie say?` – `Did` shows it's in the past, and `say` is the base verb.

In contrast, the affirmative form uses the past form of the verb directly. For example:

`Sophie said that the movie was great.` – The past form of `say` is `said`.
