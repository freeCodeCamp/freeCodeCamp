## --blanks--

`isolate`

### --feedback--

This means to separate something from the rest so it doesn't spread or affect other parts.

---

`within`

### --feedback--

This shows a limit of time or distance, meaning something happens before the end of that time.

# --explanation--

`To isolate` in this context means to separate the affected systems from the rest of the network to stop the damage from spreading. For example:

`They isolated the infected device to prevent the virus from spreading.` – This means they separated the device to protect others.

`Within` means in less than a certain time or before the end of a specific time or limit. For example:

`She replied within two hours.` – This means she replied in less than two hours.
