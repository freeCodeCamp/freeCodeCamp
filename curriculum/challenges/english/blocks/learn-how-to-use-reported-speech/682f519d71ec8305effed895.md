Sophie writes the summary Brian requested:

`Security Breach Summary`

`Last week, a phishing attack targeted several team members. I spoke with Jake, our cybersecurity specialist, about what happened.`

`The team responded quickly after the breach was detected, isolating the affected systems in minutes, and limiting the damage.`

`Jake mentioned, however, that there was some confusion about team roles during the incident. He recommended clearer roles in our incident response plan.`

`Ideas to prevent future attacks:`

- `Updating security training to cover more on phishing detection`

- `Doing security audits more often`

- `Keeping software updated, since the attack used an outdated system component`

Why did they conclude that the software should always be updated, according to the summary?

## --answers--

Because updates are required by company rules.

### --feedback--

The summary does not mention company rules as the reason.

---

Because updates make the software faster.

### --feedback--

Speed is not the reason given for updating the software.

---

Because older software is harder to use.

### --feedback--

There was no mention of usability issues with old software.

---

Because the breach used a weakness in an outdated system.
