# --explanation--

`To give feedback` means to share opinions, advice, or information about something, usually to help improve it. For example:

`She gave feedback on the presentation to help the speaker improve.` - She shared her opinion on how to make the presentation better.

`Similar` means alike or nearly the same. It shows that two or more things share common features. For example:

`We had a similar issue last month with the login system.` â€“ This means the issue was like the one happening now.
