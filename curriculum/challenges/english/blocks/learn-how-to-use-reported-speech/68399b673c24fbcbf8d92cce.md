Imagine someone wrote the minutes for the meeting between Lisa and Mark. These were the notes taken.

`Lisa and Mark discussed the recent database crash that happened last week. Lisa mentioned that after reviewing the logs, she realized the system overload might have been prevented if they had monitored the system load more closely. Mark agreed and added that the logs showed an unusually high number of queries hitting the database just before the crash. He suggested that if these queries had been spread more evenly, the system might not have failed.`

`Lisa also pointed out that they hadn't updated their database management software for some time. She believed that if the latest patches had been installed, some of the vulnerabilities exploited during the crash could have been fixed. Mark shared the same thought and expressed frustration that they had not prioritized the update earlier, which might have prevented the problem.`

`Finally, Lisa noted that although the situation was difficult, it was an important lesson. She asked how they could avoid such issues in the future, emphasizing the need for a more proactive maintenance strategy.`

Apart from the excess of queries at the same time, what else did Lisa point out as a possible cause for the crash?

## --answers--

The database management software was not updated with the latest patches.

---

The system was overloaded due to faulty hardware.

### --feedback--

Lisa did not mention any hardware problems.

---

The queries were spread too evenly across the system.

### --feedback--

Lisa didn't say anything about the queries. Mark did.

---

The logs were deleted before they could be reviewed.

### --feedback--

Lisa reviewed the logs, so they couldn't have been deleted.

# --explanation--

The second paragraph begins with Lisa pointing something out. The `Past Perfect` structure is used, indicating that something happened (or, in this case, did not happen) before the system crash. This could have fixed some vulnerabilities. Find the line where the Past Perfect is used to find the correct answer to this question.
