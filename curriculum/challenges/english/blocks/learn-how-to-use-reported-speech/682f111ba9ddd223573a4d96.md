# --explanation--

`While` can be used to contrast two ideas. It works like `even though` or `although` to show that both things happened at the same time. For example:

`While the design looked good, the app didn't work properly.` â€“ This means the design was nice, but there was a problem with how the app functioned.

In this case, there were a positive (the team's quick response) and a negative (confusion about responsibilities) aspects about the incident. `While` is used to contrast both.
