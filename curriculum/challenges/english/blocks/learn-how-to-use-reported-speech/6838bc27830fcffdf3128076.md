<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --questions--

## --text--

## --answers--

`Exactly.`

---

`I'm not sure about that.`

### --feedback--

This shows doubt, not agreement.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Exactly` is an adverb used to show full agreement or correctness with what someone else has said. `Exact`, on the other hand, is an adjective meaning precise or correct in detail. For example:

- `You are exactly right about the cause of the problem.` – This shows full agreement. It expresses how right (adjective) the person was.

- `We need the exact measurements to build the new server rack.` – This means very precise measurements. It qualifies a noun instead of a verb or adjective.
