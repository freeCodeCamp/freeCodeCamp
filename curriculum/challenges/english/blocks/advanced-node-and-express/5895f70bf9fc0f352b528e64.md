# --description--

One of the greatest features of using a template engine is being able to pass variables from the server to the template file before rendering it to HTML.

In your Pug file, you're able to use a variable by referencing the variable name as `#{variable_name}` inline with other text on an element or by using an equal sign on the element without a space such as `p=variable_name` which assigns the variable's value to the p element's text.

Pug is all about using whitespace and tabs to show nested elements and cutting down on the amount of code needed to make a beautiful site.

Take the following Pug code for example: 
 
```pug
head
  script(type='text/javascript').
    if (foo) bar(1 + 5);
body
  if youAreUsingPug
      p You are amazing
    else
      p Get on it!
```

The above yields the following HTML:

```html
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    if (foo) bar(1 + 5);
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <p>You are amazing</p>
</body>
```

Your `index.pug` file included in your project, uses the variables `title` and `message`.

Pass those from your server to the Pug file by adding an object as a second argument to your `res.render` call with the variables and their values. Give the `title` a value of `Hello` and `message` a value of `Please log in`.

It should look like:

```javascript
res.render('index', { title: 'Hello', message: 'Please log in' });
```

Now refresh your page, and you should see those values rendered in your view in the correct spot as laid out in your `index.pug` file!

Submit your page when you think you've got it right.

# --hints--

Pug should correctly render variables.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  assert.match(
    data,
    /pug-variable("|')>Please log in/gi,
    'Your projects home page should now be rendered by pug with the projects .pug file unaltered'
  );
}
```
