## Introduction to CSS Flexbox and Flex Model

- **Definition**: CSS flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model that allows you to arrange elements in rows and columns within a container. 
- **Flex Model**: This model defines how flex items are arranged within a flex container. Every flex container has two axes: the main axis and the cross axis.

## The `flex-direction` Property

- **Definition**: This property sets the direction of the main axis. The default value of `flex-direction` is `row`, which places all the flex items on the same row, in the direction of your browser's default language (left to right or right to left). 
- **`flex-direction: row-reverse;`**: This reverses the items in the row.
- **`flex-direction: column;`**: This will align the flex items vertically instead of horizontally.
- **`flex-direction: column-reverse;`**: This reverses the order of the flex items vertically.

## The `flex-wrap` Property

- **Definition**: This property determines how flex items are wrapped within a flex container to fit the available space. `flex-wrap` can take three possible values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`.
- **`flex-wrap: nowrap;`**: This is the default value. Flex items won't be wrapped onto a new line, even if their width exceed the container's width.
- **`flex-wrap: wrap;`**: This property will wrap the items when they exceed the width of their container.
- **`flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;`**: This property will wrap flex items in reverse order.
- **`flex-flow` Property**: This property is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.

```css
flex-flow: column wrap-reverse;
```

## The `justify-content` Property

- **Definition**: This property aligns the child elements along the main axis of the flex container.
- **`justify-content: flex-start;`**: In this case, the flex items will be aligned to the start of the main axis. This could be horizontal or vertical.
- **`justify-content: flex-end;`**: In this case, the flex items are aligned to the end of the main axis, horizontally or vertically.
- **`justify-content: center;`**: This centers the flex items along the main axis.
- **`justify-content: space-between;`**: This will distribute the elements evenly along the main axis.
- **`justify-content: space-around;`**: This will distribute flex items evenly within the main axis, adding a space before the first item and after the last item.
- **`justify-content: space-evenly;`**: This will distribute the items evenly along the main axis.
  
## The `align-items` Property

- **Definition**: This property is used to distribute items along the cross axis. Remember that the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis.
- **`align-items: center;`**: This is used to center the items along the cross axis.
- **`align-items: flex-start;`**: This aligns the items to the start of the cross axis.
- **`align-items: stretch;`**: This is used to stretch the flex items along the cross axis.

## The `align-content` Property

- **Definition**: This property aligns flex lines when there are multiple lines of flex items. It only has an effect when `flex-wrap: wrap` is used and there are multiple lines.
- **`align-content: flex-start;`**: Packs lines to the start of the cross axis.
- **`align-content: flex-end;`**: Packs lines to the end of the cross axis.
- **`align-content: center;`**: Centers the lines in the cross axis.
- **`align-content: space-between;`**: Distributes lines with equal space between them.
- **`align-content: space-around;`**: Distributes lines with equal space around them.
- **`align-content: stretch;`**: Stretches lines to fill the container (default).

## The `order` Property

- **Definition**: This property controls the order in which flex items appear in the flex container, without changing the HTML structure.
- **Default Value**: All flex items have an `order` of `0` by default.
- **Higher Values**: Items with higher `order` values appear later.
- **Negative Values**: Items with negative `order` values appear earlier.

```css
.first-item { order: 3; }  /* Appears last */
.second-item { order: 1; } /* Appears first */
.third-item { order: 2; }  /* Appears middle */
```

## The `flex-grow` Property

- **Definition**: This property defines how much a flex item should grow relative to other flex items when extra space is available.
- **Default Value**: `0` (the item won't grow)
- **Higher Values**: The item will claim more of the available space proportionally.

```css
.sidebar { flex-grow: 0; }      /* Stays at natural size */
.main-content { flex-grow: 1; } /* Takes available space */
.featured { flex-grow: 2; }     /* Grows twice as much */
```
