<!-- (Audio) Camila: Punto, Arroba, Guión, Guión bajo -->

# --description--

Some symbols have become essential in daily workplace activities. 

These are four of the most commonly used ones in Spanish:

| Symbol | Spanish | Meaning |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `.` | `Punto` | Period / Dot |
| `@` | `Arroba` | At sign |
| `-` | `Guión` | Hyphen / Dash |
| `_` | `Guión bajo` | Underscore |

Note that the word `Guión` carries an accent mark in the letter `o`.

Camila will help you practice these symbols. Repeat their sounds until you feel more comfortable with them and then match each symbol to its name in Spanish.
