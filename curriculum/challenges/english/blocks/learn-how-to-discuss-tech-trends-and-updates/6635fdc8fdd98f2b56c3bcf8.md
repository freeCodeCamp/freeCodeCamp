# --description--

Expressions like `do you know`, `could you tell me`, and `do you have any idea` are commonly used in English to inquire or confirm information gently. You use them followed by a question and the structure of the question changes to an affirmative sentence.

Examples:

Original question `What time is it?` changed to `Do you know what time it is?`

Original question `How long does it take to read this book?` changed to `Could you tell me how long it takes to read this book?`
