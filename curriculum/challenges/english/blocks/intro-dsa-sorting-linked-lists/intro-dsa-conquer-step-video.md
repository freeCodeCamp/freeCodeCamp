# --description--

In this video, you will learn to implement the merge sort algorithm on linked lists by practicing the conquer step.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the purpose of the `merge` function in this merge sort implementation?

## --answers--

The purpose is to split a linked list into smaller sublists for recursive sorting.

---

The purpose is to select nodes from each list without sorting and combine them.

---

The purpose is to merge two linked list, sorting by data in nodes and returning a new merged list.
