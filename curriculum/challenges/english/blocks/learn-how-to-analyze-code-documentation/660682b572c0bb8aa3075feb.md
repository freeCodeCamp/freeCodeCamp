An `endpoint` in an API is a specific location where you can request certain data or service. For example, `The API endpoint for weather data retrieves the latest forecasts.` 

 To `offer` means to provide or make available. For instance, `This service offers real-time updates.`

A `route` is a path defined in the API that determines how requests are handled. Like, `The login route verifies user credentials.`
