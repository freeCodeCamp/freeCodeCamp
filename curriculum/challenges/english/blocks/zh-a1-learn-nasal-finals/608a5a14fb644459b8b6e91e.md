<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: ang, bang, pang, fang, dang, huang, chuang, fāng, fáng, fǎng, fàng -->

# --description--

`ang` is the first back nasal final you learn.

Unlike front nasals which end in `n` with the tongue tip behind the upper teeth, back nasals end with `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.

To pronounce `ang`, start with the open vowel `a`, then let the sound continue into the back nasal `ng`. Keep the mouth open and allow the sound to resonate at the back of the throat. The transition should be smooth without any break.

When `ang` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `bang`, `pang`, `mang`, `fang`, `dang`, and `chang`.

Let's practice pronouncing `ang` and the syllables, and then use `fang` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final and syllables.
