<!-- (Audio) A: wēng -->

# --description--

`ueng` is a special final. It can't be combined with any initial. Instead, `ueng` only appears as a standalone syllable, with the leading `u` replaced with `w`, forming the syllable `weng`.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `e` in `ueng`. For example, `wēng`.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the syllable with the correct tone mark.
