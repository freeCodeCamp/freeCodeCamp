<!-- (Audio) Li Hong: üan, juan, quan, xuan, xuān, xuán, xuǎn, xuàn -->

# --description--

`üan` starts with the final `ü`, which is pronounced by shaping your lips like you're saying `u` (rounded), but placing your tongue as if you're saying `i`.

To pronounce `üan`, begin with `ü`, then open your mouth slightly for a short `a`-like sound, and finish with the nasal `n` by touching your tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

It's important to keep the rounded lip shape at the start. Don't pronounce it like `uan`.

When combined with initials `j`, `q`, and `x`, the two dots above `ü` are omitted, but the pronunciation remains `üan`.

Let's practice pronouncing `üan` and the syllables, and then use `xuan` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `xuān`  | `宣`|
| `xuán`   | `玄`|
| `xuǎn`  | `选`|
| `xuàn`  | `炫`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
