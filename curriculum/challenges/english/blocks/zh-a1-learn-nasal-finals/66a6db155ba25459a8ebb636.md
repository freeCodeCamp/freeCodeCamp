`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`版本 (bǎn běn)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `bǎn` and `běn`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `b` with the final `an`, and uses the third tone, which falls and then rises. The second syllable combines the initial `b` with the final `en`, and also uses the third tone.

`版本 (bǎn běn)` is used to talk about different releases of software, documents, or products, such as an old version and a new version.
