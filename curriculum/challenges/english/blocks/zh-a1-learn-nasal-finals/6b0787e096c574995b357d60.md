<!-- (Audio) speaker: ong, dong, tong, gong, hong, cong, zhong, tōng, tóng, tǒng, tòng -->

# --description--

`ong` is a back nasal final. It begins with a sound close to `u`, with the lips rounded, then moves into the back nasal `ng`, made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.

The transition should be smooth and continuous without any break between the parts.

When `ong` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `dong`, `tong`, `gong`, `kong`, `hong`, `cong`, `zhong`, `shong`, and `rong`.

Let's practice pronouncing `ong` and the syllables, and then use `tong` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `tōng`  | `通`|
| `tóng`   | `同`|
| `tǒng`  | `统`|
| `tòng`  | `痛`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
