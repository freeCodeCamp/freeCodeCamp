# --description--

`en` is a front nasal final. Like `an`, it ends with the nasal `n` sound.

To pronounce `en`, you begin with a tighter mouth shape than `an`, then lightly press the tip of your tongue behind your top teeth to finish with `n`.

This nasal final is short, quick, and forward in the mouth.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `ben`, `pen`, `men`, `fen`, `zhen`, `chen`, `shen`, and `ren`.

Let's practice pronouncing `en` and the syllables, and then use `shen` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `shēn`  | `深`|
| `shén`   | `神`|
| `shěn`  | `审`|
| `shèn`  | `慎`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
