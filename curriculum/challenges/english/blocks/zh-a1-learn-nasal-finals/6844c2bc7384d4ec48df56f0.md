`性能 (xìng néng)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `xìng` and `néng`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `x` with the final `ing`, and uses the fourth tone, which is a falling tone. The second syllable combines the initial `n` with the final `eng`, and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high.

`性能 (xìng néng)` is used to talk about how well something works, especially in terms of speed, stability, or efficiency.
