<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: eng, beng, peng, meng, deng, leng -->

# --description--

`eng` is a back nasal final, like `ang`, but with a different vowel quality.  

While `ang` starts with the open vowel `a`, `eng` begins with a mid vowel sound. The tongue root is pulled slightly further back than in `ang`, and the lips stay more relaxed.  

It ends with the back nasal `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

When `eng` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `beng`, `peng`, `meng`, `deng`, and `sheng`.
