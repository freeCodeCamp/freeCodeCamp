<!-- (Audio) Li Hong: eng, beng, peng, meng, deng, zheng, pēng, péng, pěng, pèng -->

# --description--

`eng` is a back nasal final, like `ang`, but with a different vowel quality.  

While `ang` starts with the open vowel `a`, `eng` begins with a mid vowel sound. The tongue root is pulled slightly further back than in `ang`, and the lips stay more relaxed.  

It ends with the back nasal `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

When `eng` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `beng`, `peng`, `meng`, `deng`, and `sheng`.

Let's practice pronouncing `eng` and the syllables, and then use `peng` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `pēng`  | `烹`|
| `péng`   | `朋`|
| `pěng`  | `捧`|
| `pèng`  | `碰`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
