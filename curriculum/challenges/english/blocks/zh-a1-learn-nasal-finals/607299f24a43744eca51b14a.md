<!-- (Audio) Li Hong: 轮询 (lún xún) -->

# --description--

In this lesson, you'll practice using `uen` and `ün` to form a word.

When you need to check something again and again at regular intervals instead of just once, this word is often used in that situation.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the word below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`轮询 (lún xún)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `lún` and `xún`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `l` with the final `uen` (written as `un`), and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high. The second syllable combines the initial `x` with the final `ün` (written as `xun` in Pinyin), and also uses the second tone.

`轮询 (lún xún)` refers to a method where a system periodically checks for new data or status changes instead of relying on event-driven notifications.
