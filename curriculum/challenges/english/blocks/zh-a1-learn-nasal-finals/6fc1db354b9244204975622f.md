<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: uan, duan, tuan, guan, kuan, shuan, huān, huán, huǎn, huàn -->

# --description--

`uan` is a smooth blend that starts with the rounded vowel `u` and ends with the nasal `n` sound.

Begin by rounding your lips tightly to pronounce `u`, then quickly open your mouth slightly to produce a short vowel like `a`, and finish with the nasal `n` sound by gently touching the tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

Although the spelling is `u-a-n`, the middle `a` is very short and light. It should feel like one connected syllable, not three separate parts.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `duan`, `tuan`, `guan`, `kuan`, and `huan`.

Let's practice pronouncing `uan` and the syllables, and then use `huan` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final and syllables.
