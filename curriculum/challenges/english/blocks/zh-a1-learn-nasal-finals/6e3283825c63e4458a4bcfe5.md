<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: y, ya, ye, yi, yao, you, yang, yu -->

# --description--

Sometimes you see `y` and `w` at the start of a syllable. They are not real consonants. Think of them as special spelling symbols that clarify syllable boundaries and make syllables easier to read.

The rules for `y` are:

- If `i` is used as a syllable, add `y` in front of it: `i` → `yi`.

- If a syllable starts with `i`, change it to `y`. Examples: `ia` → `ya`, `ie` → `ye`, `iao` → `yao`, `iou` → `you`, `iang` → `yang`.

- If `ü` is used as a syllable, add `y` in front of it and remove the dots: `ü` → `yu`.
