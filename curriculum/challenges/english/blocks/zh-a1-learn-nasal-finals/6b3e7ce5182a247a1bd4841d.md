<!-- (Audio) Li Hong: in, bin, pin, min, nin, lin, līn, lín, lǐn, lìn -->

# --description--

The nasal final `in` is a front nasal ending with the `n` sound, like `an` and `en`.

To pronounce `in`, start with the vowel `i`, where the tongue is high and close to the roof of the mouth. Then move into the nasal `n` sound by touching the tongue tip behind your top teeth.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `bin`, `pin`, `min`, `nin`, and `lin`.

Let's practice pronouncing `in` and the syllables, and then use `lin` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `līn`  | `拎`|
| `lín`   | `林`|
| `lǐn`  | `凛`|
| `lìn`  | `吝`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
