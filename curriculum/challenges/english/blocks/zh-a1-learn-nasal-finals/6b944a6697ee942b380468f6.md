<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: uang, guang, kuang, huang, shuang, huāng, huáng, huǎng, huàng -->

# --description--

`uang` combines the rounded vowel `u` with the back nasal final `ang`.  

It starts with `u`, made with rounded lips, then opens into `a`, and finishes with the back nasal `ng`, formed by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

When `uang` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `guang`, `kuang`, `huang`, and `shuang`.

Let's practice pronouncing `uang` and the syllables, and then use `huang` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final and syllables.
