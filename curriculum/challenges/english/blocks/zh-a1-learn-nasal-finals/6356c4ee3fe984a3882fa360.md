<!-- (Audio) speaker: ün, jun, qun, xun, xūn, xún, xùn -->

# --description--

The last front nasal final `ün` is made of `ü` plus the nasal `n`. You start with the rounded `ü` vowel, then move directly into the nasal `n` by touching the tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

Unlike `uen`, there is no middle `e` sound here. It's simply a quick connection from `ü` to `n`.

When `ün` is combined with `j`, `q` and `x`, the two dots on `ü` are omitted.

Let's practice pronouncing `ün` and the syllables, and then use `xun` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `xūn`  | `勋`|
| `xún`   | `寻`|
| `xùn`  | `训`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
