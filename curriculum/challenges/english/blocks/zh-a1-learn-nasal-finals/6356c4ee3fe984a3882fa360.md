<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ün, jun, qun, xun -->

# --description--

The last front nasal final `ün` is made of `ü` plus the nasal `n`. You start with the rounded `ü` vowel, then move directly into the nasal `n` by touching the tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

Unlike `uen`, there is no middle `e` sound here. It's simply a quick connection from `ü` to `n`.

When `ün` is combined with `j`, `q` and `x`, the two dots on `ü` are omitted.
