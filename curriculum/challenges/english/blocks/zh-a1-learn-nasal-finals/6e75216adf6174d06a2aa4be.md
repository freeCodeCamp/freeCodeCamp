<!-- (Audio) speaker: iang, jiang, qiang, xiang, liang, niang, qiāng, qiáng, qiǎng, qiàng -->

# --description--

`iang` combines the high vowel `i` with the back nasal final `ang`.  

It starts with `i`, where the tongue is high and the lips are spread, then quickly opens into `a` before finishing with the back nasal `ng`, made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

When `iang` is combined with initials, you can form syllables like `jiang`, `qiang`, `xiang`, `liang`, and `niang`.

Let's practice pronouncing `iang` and the syllables, and then use `qiang` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `qiāng`  | `枪`|
| `qiáng`   | `强`|
| `qiǎng`  | `抢`|
| `qiàng`  | `呛`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
