# --description--

The front nasal final `ian` may look like it has three parts: `i`, `a`, and `n`, but its real pronunciation is more like a fast blend of `i` and a light nasal ending.

Start by forming the high front vowel `i`, with your tongue close to the roof of your mouth and your lips slightly spread. Then, glide quickly into a very short transition sound similar to the `e` in `ie`, and end with the front nasal `n`, using the tip of your tongue behind your upper teeth. The sound should be smooth and continuous.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `bian`, `pian`, `mian`, `dian`, `nian`, and `lian`.

Let's practice pronouncing `ian` and the syllables, and then use `xian` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final and syllables.
