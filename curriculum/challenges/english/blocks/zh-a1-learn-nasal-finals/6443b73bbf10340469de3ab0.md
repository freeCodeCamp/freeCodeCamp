<!-- (Audio) Li Hong: ian, bian, pian, mian, dian, nian, xiān, xián, xiǎn, xiàn -->

# --description--

The front nasal final `ian` may look like it has three parts: `i`, `a`, and `n`, but its real pronunciation is more like a fast blend of `i` and a light nasal ending.

Start by forming the high front vowel `i`, with your tongue close to the roof of your mouth and your lips slightly spread. Then, glide quickly into a very short transition sound similar to the `e` in `ie`, and end with the front nasal `n`, using the tip of your tongue behind your upper teeth. The sound should be smooth and continuous.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `bian`, `pian`, `mian`, `dian`, `nian`, and `lian`.

Let's practice pronouncing `ian` and the syllables, and then use `xian` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `xiān`  | `先`|
| `xián`   | `咸`|
| `xiǎn`  | `显`|
| `xiàn`  | `现`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the nasal final and syllables.
