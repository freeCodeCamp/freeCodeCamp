`选项 (xuǎn xiàng)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `xuǎn` and `xiàng`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `x` with the final `üan` (the two dots of `ü` omitted after the initial `x`), and uses the third tone, which falls and then rises. The second syllable combines the initial `x` with the compound final `iang`, and uses the fourth tone, which is a falling tone.

`选项 (xuǎn xiàng)` is used when you are choosing between different choices, such as in a menu, a form, or a settings page.
