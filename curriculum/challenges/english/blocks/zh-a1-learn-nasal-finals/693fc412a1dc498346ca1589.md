`选项 (xuǎn xiàng)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `xuǎn` and `xiàng`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `x` with the compound final `üan`, and uses the third tone, which starts in the middle, falls to a low point and then rises again. Note that the `ü` is written as `u` after the initial `x`.

The second syllable combines the initial `x` with the compound final `iang`, and uses the fourth tone, which is a sharp falling tone.

`选项 (xuǎn xiàng)` refers to an option or choice, often used in the context of selecting from multiple possibilities.
