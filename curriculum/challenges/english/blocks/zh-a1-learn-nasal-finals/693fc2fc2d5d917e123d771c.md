## --sentence--

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`前端 (qián duān)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `qián` and `duān`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `q` with the compound final `ian`, and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high. The second syllable combines the initial `d` with the compound final `uan`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone.

`前端 (qián duān)` is used to talk about the part of a system or product that users see and interact with, such as pages, buttons, and layouts.
