# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `q` with the compound final `ian`, and uses the second tone, which is a rising tone. The second syllable combines the initial `d` with the compound final `uan`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone.

`前端 (qián duān)` refers to the front end, often used in the context of Web development or user interface design.
