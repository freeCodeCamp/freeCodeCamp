# --description--

There are 16 nasal finals in Pinyin. These are syllables that end with a nasal sound, either `n` (front nasal) or `ng` (back nasal).

The nasal final `an` is the first one you learn. It's made of a simple vowel plus a nasal ending.

To pronounce `an`, start with the short vowel `a`, then lightly close the airflow with your tongue touching behind your top teeth to make the `n` sound. Your lips should stay relaxed and slightly open. This is a front nasal final because the tongue tip makes the nasal sound in the front of the mouth.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `ban`, `pan`, `man`, `fan`, `dan`, `nan`, and `lan`.

To pronounce the syllable `ban`, begin with the sound of the initial `b` by pressing your lips together and releasing the sound softly. Then immediately move into the final `an`.

This same pattern applies to all syllables ending with `an`. Only the initial consonant changes at the beginning of the syllable. The key is to connect the initial sound smoothly to the final `an` without pausing.

Let's practice pronouncing `an` and the syllables, and then use `fan` in different tones as an example.
