# --explanation--

The question `¿Cómo te llamas?` means "What is your name?" but it literally translates to "How do you call yourself?"

`Te` – You (reflexive pronoun)

Used when the subject is also the object of the action.

`Llamas` – You call

It comes from the verb `llamarse` (to call oneself).
