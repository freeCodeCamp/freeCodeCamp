# --explanation--

To understand Mateo's response, focus first on how he describes his mood. Look for emotion words like `feliz`, `triste`, or `cansado`. Then, listen for actions in the past tense—verbs ending in `-é` often indicate what the speaker did (e.g., `comí`, `salí`, `bailé`). This helps you connect his emotional state with his recent activities.
