# --explanation--

`Te` is an indirect object pronoun that means "to you" in informal Spanish. It is used when someone is addressing or asking **you** directly. For example:

`¿Te gusta el café?` - Do you like coffee?

`Gusta` is a form of the verb `gustar`, which means "to be pleasing". Instead of saying "you like the job", you say "the job is pleasing to you". For example:

- `¿Te gusta la música?` – Do you like music?

- `¿Te gusta viajar?` – Do you like to travel?
