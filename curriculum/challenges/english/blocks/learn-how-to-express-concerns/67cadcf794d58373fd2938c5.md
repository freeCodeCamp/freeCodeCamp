# --explanation--

`A couple of` typically means `two`, but in casual speech, it can also mean `a few`. For example:

- `I saw a couple of emails about the issue.` - This usually means two, but could mean slightly more.

- `Give me a couple of minutes.` - This usually means two minutes, but might mean a few more.

There are plenty of other situations where English is not always literal, such as:

- `In a second` - This does not mean exactly one second; it means very soon.

- `Tons of work` - This does not mean actual weight; here, it means a lot of work.
