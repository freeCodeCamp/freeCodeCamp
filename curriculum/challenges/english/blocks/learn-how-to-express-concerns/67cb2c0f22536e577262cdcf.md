# --explanation--

`Could you...` is a polite way to begin a request of something from someone. `I'll...` is used in the answer to imply a promise or commitment to do something. For example:

- Person 1: `Could you send me the report by tomorrow?` - This person is asking for a report to be handed in on the following day.  

- Person 2: `Sure. I'll email it to you in the morning.` - This person promises to send the report via email.
