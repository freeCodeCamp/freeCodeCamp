# --explanation--

`Would` is used here to ask a **hypothetical question** about a possible future outcome. It suggests Maria is unsure and wants to know if her idea **might** be effective. For example:

`Would moving the deadline help the team finish on time?` - This means you are asking about a possible effect of changing the deadline.
