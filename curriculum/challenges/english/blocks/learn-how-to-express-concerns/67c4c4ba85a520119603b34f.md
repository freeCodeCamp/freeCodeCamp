`It might, but it's not BLANK.`  

## --blanks--

`ideal`

This word means something is not the best or most perfect solution.  

# --explanation--

Saying that something `is not ideal` means that it is not the best or most effective option, but it might still work. For example:

`Working on weekends is not ideal, but we have to meet the deadline.` - This means working on weekends is not the best situation, but it is necessary.
