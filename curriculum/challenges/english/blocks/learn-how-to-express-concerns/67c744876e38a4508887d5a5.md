<!-- (Audio) James: It's like there's always more to do. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.  

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Maria tell James she acknowledges the team's feelings?  

## --answers--

`I don't think that's true.`

### --feedback--

This dismisses James's concern instead of acknowledging it.

---

`I hear you.`

## --video-solution--

2  

# --explanation--

`I hear you` is used to acknowledge someone's feelings or concerns. It does not mean just listening â€” it shows understanding and empathy. For example:

- Person 1: `This heat wave is killing everyone.` - This means everyone is stressed by how hot it is these days.

- Person 2: `I hear you.` - This means the speaker recognizes and understands the other person's frustration.
