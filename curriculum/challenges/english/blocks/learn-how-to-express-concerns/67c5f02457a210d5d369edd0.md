<!-- (Audio) Maria: If we can focus on the critical parts of the project, we might still meet the deadline without overworking everyone. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Bob tell Maria he agrees with her idea of prioritizing tasks?  

## --answers--

`We should try something completely different.`  

### --feedback--

This suggests a new idea rather than agreeing with Maria.  

---

`That sounds like a plan.`

## --video-solution--

2  

# --explanation--

`That sounds like a plan.` is a way to express agreement and approval of an idea. It means the speaker thinks the suggestion is a good one. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's meet at 10 a.m. to go over the details.` - This person suggests a time for the meeting.

- Person 2: `That sounds like a plan!` - This person agrees with the plan.
