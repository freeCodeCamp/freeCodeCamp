<!-- (Audio) Maria: We might need to adjust the deadline even if it's just a few days. This would give the team some breathing room. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.  

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Bob tell Maria he will investigate to see if adjusting the deadline is a possibility?  

## --answers--

`I'll look into it.`  

---

`You should decide that on your own.`

### --feedback--

Maria is suggesting a discussion, not making a decision alone.

## --video-solution--

1  

# --explanation--

`To look into something` means to investigate or explore a matter further before making a decision. For example:

`I'll look into possible solutions and get back to you.` - This means the speaker will check available options and provide an answer later.
