# --explanation--

`A tight squeeze` literally means a small space where something barely fits. In this context, however, it is a metaphor meaning something is difficult to accomplish in a short amount of time. For example:

`Finishing this report by noon is going to be a tight squeeze.` - This means it will be difficult to complete the report before noon.
