`Workload` refers to the total amount of tasks or responsibilities a person has to complete. For example:

`His workload increased after two colleagues left the company.` - This means he has more tasks to do because fewer people are available.  

`Burnout` describes a state of extreme exhaustion due to prolonged stress or overwork. For example:

`She took a break from work to recover from burnout.` - This means she needed time off to regain her energy and well-being.
