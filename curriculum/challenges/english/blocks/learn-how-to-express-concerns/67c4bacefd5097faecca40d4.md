## --video-solution--

4  

# --explanation--

Using negatives in questions with auxiliary or modal verbs (such as `wouldn't`, `isn't`, `doesn't`), which require direct `yes`/`no` answers, suggests that the speaker expects the answer to be positive â€” Bob assumes, in this case, that working extra hours will help. Another example:

`Doesn't this plan seem like a good idea?` - The speaker expects the listener to agree that the plan is good.
