# --questions--

## --text--

What could James say to answer affirmatively to Maria's question?  

## --answers--

`Yes, that would be great.`

---

`Yes, that was great.`

### --feedback--

Here, James would be talking about something that happened in the past, not about a hypothetical future outcome.

## --video-solution--

1  

# --explanation--

`That would be great` is used to express enthusiasm and agreement with a suggestion. The use of `would` shows that the speaker is imagining the positive outcome of the idea. For example:

`If we could finish early, that would be great.` - This means finishing early is a desirable outcome.
