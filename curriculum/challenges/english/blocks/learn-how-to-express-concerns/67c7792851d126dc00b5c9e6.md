# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.  

# --questions--

## --text--

What could Maria say to James to acknowledge his feedback?  

## --answers--

`That's not important.`

### --feedback--

This dismisses James's concern instead of acknowledging it.  

---

`I understand.`  

## --video-solution--

2  

# --explanation--

`I understand` is used to acknowledge someone's feelings or concerns. It shows that the listener recognizes what the speaker is saying, even if they don't have a solution yet. For example:

`I understand that the deadline is stressful. Let's figure out how to manage it.` - This means the speaker recognizes the stress and wants to address it.
