<!-- (Audio) James: Yes, that would be great. Thanks for listening, Maria. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.  

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Yes, that would be great. Thanks for BLANK, Maria.`  

## --blanks--

`listening`  

### --feedback--

This means to pay attention to what someone is saying using your ears. Use the `-ing` form as it follows a preposition.

# --explanation--

When a verb follows a preposition (such as `for`), it must be in the **`-ing`** form. For example:

`She apologized for being late.` - Here, `being` follows the preposition `for`, so it takes the `-ing` form.
