# --explanation--

`I'll see if I can...` is used to introduce someone's plans to attempt something. The person, however, is not sure if they will succeed. For example:

`I'll see if I can find a solution before the deadline.` - This means the speaker will try to find a solution, but it is not guaranteed.
