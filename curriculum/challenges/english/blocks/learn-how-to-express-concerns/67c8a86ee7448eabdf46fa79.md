# --explanation--

`Sometimes` at the beginning of a sentence emphasizes that the situation happens occasionally but not always. It can also be placed before the main verb, but placing it first can add a natural flow to speech. For example:

`Sometimes we forget how important breaks are.` - This means it happens occasionally.

`Too` is used as an intensifier and it means excessively or more than desired. It differs from `very` or `so`, which only emphasize degree but do not indicate excess. For example:

- `It's too late.` - This means it's later than acceptable.

- `This exercise is too difficult.` - This means the exercise is more difficult than necessary.
