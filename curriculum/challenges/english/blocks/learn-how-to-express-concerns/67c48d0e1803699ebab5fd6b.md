# --explanation--

When using an adjective followed by an infinitive, the negative form is made by adding `not to` before the verb. For example:

- Affirmative: `She was happy to help with the project.` - This means helping with the project made her happy.

- Negative: `He was careful not to forget the deadline.` - This means he made sure he remembered it.

`To burn out` means to become extremely tired or exhausted from too much work. For example:

`If we don't take breaks, we might burn out before the project is finished.` - This means working without resting could cause exhaustion.
