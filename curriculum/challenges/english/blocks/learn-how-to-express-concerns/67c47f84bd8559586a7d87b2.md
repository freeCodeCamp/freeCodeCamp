# --explanation--

`To work hard` means to put in a lot of effort. Notice that the adverb for `hard` in this case is also `hard`, not `hardly`. `To hardly work` means to do almost no work at all, to make little to no effort, which is the opposite of what Maria is saying about the team. For example:

- `She hardly trained for the marathon.` - This means she did not make any effort to be prepared for the marathon.

- `She trained hard for the marathon.` - This means she put in a lot of effort to prepare.
