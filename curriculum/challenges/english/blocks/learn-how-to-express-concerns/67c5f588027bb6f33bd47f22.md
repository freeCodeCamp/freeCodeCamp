When you say something `works smoothly`, it means that something happens without difficulties or interruptions. `Smoothly` comes from `smooth`, which describes something without roughness or obstacles, but they are used in different contexts. For example:

- `The table has a smooth surface.` - This describes the table as having no rough areas.  

- `The software update helped the system run more smoothly.` - This means the system now operates with fewer issues.
