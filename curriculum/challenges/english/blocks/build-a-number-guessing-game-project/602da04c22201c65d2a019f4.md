# --description--

This is one of the required projects to earn your certification. For this project, you will use Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information.

# --instructions--

**Important:** After you pass all the project tests, save a dump of your database into a `number_guess.sql` file, as well as your `number_guess.sh` file, so you can complete step 2. There will be instructions on how to do that within the virtual machine.

# --notes--

Required files: `number_guess.sql`, `number_guess.sh`
