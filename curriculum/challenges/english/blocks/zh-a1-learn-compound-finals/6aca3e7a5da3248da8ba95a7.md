### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `shuāi` and `tuì`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `sh` with the compound final `uai`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone. The second syllable combines the initial `t` with the compound final `ui`, and uses the fourth tone, which is a falling tone.

`衰退 (shuāi tuì)` is used when something becomes weaker or decreases over time, such as performance, activity, or growth.
