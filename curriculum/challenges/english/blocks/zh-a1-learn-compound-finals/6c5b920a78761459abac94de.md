<!-- (Audio) Lin Yating: ie, bie, pie, tie, nie, xie, xiē, xié, xiě, xiè -->

# --description--

`ie` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`. Then, without breaking the sound, relax the tongue and lower the jaw slightly into the position for `e`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ie` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bie`, `pie`, `tie`, `nie`, and `xie`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `xie` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `xiē`  | `些`|
| `xié`   | `协`|
| `xiě`  | `写`|
| `xiè`  | `谢`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and syllables.
