<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: ie, bie, pie, tie, nie, xie -->

# --description--

`ie` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`. Then, without breaking the sound, relax the tongue and lower the jaw slightly into the position for `e`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ie` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bie`, `pie`, `tie`, `nie`, `xie`.
