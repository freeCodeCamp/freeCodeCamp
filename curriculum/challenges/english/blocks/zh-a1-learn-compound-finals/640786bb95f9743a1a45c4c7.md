`交流 (jiāo liú)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `jiāo` and `liú`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `j` with the compound final `iao`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone. The second syllable combines the initial `l` with the compound final `iou` (written as `iu`), and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high.

`交流 (jiāo liú)` refers to people sharing ideas, thoughts, or information with one another.
