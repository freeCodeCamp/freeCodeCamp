<!-- (Audio) speaker: ia, jia, qia, xia, lia, jiā, jiá, jiǎ, jià -->

# --description--

`ia` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`. Then, without breaking the sound, open the mouth wider into the position for `a`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ia` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `jia`, `qia`, `xia`, and `lia`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `jia` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `jiā`  | `加`|
| `jiá`   | `夹`|
| `jiǎ`  | `假`|
| `jià`  | `价`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and syllables.
