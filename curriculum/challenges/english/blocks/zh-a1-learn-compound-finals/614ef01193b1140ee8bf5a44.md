<!-- (Audio) Lin Yating: uo, duo, tuo, guo, zhuo, shuo, guō, guó, guǒ, guò -->

# --description--

`uo` starts with the tongue positioned for `u`, with the lips rounded and protruded. Then, without breaking the sound, relax the tongue and lower the jaw slightly into the position for `o`.

When `uo` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `duo`, `tuo`, `guo`, `zhuo`, and `shuo`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `guo` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `guō`  | `锅`|
| `guó`   | `国`|
| `guǒ`  | `果`|
| `guò`  | `过`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and syllables.
