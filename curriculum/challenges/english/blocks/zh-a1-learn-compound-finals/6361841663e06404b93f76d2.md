`叠加 (dié jiā)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `dié` and `jiā`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `d` with the compound final `ie`, and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high. The second syllable combines the initial `j` with the compound final `ia`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone.

`叠加 (dié jiā)` refers to adding things together layer by layer so their effects combine.
