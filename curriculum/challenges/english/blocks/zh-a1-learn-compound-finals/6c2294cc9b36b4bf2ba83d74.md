<!-- (Audio) A: ao, bao, dao, gao, kao, zao, chao -->

# --description--

To pronounce the compound final `ao`, you begin with the mouth open wide for the `a` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `o`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `a` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `o` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ao` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bao`, `dao`, `gao`, `kao`, `zao`, `chao`.
