<!-- (Audio) Lin Yating: ao, bao, dao, gao, kao, zao, chao, zāo, záo, zǎo, zào -->

# --description--

To pronounce the compound final `ao`, you begin with the mouth open wide for the `a` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `o`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `a` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `o` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ao` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bao`, `dao`, `gao`, `kao`, `zao`, and `chao`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `zao` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `zāo`  | `遭`|
| `záo`   | `凿`|
| `zǎo`  | `早`|
| `zào`  | `造`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and syllables.
