<!-- (Audio) speaker: uai, kuai, guai, huai, chuai, shuai, guāi, guǎi, guài -->

# --description--

To pronounce `uai`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`, then smoothly transition to the position for `a`, and finally to the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `uai` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `kuai`, `guai`, `huai`, `chuai`, `shuai`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `guai` in its four tones as an example.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and the syllables.
