`协作 (xié zuò)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `xié` and `zuò`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `x` with the compound final `ie`, and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high. The second syllable combines the initial `z` with the compound final `uo`, and uses the fourth tone, which falls sharply from high to low.

`协作 (xié zuò)` describes people actively working together toward a shared goal, coordinating their efforts, communicating, and supporting each other.
