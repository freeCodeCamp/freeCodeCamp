<!-- (Audio) speaker: iao, biao, miao, diao, jiao, qiao, xiao, mīao, miáo, miǎo, miào -->

# --description--

To pronounce `iao`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`, then smoothly transition to the position for `a`, and finally to the position for `o`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `iao` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `biao`, `miao`, `diao`, `jiao`, `qiao`, `xiao`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `miao` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `mīao`  | `喵`|
| `miáo`   | `苗`|
| `miǎo`  | `秒`|
| `miào`  | `妙`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and syllables.
