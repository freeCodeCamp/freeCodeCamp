<!-- (Audio) speaker: ou, mou, fou, dou, kou, zou, shou, shōu, shóu, shǒu, shòu -->

# --description--

To pronounce the compound final `ou`, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `o` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `u`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `o` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `u` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ou` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `mou`, `fou`, `dou`, `kou`, `zou`, and `shou`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `shou` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and the syllables.
