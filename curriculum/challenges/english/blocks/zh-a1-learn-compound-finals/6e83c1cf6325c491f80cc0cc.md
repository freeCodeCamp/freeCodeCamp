<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ou, mou, fou, dou, kou, zou, shou -->

# --description--

To pronounce the compound final `ou`, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `o` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `u`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `o` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `u` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ou` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `mou`, `fou`, `dou`, `kou`, `zou`, `shou`.
