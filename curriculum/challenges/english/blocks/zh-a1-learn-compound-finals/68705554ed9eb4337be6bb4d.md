<!-- (Audio) A: shuǐ -->

# --description--

`uei` is often written as `ui` in syllables. As `i` and `u` appear together in `ui`, the tone mark goes on the second vowel, which is `i`. For example, `chuī`.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the syllable with the correct tone mark.

`shuǐ`

### --feedback--

This syllable combines the initial `sh` with the final `uei` (written as `ui`), and uses the third tone, which dips down and then rises.
