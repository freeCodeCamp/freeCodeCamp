<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ei, bei, lei, fei, pei, zei, shei -->

# --description--

`ei` is another compound final. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `e` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `e` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `i` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ei` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bei`, `lei`, `fei`, `pei`, `zei`, and `shei`.

The pronunciation method is similar to what you have learned for `ai`.
