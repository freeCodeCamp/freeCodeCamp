<!-- (Audio) speaker: ei, bei, lei, fei, pei, zei, shei, fēi, féi, fěi, fèi -->

# --description--

`ei` is another compound final. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `e` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `e` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `i` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ei` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bei`, `lei`, `fei`, `pei`, `zei`, and `shei`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `fei` in its four tones as an example.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and the syllables.
