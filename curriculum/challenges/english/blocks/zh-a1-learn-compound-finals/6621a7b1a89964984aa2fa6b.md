<!-- (Audio) Lin Yating: bǎi -->

# --description--

You've learned that tone marks are always placed on finals, not initials. If there is more than one vowel in a syllable, here are three rules for deciding which vowel gets the tone mark:

- If there is `a`, the tone mark is placed on `a`.

- If there is no `a`, but there is `o` or `e`, the tone mark goes on whichever appears. These two will never appear together in the same final.

- If `i` and `u` appear together, the tone mark goes on the second one.

Because `ai` contains `a`, the tone mark goes on the `a`. For example, `lái`.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the syllable with the correct tone mark.

## --sentence--

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`bǎi`

### --feedback--

This syllable combines the initial `b` with the final `ai`, and uses the third tone.

# --explanation--

The audio pronounces the syllable `bǎi`, which consists of the initial `b` and the compound final `ai`. The tone mark is placed on the `a`, following the rule that if `a` is present, it receives the tone mark.

The syllable uses the third tone, which starts in the middle, falls to a low point and then rises again.
