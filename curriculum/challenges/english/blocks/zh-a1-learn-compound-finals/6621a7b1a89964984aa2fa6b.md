<!-- (Audio) A: tài -->

# --description--

You've learned that tone marks are always placed on vowels, not on consonants. If there is more than one vowel in a syllable, here are three rules for deciding which vowel gets the tone mark:

- If there is `a`, the tone mark is placed on `a`.

- If there is no `a`, but there is `o` or `e`, the tone mark goes on whichever appears. These two will never appear together in the same final.

- If `i` and `u` appear together, the tone mark goes on the second one.

Because `ai` contains `a`, the tone mark goes on the `a`. For example, `lái`.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the syllable with the correct tone mark.

## --sentence--

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`tài`

### --feedback--

This syllable combines the initial `t` with the final `ai`, and uses the fourth tone, which falls sharply from high to low.
