`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`hēi`

### --feedback--

This syllable combines the initial `h` with the final `ei`, and uses the first tone.

# --explanation--

The audio pronounces the syllable `hēi`, which consists of the initial `h` and the compound final `ei`. The tone mark is placed on the `e`, following the rule that if there is no `a`, but there is `o` or `e`, the tone mark goes on whichever appears.

The syllable is pronounced with the first tone, which is a high-level tone.
