<!-- (Audio) Lin Yating: 黑白 (hēi bái) -->

# --description--

Now you will practice identifying `ai` and `ei` in a word. The two characters in this word are complete opposites. When they are put together, they form a very common and interesting pair in Chinese.

Again, don't worry about what the word means. Just notice how Pinyin helps you produce the characters.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the word below.

`黑白 (hēi bái)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `hēi` and `bái`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `h` with the compound final `ei`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone. The second syllable combines the initial `b` with the compound final `ai`, and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high.

`黑白 (hēi bái)` literally means "black and white". It is often used metaphorically to mean right and wrong or clear moral distinction.
