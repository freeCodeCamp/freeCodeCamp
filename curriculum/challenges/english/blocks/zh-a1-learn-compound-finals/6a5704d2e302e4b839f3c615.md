`黑白 (hēi bái)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `hēi` and `bái`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `h` with the compound final `ei`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone. The second syllable combines the initial `b` with the compound final `ai`, and uses the second tone, which rises from mid to high.

`黑白 (hēi bái)` literally means "black and white". It is also often used metaphorically to mean right and wrong or clear moral distinction.
