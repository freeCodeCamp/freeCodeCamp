<!-- (Audio) A: iou, liu, jiu, qiu, xiu, you -->

# --description--

To pronounce `iou`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`, then smoothly transition to the position for `o`, and finally to the position for `u`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

In syllables, `iou` is often written as `iu`.

When `iou` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `liu`, `jiu`, `qiu`, `xiu`, `you`.
