<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: iou, liu, jiu, qiu, xiu, you -->

# --description--

To pronounce `iou`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`, then smoothly transition to the position for `o`, and finally to the position for `u`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

In syllables, `iou` is often written as `iu`.

When `iou` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `liu`, `jiu`, `qiu`, `xiu`, `you`.

While liucontains a flowing, three-part vowel sequence (i→o→u), the vowel in lüis a single, stable sound.

The key difference lies in the mouth movement. For liu, your tongue and lips glide smoothly through different positions. For lü, focus on creating a single, fixed shape: round your lips tightly into a small circle (as if whistling) while keeping the front of your tongue high and forward. There is no sliding motion; the sound is steady.

A helpful trick is to start by saying a long isound (as in "see"), and then, without moving your tongue, slowly round your lips. The sound will change from idirectly to ü, giving you the correct vowel for lü.

Compare the sounds:

liù(六 - six): Your mouth moves.

lǜ(绿 - green): Your mouth stays in one rounded position.
