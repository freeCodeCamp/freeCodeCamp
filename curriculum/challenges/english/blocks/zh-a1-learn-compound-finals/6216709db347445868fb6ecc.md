<!-- (Audio) speaker: iou, liu, jiu, qiu, xiu, liū, liú, liǔ, liù -->

# --description--

To pronounce `iou`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for the `i`​ sound. Then, in one fluid, continuous motion, you glide the tongue backward and downward into the more open, rounded position for `o`, immediately followed by a further backward movement and tighter lip rounding for the `u`​ sound. The entire movement should be seamless, forming a single, unbroken syllable.

When it comes after an initial, `iou` is often written as `iu`. That's why you see syllables like `liu`, `jiu`, `qiu`, and `xiu`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `liu` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `liū`  | `溜`|
| `liú`   | `流`|
| `liǔ`  | `柳`|
| `liù`  | `六`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and syllables.
