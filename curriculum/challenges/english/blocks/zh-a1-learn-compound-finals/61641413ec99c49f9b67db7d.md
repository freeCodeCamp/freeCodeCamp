<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: üe, nüe, lüe -->

# --description--

`üe` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `ü`. Then, without breaking the sound, relax the tongue and lower the jaw slightly into the position for `e`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `üe` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `nüe` and `lüe`.

[ ] pronouncing `üe`
[ ] pronouncing `nüe`
[ ] pronouncing `lüe`

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final and the syllables.
