## --blanks--

`高手 (gāo shǒu)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `gāo` and `shǒu`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable combines the initial `g` with the compound final `ao`, and uses the first tone, which is a high-level tone. The second syllable combines the initial `sh` with the compound final `ou`, and uses the third tone, which starts in the middle, falls to a low point and then rises again..

`高手 (gāo shǒu)` refers to an expert or a master in a particular field.
