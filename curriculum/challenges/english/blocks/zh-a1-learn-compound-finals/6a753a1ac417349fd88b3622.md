<!-- (Audio) speaker: ua, hua, kua, gua, shua, huā, huá, huà -->

# --description--

`ua` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`. Then, without breaking the sound, open the mouth wider into the position for `a`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ua` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `hua`, `kua`, `gua`, and `shua`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `hua` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and the syllables.
