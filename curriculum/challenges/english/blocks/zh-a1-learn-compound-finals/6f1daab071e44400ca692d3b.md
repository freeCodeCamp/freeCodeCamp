<!-- (Audio) speaker: uei, dui, tui, gui, kui, zhui, shui, tuī, tuí, tuǐ, tuì -->

# --description--

To pronounce `uei`, you begin by rounding your lips slightly for `u` and placing the tongue high toward the back of the mouth. Then relax the lips a little for `e` and move the tongue forward and lower to create a more open, mid-level sound. Finally, narrow the mouth shape for `i` and raise the front of the tongue toward the upper front teeth. All three movements should connect smoothly in a single glide, without stopping between the sounds.

When it comes after an initial, `uei` is often written as `ui`. That's why you see the syllables like `dui`, `tui`, `gui`, `kui`, `zhui`, `shui`.

Let's practice pronouncing these syllables, and then use `tui` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounce the compound final and the syllables.
