<!-- (Audio) A: ai, bai, tai, gai, kai, cai, zhai -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`ai` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth open wide for the `a` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `a` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `i` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ai` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `bai`, `tai`, `gai`, `kai`, `cai`, and `zhai`.

For pronouncing `bai`, start by forming the `b` sound with your lips pressed together. Then, open your mouth wide to pronounce `a`, followed by a smooth transition to `i`. The key is to connect the consonant and the vowel in one fluid motion without pausing between them.

You can use this same method of smoothly linking `b` directly into the vowel for other syllables. The only difference will be the consonant sound you make at the beginning.
