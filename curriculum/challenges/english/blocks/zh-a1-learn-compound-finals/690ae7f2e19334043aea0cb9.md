<!-- (Audio) speaker: er, ér, ěr, èr -->

# --description--

`er` is a special final in Pinyin. It can function as a standalone syllable

To pronounce `er`, you begin by producing the sound of the simple final `e`. While sustaining the sound, gently raise and curl the tip of your tongue backward without touching the roof of the mouth, then release quickly. The result is a retroflex, rhotic vowel.

Let's practice pronouncing `er`​ in different tones.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `ér`  | `儿`|
| `ěr`   | `耳`|
| `èr`  | `二`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and pronounced the special final and syllables.
