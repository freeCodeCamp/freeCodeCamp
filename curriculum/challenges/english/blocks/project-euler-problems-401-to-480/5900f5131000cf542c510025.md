# --description--

Let $H$ be the hyperbola defined by the equation $12x^2 + 7xy - 12y^2 = 625$.

Next, define $X$ as the point (7, 1). It can be seen that $X$ is in $H$.

Now we define a sequence of points in $H, \\{P_i : i â‰¥ 1\\}$, as:

- $P_1 = (13, \frac{61}{4})$.
- $P_2 = (\frac{-43}{6}, -4)$.
- For $i > 2$, $P_i$ is the unique point in $H$ that is different from $P_{i - 1}$ and such that line $P_iP_{i - 1}$ is parallel to line $P_{i - 2}X$. It can be shown that $P_i$ is well-defined, and that its coordinates are always rational.

You are given that $P_3 = (\frac{-19}{2}, \frac{-229}{24})$, $P_4 = (\frac{1267}{144}, \frac{-37}{12})$ and $P_7 = (\frac{17\\,194\\,218\\,091}{143\\,327\\,232}, \frac{274\\,748\\,766\\,781}{1\\,719\\,926\\,784})$.

Find $P_n$ for $n = {11}^{14}$ in the following format: If $P_n = (\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d})$ where the fractions are in lowest terms and the denominators are positive, then the answer is $(a + b + c + d)\bmod 1\\,000\\,000\\,007$.

For $n = 7$, the answer would have been: $806\\,236\\,837$.

# --hints--

`sequenceOfPointsOnHyperbola()` should return `92060460`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(sequenceOfPointsOnHyperbola(), 92060460);
```
