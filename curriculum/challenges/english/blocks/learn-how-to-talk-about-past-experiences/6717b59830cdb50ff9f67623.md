# --explanation--

`Learning curve` refers to the time, effort, and challenges involved in gaining knowledge or mastering a new skill. For example: 

`Switching to the new software was a steep learning curve for the employees.` - This implies the employees had a lot of difficulty learning how to operate the new software.

In this context, Linda is describing how working with security aspects required the team to learn and adapt, and that they possibly faced some difficulties along the way.
