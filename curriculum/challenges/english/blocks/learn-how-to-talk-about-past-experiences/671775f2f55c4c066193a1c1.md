<!-- (Audio) Linda: You were fixing a security issue, weren't you? --> 

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Jake tell Linda that was precisely what was happening at that time?

## --answers--

`Exactly.`

---

`I think so.`

### --feedback--

This answer means you agree with the other person, you believe they are right, but you are not sure of it.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Exactly` is used to confirm or strongly agree with something someone else has said. It indicates that the statement is fully correct. For example: 

Person 1: `Did you mean we should start testing today?`

Person 2: `Exactly.` - meaning you are sure the tests should start today.

In this context, Jake could say `Exactly` to confirm that he was indeed fixing a security issue back then as Linda mentioned.
