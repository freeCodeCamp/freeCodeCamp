# --explanation--

The `user interface` (UI) refers to the part of a system or software that users interact with directly, such as buttons, menus, and screens. For example: 

`The user interface was redesigned to be more intuitive.` - Meaning the part of the software the user interacts with was improved.

`User feedback` refers to opinions, suggestions, or issues reported by users about their experience with a product or service. For example: 

`The company improved the app based on user feedback.` - Meaning the comments and suggestions coming from the users were read and used to make the app better.

In this context, Linda explains that the team relied on user feedback to make constant improvements to the user interface, ensuring it met the needs of users.
