# --explanation--

`Which` is a relative pronoun used to provide additional information about something mentioned earlier in the sentence. In this case, `which` refers to the entire idea of checking the updates a day later and clarifies that it wasn't ideal. For example:

`She missed the deadline, which caused a delay in the project.` - Here, `which` refers to `missing the deadline` and explains the resulting delay.

Similarly, Jake uses `which` to express that checking updates a day later wasn't the best practice.
