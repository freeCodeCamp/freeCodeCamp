# --explanation--

The verb `overlook` means to fail to notice or consider something important, often unintentionally. For example: 

`The team overlooked a critical error in the report, causing delays.` - Here, `overlooked` refers to failing to notice an error that had significant consequences.

In this context, Jake is stressing that ignoring or neglecting this aspect would be a mistake.
