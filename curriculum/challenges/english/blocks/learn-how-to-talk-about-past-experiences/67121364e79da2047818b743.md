# --explanation--

`Notice` means to become aware of something by seeing, hearing, or sensing it. It often implies paying attention to details. For example: 

`I noticed the error in the report before the meeting.` - This means you saw there was an error. 

It can refer to becoming aware of both physical things and situations. In this sentence, Jake means that he observed or became aware that the team was using user feedback to improve the user interface.
