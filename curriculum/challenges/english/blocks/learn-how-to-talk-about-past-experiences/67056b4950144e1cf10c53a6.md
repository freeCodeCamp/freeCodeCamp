This is James' email to his team.

`To: Team`

`Hey team,`

`I found the bug from yesterday. First, I checked the recent code changes but didn't see anything. Then, I looked at the error logs and realized the system wasn't connecting to the database properly. We hadn't updated the credentials after the last security patch. I fixed the credentials, and the app is now running smoothly!`

`Best regards,`
`James`

What would be the most appropriate subject for James' email to the team?

## --answers--

`Update on the system connection issue`

### --feedback--

This subject is relevant but a bit too vague about the exact problem James fixed.

---

`Bug fixed. Database credentials updated`

---

`Security patch problems`

### --feedback--

This subject is misleading because the security patch wasn't the problem, it was the credentials not being updated after the patch.

---

`Error logs reviewed. No issues found`

### --feedback--

This subject is incorrect because James did find an issue while reviewing the error logs.
