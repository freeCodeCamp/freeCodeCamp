# --explanation--

AI stands for `Artificial Intelligence`, a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. For example: 

`AI is being used to improve natural language processing in chatbots.` - This means that Artificial Intelligence is used to help chatbots communicate in a more efficient way with humans.

An `AI workshop` is a session or event where participants learn about AI concepts, tools, or applications. These workshops often include hands-on activities to help attendees understand and implement AI technologies. For example: 

`The AI workshop covered topics like machine learning and neural networks.` - This means the AI workshop taught machine learning and neural networks.

In this dialog, Maria confirms that she attended an AI workshop yesterday.
