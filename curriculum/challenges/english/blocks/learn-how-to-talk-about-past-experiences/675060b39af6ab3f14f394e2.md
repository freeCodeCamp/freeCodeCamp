# --explanation--

James means that the situation improved right after the database issue was resolved. He uses `Not really` to indicate that no major issues occurred, though there may have been minor or insignificant ones. This phrase is often used to soften a negative response. For example: 

Person 1: `Did you enjoy the movie?` 

Person 2: `Not really. It was too slow.` - This means you did not like the movie much.

`Smoothly` is an adverb meaning without problems or interruptions. While `smoothly` (adverb) describes how an action is performed, `smooth` (adjective) describes a state or quality. For example:

`The meeting went smoothly after everyone arrived on time.` - This means everything was ok at the meeting.

`The surface of the table is smooth.` - Meaning there were no inconsistencies in the surface.

`Once` means the same as `as soon as` or `after`, indicating that everything ran smoothly after the database was fixed. For example: - `Once the updates were installed, the system worked perfectly.` (this means that the system worked after the updates were installed)
