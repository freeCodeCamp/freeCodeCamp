# --explanation--

`Would` in this context expresses a habitual action or repeated behavior in the past. It is often used to describe actions that someone regularly performed, similar to `used to`. 

However, `would` focuses more on the action itself, while `used to` can describe states or habits. For example:

- `She would always read a book before going to bed.` - Reading a book before going to bed was a common action for her.  

`She used to live in New York before moving here.` - here `used to` is used because living in a place expresses a state of things not an action or something you would habitually do.

In this sentence, Maria uses `would` to describe Brian's repeated habit of staying late to fine-tune the code, which emphasizes his dedication.
