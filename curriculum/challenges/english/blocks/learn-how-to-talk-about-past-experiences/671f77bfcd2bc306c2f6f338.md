# --explanation--

To `brainstorm` means to generate ideas or solutions through an open, collaborative discussion, often in a group. It focuses on creativity and problem-solving. For example: 

`The team brainstormed ideas for the new marketing campaign.` - This means that the team collaboratively discussed new ideas together for the new marketing campaign.

`Straight` in this context means continuously or without stopping. It emphasizes uninterrupted activity. For example: 

`He studied for five hours straight to prepare for the exam.` - This means he did not stop studying for five hours to prepare for the exam.

In this sentence, Maria explains that they brainstormed for two continuous hours during the design sprint workshop.
