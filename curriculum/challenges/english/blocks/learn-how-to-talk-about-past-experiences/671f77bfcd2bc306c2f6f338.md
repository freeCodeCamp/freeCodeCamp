# --explanation--

To `brainstorm` means to generate ideas or solutions through an open, collaborative discussion, often in a group. It focuses on creativity and problem-solving. For example: 

`The team brainstormed ideas for the new marketing campaign.` - This means that the team collaboratively discussed new ideas together for the new marketing campaign.

`Straight` in this context means continuously or without stopping. It emphasizes uninterrupted activity. For example: 

`He studied for five hours straight to prepare for the exam.` - This means he did not stop studying for five hours to prepare for the exam.
