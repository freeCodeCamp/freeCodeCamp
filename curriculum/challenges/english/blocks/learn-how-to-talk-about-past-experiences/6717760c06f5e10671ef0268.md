# --explanation--

A `major vulnerability` is a significant weakness or flaw in a system that could lead to serious consequences if exploited. It usually requires urgent attention to protect the system or data. For example: 

`The team discovered a major vulnerability in the software that could allow unauthorized access.` - This means the weakness was a serious one.

`Immediate action` refers to steps that must be taken right away to address a pressing issue or problem. For example: 

`When the server crashed, the team took immediate action to restore functionality.` - This means the team acted as fast as they could to restore the server's functionality. 

In this dialogue, Jake explains that the vulnerability was serious enough to require urgent measures to prevent potential risks.
