## --blanks--

`more`

### --feedback--

`carefully`

### --feedback--

This word is an adverb that describes how the action was performed, with care.

# --explanation--

`More carefully` uses `more` to intensify the adverb `carefully`, which describes the way James reviewed the error logs. Adverbs like `carefully` modify verbs, showing how an action is performed.  

If you compare `more careful` and `more carefully`, the difference is in the fact that `more careful` is an adjective phrase describing a noun (person, place, or thing). For example: 

`She was more careful with her calculations.` - Here, `more careful` describes the subject/person, `she`. 

`More carefully` is an adverb phrase, which describes how the action is performed. For example: 

`She checked her calculations more carefully.` - It describes how the calculations were `checked` - in other words, it describes the action of `checking`, not the person who `checks`.  

In James's sentence, `more carefully` explains that James increased the level of attention or detail in the reviewing of the logs. It describes the review, not James.
