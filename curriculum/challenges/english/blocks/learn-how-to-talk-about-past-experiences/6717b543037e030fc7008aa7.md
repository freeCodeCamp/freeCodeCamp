### --feedback--

# --explanation--

The verb `address` in this context means to deal with or resolve an issue or problem. Jake was focusing on resolving the matter while the team waited for his approval. For example: 

`The manager addressed the client's concerns during the meeting.` - Here, `addressed` refers to taking action to deal with the client's concerns.

In the sentence, Jake uses the `Past Continuous` (`was addressing`) to describe the ongoing action of resolving the issue while another ongoing action (`the team was waiting`) happened simultaneously.
