## --text--

How could James tell Lisa that he found the bug using a very short answer to say it?

## --answers--

`Yes, I found it.`

### --feedback--

# --explanation--

When giving short answers to a question directed to you about something you did or did not do in the past, use `Yes, I did.` or `No, I didn't` to answer to them briefly. For example:

- `Did you buy that car you wanted? No, I didn't.` - This means you did not buy the car.

- `Did you pass the English test? Yes, I did` - This means you passed the test.
