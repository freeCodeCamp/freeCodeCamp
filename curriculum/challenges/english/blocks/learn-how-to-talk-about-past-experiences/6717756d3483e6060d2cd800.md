# --explanation--

In the interrogative form, `used to` asks about past habits or routines that may no longer be true. The structure is: `Did` + subject + `use to` + base verb`?` For example: 

`Did you use to attend weekly meetings?` - You are asking if the other person normally attended the meetings. 

A `vulnerability` is a weakness or flaw that can be exploited, especially in the context of security. For example: 

`The team identified a vulnerability in the system that needed immediate attention.` - There was a weak spot in the system that had to be dealt with.

In this sentence, Linda is asking if checking updates for security weaknesses was a regular part of their past process.
