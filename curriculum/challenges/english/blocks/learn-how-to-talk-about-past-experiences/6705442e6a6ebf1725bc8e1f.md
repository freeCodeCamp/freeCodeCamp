# --explanation--

The verb `to be` in the `Simple Past` is used to describe or ask about states or characteristics in the past. The forms are `was` (singular) and `were` (plural). For example:  

- Affirmative: `The meeting was productive.` - You had a good opinion about the meeting

- Negative: `The meeting wasn't productive.` - Your opinion about the meeting was that it was a waste of time.

In questions, the verb `to be` and the subject are inverted. For example:

- Affirmative sentence: `It was a bug.` - You're confirming the presence of a bug in the code.

- Question: `Was it a bug?` - You want to know if it was a bug. Notice `was` goes before `it` here.

In this dialogue, Lisa asks `What was it?` to ask James to identify what the `something odd` that he noticed was.
