<!-- (Audio) James: Then I reviewed the error logs more carefully. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK I reviewed the error logs more carefully.`

## --blanks--

`Then`

### --feedback--

This word is used to show the next step in a sequence of actions. It's in the beginning of the sentence, so don't forget to capitalize it.

# --explanation--

`Then` is used to indicate the next action in a sequence of events. It shows what happens after something else. For example:  

- `I turned on the computer, and then I opened my email.` - You only opened the email after turning on the computer.

- `We fixed the bug, then we tested the application again.` - They only tested the application again after fixing the bug.

In James's sentence, he uses `then` to explain the next action he took after checking the recent changes made to the code. 

Other words and phrases that can be used with the same meaning as `then` in this context are `after that` and `next`. For example:

- `I checked the updates. After that, I started debugging.` 

- `I reviewed the requirements. Next, I shared my thoughts with the team.`.

These words help structure descriptions of actions in chronological order.
