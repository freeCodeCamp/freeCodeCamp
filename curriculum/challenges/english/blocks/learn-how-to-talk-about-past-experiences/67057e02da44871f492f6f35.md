This is James' email to his team.

`To: Team`

`Subject: Bug fixed. Database credentials updated`

`Hey team,`

`I found the bug from yesterday. First, I checked the recent code changes but didn't see anything. Then, I looked at the error logs and realized the system wasn't connecting to the database properly. We hadn't updated the credentials after the last security patch. I fixed the credentials, and the app is now running smoothly!`
