<!-- SPEAKING -->

<!-- (Audio) Brian: I attended some really interesting sessions these last few days. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Maria succinctly tell Brian she attended some sessions at PyCon as well?

## --answers--

`Yeah, me too.`

---

`Why not?`

### --feedback--

`Why not?` doesn't indicate agreement or a shared experience.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Me too` is used to express agreement or show that the same statement applies to the speaker. It is a concise and informal way to respond to shared experiences or feelings.  For example: 

Person 1: `I love Python programming.` 

Person 2: `Me too.`  - Meaning they love programming in Python as well.

In this context, Maria could say `Yeah, me too` to quickly let Brian know that she also attended really interesting sessions at PyCon.
