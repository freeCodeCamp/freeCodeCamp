<!-- (Audio) James: That's when I noticed something odd. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Lisa ask **in a short way** about James's discovery in the error logs?

## --answers--

`What was the odd thing that you found when you were reviewing the error logs?`

### --feedback--

Even though this is exactly what she wants to know, it is not a short question.

---

`What was it?`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

James talks about `something odd`. Lisa asks him to identify what this odd thing (`it`) was by asking `What was it?`. `Was` is used because it is a singular thing (`something odd`) and it was found in the past, when James reviewed the error logs.

Remember that, in questions, you normally invert verb and subject, so `it was` becomes `was it`. For example:

- `It was fun!` - You're saying you liked an activity.

- `Was it fun?` - You're asking the other person if they liked it.
