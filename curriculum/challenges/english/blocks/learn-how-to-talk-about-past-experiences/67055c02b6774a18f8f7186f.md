## --sentence--

`After that, I realized we didn't update the database BLANK after the last security BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`credentials`

### --feedback--

This word refers to the username, password, or other information required to access a system.

---

`patch`

### --feedback--

This word refers to an update or fix applied to software or a system, often for security purposes.

# --explanation--

`Credentials` refers to information such as usernames, passwords, or keys that allow a user or system to access another system or resource. For example:

- `Please enter your credentials to log in to the server.` - meaning you should insert your information to access the server.

- `The credentials were incorrect, so the login failed.` - meaning the information you inserted is different from the one the system has in its database.

A `patch` is an update or fix applied to software or systems to correct issues, improve functionality, or enhance security. For example:

- `The developers released a patch to fix the bug.` - meaning they fixed the bug through an update to the system.

- `Make sure to apply the latest security patch to protect your system.` - meaning the last security update will be able to protect your system better.

Here, James explains that the issue was caused by forgetting to update the database `credentials` after applying a security `patch`.
