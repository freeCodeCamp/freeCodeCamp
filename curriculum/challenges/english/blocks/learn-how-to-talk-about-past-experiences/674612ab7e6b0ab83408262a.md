## --sentence--

`Thanks for BLANK it, James.`

## --blanks--

`handling`

### --feedback--

This word means taking care of or managing something. Use it in the `-ing` form.

# --explanation--

`Handle` in this context means to take care of or manage a task, issue, or responsibility. For example:

 `He handled the situation professionally.` - Meaning he took care of the problem as a professional.

When a verb follows a preposition, like `for`, it is used in the `-ing` form. For example: 

`She apologized for being late.` - The preposition `for` is followed by `being` in the -ing form.

In the sentence, Lisa is thanking James for managing or solving the problem.
