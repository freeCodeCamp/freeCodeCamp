# --explanation--

Affirmative sentences in the `Simple Past` follow specific rules:  

For the verb `to be`, the forms are `was` (singular) and `were` (plural). These forms are used without auxiliary verbs. For example: 

- `The project was successful.` - This means the project brought good results. 

- `They were happy with the results.` - this represents how `they` felt about the results of the project. 

Regular verbs in the Simple Past are formed by adding `-ed` to the base verb. For example: 

- `I worked on the project yesterday.` - You add `-ed` to the base form of the verb `work` to say that the action happened in a moment in the past.
