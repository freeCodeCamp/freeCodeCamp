`BLANK it stressful though?`

## --blanks--

`Wasn't`

### --feedback--

This is singular form of the verb `to be` in the Simple Past, but in the negative form. Do not forget to capitalize it.

# --explanation--

In negative questions with the verb `to be` in the Simple Past, use the structure **Wasn't/Weren't + subject + complement?**  

This structure is often used to confirm something or to express surprise or doubt. For example:  

- `Wasn't she at the meeting yesterday?` - You are not only asking about her being at the meeting, you are trying to confirm it because you think she was.

- `Weren't they informed about the changes?` - You are trying to confirm if they were informed or not.

In Lisa's question, `Wasn't it stressful though?`, she is asking James to confirm if the situation was stressful, possibly expecting that it might have been.
