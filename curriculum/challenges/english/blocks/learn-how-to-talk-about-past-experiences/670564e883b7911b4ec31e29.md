# --explanation--

The phrase `Great job` is used to praise or compliment someone for their effort or achievement. It expresses appreciation and acknowledgment of their success. For example:  

`You fixed the bug in record time. Great job!` - meaning you think it is great that the other person fixed the bug so fast.

Lisa's use of `Great job` in the dialogue reflects her recognition of James's effort in solving the problem and getting the app working again.
