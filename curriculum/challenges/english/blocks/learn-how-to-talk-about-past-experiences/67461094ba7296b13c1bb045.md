# --explanation--

`Absolutely` is used to express complete agreement or certainty. For example: 

Person 1: `Do you think this solution will work?`

Person 2: `Absolutely!` - Meaning that you are entirely confident and supportive of the solution.

In this dialog, Lisa, thus, is showing James she fully agrees with what he said.
