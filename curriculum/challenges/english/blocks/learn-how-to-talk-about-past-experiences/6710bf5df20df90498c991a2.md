# --explanation--

The `Past Continuous` tense often emphasizes the duration or background of an action in the past. It is used to describe an action that was ongoing at a specific time in the past. The structure is: **`was`/`were` + verb ending in `-ing`**. 

In Jake's sentence, `I was reviewing` shows that the action of reviewing was in progress yesterday. Another example: 

`She was testing the new feature when the system crashed.` - Here, the crashing of the system happened in the middle of her action of testing the new feature - the test was a longer ongoing action.
