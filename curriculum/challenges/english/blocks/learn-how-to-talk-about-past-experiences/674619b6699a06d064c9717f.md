`Something important came up during the meeting, and we had to address it immediately.` - Meaning something occurred during the meeting that needed immediate attention.  

`Debugging` refers to the process of identifying and resolving errors or issues in code. For example:

Lisa's question asks if any other unexpected issues could be seen during the process of fixing code errors.
