# --explanation--

The negative form of the verb `to be` in the `Simple Past` tense is `was not` or `wasn't` for singular subjects, and `were not` or `weren't` for plural subjects. It is used to describe something that did not happen or was not true. For example:  

- Singular: `The code wasn't running as expected.` - An issue was happening with the code.

- Plural: `The changes weren't implemented correctly.` - Errors in the implementation caused the bugs.

In James's sentence, he uses `wasn't` to explain that the system was failing to connect to the database. Negative sentences with `wasn't` or `weren't` indicate what did not occur or work as you might expect.
