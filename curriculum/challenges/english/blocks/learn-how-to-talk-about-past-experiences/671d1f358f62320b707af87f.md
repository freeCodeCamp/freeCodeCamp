`Lessons Learned from a Security Challenge`
`By Linda`
`October 26, 2024`

`Last week, our team had to work overtime. We found a serious security problem in our design project. Jake, who handles security, worked late to fix it while the rest of the team waited to continue. It wasn't easy, but we learned a lot.`

`We now know that we need to check for security issues while working on design updates, not after. This experience taught us how important it is to stay on top of things and not fall behind.`
