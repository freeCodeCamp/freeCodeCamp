# --explanation--

`Green light` in this context means approval or permission to start or continue an activity. It is often used figuratively to represent a signal to proceed. For example: 

`The manager gave the green light to launch the new product.` - Meaning the manager authorized the launch. 

In this sentence, Jake explains that the team was waiting for his permission to resume their work while he was resolving an issue.
