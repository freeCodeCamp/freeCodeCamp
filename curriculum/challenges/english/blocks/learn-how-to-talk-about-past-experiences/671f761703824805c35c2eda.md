# --explanation--

The phrase created by using `get` followed by an adjective describes a change of state or becoming a certain way. For example:

- `They always get excited when a new Python update is released.` - `Get excited` means to become enthusiastic or thrilled. This means they are always filled with enthusiasm when a new Python update comes up.

- `He got tired after working on the project all night.` - This means he wasn't tired before, but he is tired now, after a whole night of working on the project. 

In Maria's sentence, she is asking if Brian remembers the enthusiasm they used to feel about new technologies while working together.
