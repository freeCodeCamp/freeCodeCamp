You're likely already familiar with some of the basic shortcuts, which are inherited from your operating system. Shortcuts like `Ctrl + S` to save, `Ctrl + C` to copy, and `Ctrl + V` to paste all work in VS Code.

But there's a few that are application specific and can still level up your productivity. It's worth noting that some of these shortcuts may differ by operating system.

For example, `Shift + Alt + F` will run your configured formatter (such as prettier, for a JavaScript project) on the currently opened file.

Or `Ctrl + Shift + F` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + F` (Mac), to search the text contents of all the files in your workspace. Then `Ctrl + Shift + H` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + H` (Mac), if you want to run a find-and-replace.

If you need to remove a line, `Ctrl + Shift + K` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + K` (Mac), will delete it.

Need some extra room for all your code? `Ctrl + B` (Windows), or `Cmd + B` (Mac), will hide the sidebar - which has the file list and extensions menu.

Or maybe you just can't see your code? `Ctrl + plus` (Windows), or `Cmd + plus` (Mac), will increase the scaling of the editor, and `Ctrl + minus` (Windows), or `Cmd + minus` (Mac), will decrease it.

Another helpful feature in VS Code is multi-line editing, which allows you to make changes across several lines at once. For example, you can place multiple cursors by using `Ctrl + Alt + down` and `Ctrl + Alt + up` (Windows/Linux), or `Option + Command + down` and `Option + Command + up` (Mac), to extend the cursor to consecutive lines. You can also press and hold `Alt` (Windows/Linux) or `Option` (Mac) and click to add cursors on separate lines wherever you need them. Once the cursors are placed, anything you type or delete will apply to all those locations simultaneously — which can save a lot of time when working with repetitive code.

Finally, if you forget any of these shortcuts, you always have `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows), or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac), which opens the command palette for you to select whatever you may need.

With this knowledge, and maybe a little practice, you are well on your way to becoming a VS Code power user.
