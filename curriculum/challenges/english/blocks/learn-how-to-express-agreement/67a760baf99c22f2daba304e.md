# --instructions--

This task doesn't have audio. Read the question below and select the correct answer.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence uses `by the way` correctly?

## --answers--

`We are focusing on the front end, by the way, the back end will be handled separately.`

### --feedback--

`By the way` should be used to introduce a new, related topic.

---

`I will finish the report, by the way, before the deadline.`

### --feedback--

This usage feels awkward. `By the way` should introduce a different or unrelated topic, not just add more details.

---

`We need to finish the design by Friday. By the way, have you updated the documentation?`

---

`The meeting is at 10 AM, by the way, I'll send the agenda shortly.`

### --feedback--

`By the way` should introduce a new topic, but here, it's used to add additional details in a way that feels out of place.

# --explanation--  

`By the way` is used to introduce a new topic that is somewhat related but not directly connected to the previous statement. For example: 

`We need to finish the design by Friday. By the way, have you updated the documentation?` â€“ The second sentence shifts to a different but relevant topic in the conversation.  

Incorrect uses often try to connect ideas too closely or add extra details instead of introducing a new topic. The correct answer shows how `by the way` smoothly transitions to a different point in a natural way.
