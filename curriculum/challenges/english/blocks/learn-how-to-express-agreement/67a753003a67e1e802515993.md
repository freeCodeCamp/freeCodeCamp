`Collaborating` means working with others to achieve a common goal. It is often used in teamwork or project-based work. For example:

`The designers and developers are collaborating to improve the user experience.` – This means they are working together to make the interface more user-friendly. 

`Implement` means to put a plan or decision into action. For example:

`The team will implement a new authentication system next month.` – This means they will set up and start using a new way for users to log in.

`Front-end design` refers to the part of a website or app that users interact with directly. For example:
  
`The front-end design of the app was updated to make it more modern and intuitive.` – This means the visual and interactive elements were changed to improve the user experience.
