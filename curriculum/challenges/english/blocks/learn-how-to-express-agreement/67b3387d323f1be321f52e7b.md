`Overview`

`The goal was to improve the performance of our app by speeding up the database queries. This change will help the app run faster and more efficiently.`

`Actions Taken`

`- Code Optimization: I reviewed the code that handles the database queries and optimized it to reduce delays. This ensures faster data retrieval and overall better performance.`

`- Comments Added: To make the code easier to understand, I added comments explaining the logic behind the changes. It will help the team when reviewing the code and when we need to make changes later on.`

`- Testing: I ran a series of tests to verify that the changes worked as expected. This testing process also helps us catch problems early, ensuring that the app remains stable.`
