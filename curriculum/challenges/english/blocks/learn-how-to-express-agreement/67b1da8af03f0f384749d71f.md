`That's great` is a phrase used to express approval or happiness about something. It means that something is very positive or good. For example:

`That's great that you finished your task ahead of schedule.` - This means the speaker is happy or impressed with the accomplishment.

`Comments` in coding are notes written by the programmer to explain sections of the code. They help others (or the programmer in the future) understand what the code is doing. For example:

`The comments in the function explained how the algorithm worked step-by-step.` - This means the comments helped clarify the purpose of each part of the code.
