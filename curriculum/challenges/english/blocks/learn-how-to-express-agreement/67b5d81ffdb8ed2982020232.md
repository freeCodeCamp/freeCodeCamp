# --explanation--  

To find the correct answer, listen for key parts of Jim’s request:  

`The login process seems a bit lengthy` – This tells you he thinks the process takes too long.  

`It could be quicker, especially for returning users` – This makes it clear that he is focused on improving speed for people who have already logged in before.  

Notice how Jim keeps the conversation open and positive:

`Great, that would be helpful.` – He starts with appreciation before bringing up a concern.  

`Any thoughts on that?` – Instead of demanding a fix, he invites discussion.  

Jim is suggesting an improvement, not insisting on a change. The correct answer focuses on making the login process quicker, especially for returning users.
