<!-- (audio) Tom: How long are our workdays?
Anna: We typically finish at about 5, but that depends on project deadlines. -->

# --description--

To `depend on` shows that something can change when another factor influences it. It's a common way to explain that the result is not always the same and may vary. For example:

`Our trip depends on the weather.` - This means the plan can change if the weather is bad.

In the dialogue, the usual ending time is 5 o'clock, but if there is an important project deadline, the team might need to stay longer. 

# --questions--

Deadlines are not important for project completion.
