<!-- (audio) James: If you see any security breaches or incidents, you have to report them immediately. -->

# --description--

A `security breach` is when someone gets unauthorized access to a system or data. This can be a big problem in workplaces, especially when it involves private information. For example:

`A security breach occurred when an outsider accessed confidential files.` - This means there was a problem with security because someone from outside got into private files.
