<!-- (audio) James: Reporting helps us address issues effectively. -->

# --description--

To `report` something means to give information about an event, problem, or situation to the right person or authority. At work, this often means telling a manager, HR, or the security team about an issue so it can be solved. For example:

`I reported the broken printer to the IT department.` - This means the person told IT about the problem so they could fix it.

Reporting is important because it makes sure problems are not ignored and can be handled effectively.
