# --description--

`Security sweeps` are detailed inspections or searches conducted in an area or building, usually for safety and security purposes. They involve checking for any potential risks, unauthorized access, or dangerous items. For example:

`Security officers perform security sweeps to find any hidden dangers.` - This means security officers carefully check the area to see if there are any dangerous things that are not easy to see.
