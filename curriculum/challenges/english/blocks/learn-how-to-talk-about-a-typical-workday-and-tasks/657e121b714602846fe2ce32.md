# --description--

The `present simple` tense is used to talk about regular actions or routines.

Remember, to form the `present simple`, you use the base verb for `I`, `you`, `we`, `they` (`I code`, `they test`), and you add `-s` or `-es` for `he`, `she`, `it` (`he codes`, `she tests`).

In a work context, describing daily tasks is typically done using the `present simple` tense, as these are habitual actions.
