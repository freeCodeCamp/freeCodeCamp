# --description--

`AM` and `PM` are used to tell time during the day. `AM` means the time from midnight to noon (for example, `8:00 AM` is in the morning). `PM` means the time from noon to midnight (for example, `6:00 PM` is in the evening).

In English, the day is divided into two periods using `AM` and `PM`. 
`AM` stands for `Ante Meridiem`, which is Latin for `before midday`. It refers to the time from midnight (`12:00 AM`) to noon (`12:00 PM`). So, when you say `9:00 AM`, it means 9 in the morning.

`PM` stands for `Post Meridiem`, which is Latin for `after midday`. It refers to the time from noon (`12:00 PM`) to just before midnight (`11:59 PM`). So, when we say `3:00 PM`, it means 3 in the afternoon.
