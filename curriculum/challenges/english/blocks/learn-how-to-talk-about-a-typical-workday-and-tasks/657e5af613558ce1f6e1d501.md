<!-- (audio) Linda: Do we have to report every security incident? -->

# --description--

A `security incident` is an event that may be harmful to the safety or security of a company or organization. For example, `A security incident like a stolen password needs to be reported immediately`.

Note on `harm` and `harmful`:

`Harm` means damage or injury to someone or something. It refers to causing a negative effect or putting someone or something at risk. For example:

`Touching hot surfaces can cause harm.` - This means that touching hot surfaces can lead to injury or damage.

`Harmful` is an adjective used to describe something that can cause harm. It means dangerous or risky in a way that could lead to damage or injury. For example:

`Smoking is harmful to health.` - This indicates that smoking can cause health problems or damage.

These terms are often used to discuss safety and risks, especially in contexts like health, security, and the environment.
