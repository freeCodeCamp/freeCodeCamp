# --description--

`Must` and `have to` express obligation. `Must` is often used for strong personal or internal obligations, while `have to` is more for external requirements or rules. For example:

- `I must finish this report because it's important to me.` - Here, the obligation comes from the speaker's own feeling or decision. The person chooses to make it important.

- `I have to finish this report by 5 PM because my boss said so.` - Here, the obligation comes from an external rule or authority. The boss sets the deadline, so it is not the speaker's personal choice.

This difference helps show whether the obligation is internal (from yourself) or external (from outside, like rules or instructions).
