<!-- (audio) Anna: Hi, Tom. Let me tell you what a regular day at our company normally looks like. We start at 9. The first thing to do is log in to your computer and check your emails. -->

# --description--

Understanding the order of activities in a work routine is important because it shows how the day is organized. 

`The first thing to do is...` is used to describe the very first action in a sequence of tasks. For example, if you are cooking, you might say, `The first thing to do is wash the vegetables`. This phrase helps make instructions and routines clear and easy to follow.
