<!-- (audio) Linda: Do we have to report every security incident? -->

# --description--

An `incident` is an event that happens unintentionally, but it may or may not cause damage, harm, or injury. For example:

`There was a small incident at the meeting, but it was quickly resolved.` - Here, `incident` refers to something unusual that didn't necessarily cause any harm.

A similar word is `accident`, which is an event that also happens unintentionally, but it always results in damage, injury, or harm. For example:

`She broke her arm in a skiing accident.` - Here, `accident` highlights that the injury happened unexpectedly and caused harm.

In short, every accident is an incident, but not every incident is an accident.
