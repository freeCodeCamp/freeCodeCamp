# --description--

Understanding what people are saying is important. 

`Weekdays` refer to Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. They usually use the preposition `on`. For example, `I work on weekdays` or `I work on Monday`.

`Weekend` refers to Saturday and Sunday. It can use either `on` or `at`. For example, `I relax on the weekend` or `I relax at the weekend`. Both are correct and mean the same thing.
