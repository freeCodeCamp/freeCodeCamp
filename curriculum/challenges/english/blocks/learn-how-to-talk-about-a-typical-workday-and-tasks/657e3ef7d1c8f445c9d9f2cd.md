<!-- (audio) Sophie: What a responsibility. What else do you do? -->

# --description--

Reacting to someone's statements in conversation often means showing that you understand their situation or feelings. `What a responsibility` is an example of this.

Even though it begins with the question word `what`, it is not a question but a statement. The structure `What a...` is often used to show strong feelings or recognition about something. For example:

- `What a surprise!` means you feel strongly surprised.

- `What a beautiful day!` means you are showing a strong positive reaction.

In the same way, `What a responsibility` shows that you recognize the importance and seriousness of someone's duties.
