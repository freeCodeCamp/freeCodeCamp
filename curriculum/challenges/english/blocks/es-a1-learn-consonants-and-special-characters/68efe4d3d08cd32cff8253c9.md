## The Spanish Alphabet

Now that you are familiar with the five vowels and their sounds in Spanish, you're ready to learn the Spanish alphabet. 

In this block, you will dive into the consonants and complete your journey through the alphabet (`abecedario` in Spanish).

The full Spanish alphabet consists of **27 letters**:

`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `i`, `j`, `k`, `l`, `m`, `n`, `ñ`, `o`, `p`, `q`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `x`, `y`, `z`.

These are their uppercase versions:

`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `I`, `J`, `K`, `L`, `M`, `N`, `Ñ`, `O`, `P`, `Q`, `R`, `S`, `T`, `U`, `V`, `W`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`.

As you can see, you already know five of these letters (the vowels!).

You might also notice a special letter that is unique to Spanish: the `ñ`, called `eñe`. This letter has a distinctive sound that you will learn in this block. You'll also explore and practice other letters with unique sounds.

Understanding each letter is essential for pronouncing and spelling them correctly in Spanish. By the end of this block, you will be able to identify and pronounce the entire Spanish alphabet.

Are you ready? Let's continue.
