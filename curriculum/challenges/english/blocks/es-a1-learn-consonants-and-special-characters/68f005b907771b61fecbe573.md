<!-- (Audio) Julieta: h -->

# --description--

The letter `h` is very interesting. It's called `hache`.

Believe it or not, this letter is always silent in Spanish!

Yes, that's right. In Spanish, it's never pronounced. It's part of the spelling but it doesn't affect the pronunciation at all.

For example, the word `hola` ("hello") sounds like `ola` ("wave"), as if the letter `h` was not even there because it's completely silent.

# --instructions--
