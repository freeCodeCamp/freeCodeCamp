<!-- (Audio) Julieta: h -->

# --description--

The letter `h` is very interesting. It's called `hache` (pronounced `ah-cheh`).

Believe it or not, this letter is always silent in Spanish!

Yes, that's right. Unlike English, where this letter makes a rough sound, in Spanish it's never pronounced. It's part of the spelling but it doesn't affect the pronounciation at all.

For example, the word `Hola` ("Hello") sounds like `ola`, as if the letter `h` was not even there because it's completely silent.
