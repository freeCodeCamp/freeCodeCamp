Making static content accessible can be relatively straightforward, but dynamic content can be more challenging. This is where WAI-ARIA comes in.

Let's look at what WAI-ARIA is, its purpose, how it works, and some examples.

WAI-ARIA stands for Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's a specification that enhances accessibility for dynamic content and UI (User Interface) components.

Note that WCAG and WAI-ARIA are not the same. WCAG provides general guidelines for web accessibility, while WAI-ARIA offers specific rules for making dynamic and interactive content accessible for users of assistive technologies.

So, the primary purpose of WAI-ARIA is to improve accessibility for dynamic content and UI components that do not have native HTML equivalents.

WAI-ARIA works by introducing a set of attributes you can add to HTML elements to provide additional semantic information. These attributes are categorized into roles, states, and properties.

ARIA role defines the purpose of an element within a website or web app. Here is an example of setting the role to `button` for a `div` element.

```html
<div role="button">Click Me</div>
```

By doing this you are indicating to assistive technology that the element is a button. Roles do not provide any functionality however. Merely giving this `div` a `role` of `button` will not make it act like a button. To make it look and behave like a button you would need to use CSS and JavaScript to get the desired result. It is always better to use the native `button` or `input` element with `type="button"` instead.

ARIA properties provide additional details about elements. For example, the `aria-labelledby` property lets you connect an element to a specific label:

```html
<h2 id="header-id">About freeCodeCamp</h2>
<button id="button-id" aria-labelledby="header-id button-id">Learn More</button>
```

This will make the elements understandable and navigable for users of assistive technologies.

To get the best out of WAI-ARIA, try to stick with native HTML whenever possible since it generally provides more accessibility out of the box.

Use WAI-ARIA only when HTML falls short, and donâ€™t forget to test with assistive technologies like screen readers, or have people with disabilities test your work. Also, make sure your WAI-ARIA states and properties update with the content in real time. Avoid overusing ARIA as it can be confusing many times.
