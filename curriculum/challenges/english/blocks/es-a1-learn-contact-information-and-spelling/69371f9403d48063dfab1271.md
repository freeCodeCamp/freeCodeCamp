# --explanation--

The phrase `el tuyo` is a **possessive pronoun** in Spanish that means "yours" (referring to something masculine, like `número`). It's often used when the noun has already been mentioned or is understood from the context. For example:

- `Mi número es +57 313 445 9280. ¿Y el tuyo?` – My number is +57 313 445 9280. And yours?

- `Este es mi libro. ¿Dónde está el tuyo?` – This is my book. Where’s yours?
