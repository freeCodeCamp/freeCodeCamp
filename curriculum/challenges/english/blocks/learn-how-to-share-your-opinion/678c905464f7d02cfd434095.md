`Automation` is the use of technology to perform tasks automatically without human intervention. For example:

`The company uses automation to schedule social media posts every day.` - It means using software tools to schedule posts without manual input each time.

`Data-driven` means making decisions based on data analysis. For example:

`The team made a data-driven decision to improve website performance based on user activity data.` - It indicates that the decision was based on actual data about user behavior, rather than assumptions or guesses.
