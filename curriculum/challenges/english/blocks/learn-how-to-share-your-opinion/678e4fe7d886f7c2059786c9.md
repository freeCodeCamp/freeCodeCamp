## --sentence--

`BLANK, but wouldn't we need something that can easily detect vulnerabilities?`

## --blanks--

`That's a good reason`

### --feedback--

This phrase has four words: a contraction, an article, an adjective, and a noun. Think about a common way to agree with someone while recognizing their argument.  

# --explanation--

`That's a good reason` is a way of showing agreement with someone's explanation or justification. It acknowledges that the other person's point is valid or reasonable before continuing with another thought or question. For example:

When Sarah says the team should choose a tool because it is fast and reliable, Tom might say `That's a good reason, but we need to consider the cost`. - In this case, Tom agrees with Sarah's point, but then raises another point about the cost. This shows that he values her opinion but wants to make sure all aspects are considered.
