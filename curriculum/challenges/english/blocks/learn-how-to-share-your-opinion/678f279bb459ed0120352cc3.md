# --explanation--

`Maybe` is often used when you're not sure about something or when you're considering a possibility. For example:

`Maybe we should try using Azure for this project.` - This means that Azure is one option, but it is still uncertain if it will be the final choice.

`Azure` is the cloud platform from Microsoft, providing tools for building, deploying, and managing applications. For example:

`Our company uses Azure for hosting our servers and managing databases.` - This means the company uses Microsoft's cloud platform for server and database management.

`Integrates` means to combine or allow two or more things to work together effectively. For example:

`Our CRM software integrates with Azure to manage customer data more efficiently.` - This means the CRM system works seamlessly with Azure to store and process customer information.
