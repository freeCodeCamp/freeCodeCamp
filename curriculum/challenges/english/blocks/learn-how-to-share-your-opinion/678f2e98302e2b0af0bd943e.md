`Guess` is used when you're uncertain about something, but you still form an opinion or make a suggestion. For example:

`I guess we could try a different approach.` - This means you're not completely sure, but you think trying a different approach is a good idea.

`Consider` means to think carefully about something, often before making a decision. For example:

`We need to consider all the options before choosing a solution.` - This means you need to think carefully about all possible solutions before making a final choice.
