# --explanation--

Let's look at what helps you find the correct answer in the audio:  

`I think` tells you that Linda is sharing her opinion.  

`The best language for beginners` is the key phrase. The word `best` suggests a positive opinion, and `for beginners` tells you she is talking about people new to programming.
