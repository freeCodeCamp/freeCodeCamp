# --explanation--

When asked why you chose Python as your first language, it's best to highlight Python's specific advantages.

Python is known for being beginner-friendly, with a simple syntax that is easy to read and learn. Additionally, Python has a great collection of libraries and frameworks, which makes it practical choice for beginners.

On the other hand, saying, `I've always wanted to be a developer` does not explain why you chose Python. It focuses on the desire to become a developer but lacks any Python-specific reasoning.
