# --explanation--

Let's break down how Tom compares JavaScript and Python:  

`I'm not a fan of Python's syntax—it feels a bit rigid.` - Here, Tom expresses that he doesn't like Python's syntax because it feels too strict or inflexible. This shows his dissatisfaction with Python.  

`I find JavaScript more flexible.` - Tom contrasts Python with JavaScript by describing JavaScript as `more flexible`, meaning it's easier to work with or adapt in different situations.  

`And it's the go-to language for front-end development.` - Tom highlights JavaScript's primary use: it's the main language for creating front-end applications, showing his preference for it in this area.  

When comparing the two, Tom finds JavaScript more versatile and better suited for front-end development, while he finds Python less flexible due to its rigid syntax.
