Jake really wants the team to use Visual Studio Code, so he tried to persuade them with this email:

`Visual Studio Code is a popular choice for development because it is lightweight and customizable. It offers many extensions to meet the needs of different teams and comes with built-in security features to protect the codebase. Since it's flexible, it works well for various types of projects.`

`The tool makes teamwork easier by supporting version control, so developers can track changes to the code. It also helps with code refactoring, improving the structure of the code when needed. It's useful for large teams working on complex projects.`

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, look for where the text describes why Visual Studio Code is flexible.  

Pay attention to the sentence: `Visual Studio Code is a popular choice for development because it is lightweight and customizable.`  

The word `customizable` means it can be adjusted to meet different needs, which is what makes it flexible.  

Other features, like debugging tools and security features, are mentioned in the text, but they are not the reason why Visual Studio Code is described as flexible. The key idea is that it can be customized, which allows it to work for various types of projects.
