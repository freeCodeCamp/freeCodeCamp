# --explanation--

Think about what makes `Visual Studio Code` adaptable for different teams.  

Jake mentions `a large selection of extensions` — how might this help teams with different needs?  

He also says it's `customizable` — why would customization be important for various workflows?  

By focusing on these key points, you can see that Jake values `extensions` and `customizability` because they allow teams to adjust the tool to fit their specific needs.
