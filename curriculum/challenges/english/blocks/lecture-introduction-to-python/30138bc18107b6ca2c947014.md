# --description--

Python uses indentation to define code blocks (instead of braces or explicit `end` keywords). A header line that introduces a block (for example `if`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `try`, `except`, `else`, `elif`, `finally`, or `with`) **ends with a colon (`:`)**; the indented lines that follow form the block (suite). A change in indentation level begins or ends a block, so consistent indentation is required for correct program structure and execution. Mixing tabs and spaces can produce `TabError` / `IndentationError`; the official Python style guide (PEP 8) **recommends using 4 spaces per indentation level and prefers spaces over tabs**. One-line blocks are syntactically allowed (e.g. `if cond: do_something()`), but PEP 8 recommends using multiline indented suites for readability.

For example, the body of an `if` statement, loop, or function is defined by the indentation level. This makes code visually clean, but it also means indentation is required for Python to understand your program.

The Python community recommends using four spaces per indentation level, as described in PEP 8. Mixing tabs and spaces can cause confusing errors, so it is best to stick with spaces consistently.
