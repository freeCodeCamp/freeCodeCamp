# --description--

Functions are reusable pieces of code that run when you call them. Many programming languages come with built-in functions that make it easier to get started. Python is no exception, and we've already covered some built-in functions like `print()` in previous lessons.

Another helpful built-in function is `input()`, which lets you prompt the user for input:

```python
name = input('What is your name?') # User types "Kolade" and presses Enter  
print('Hello', name) # Output: Hello Kolade
```

On the other hand, `int()` converts a number, boolean, and a numeric string into an integer:

```python
print(int(3.14)) # 3
print(int('42')) # 42
print(int(True)) # 1
print(int(False)) # 0 
```

You can also write your own custom functions. To do that, you use the `def` keyword, followed by the name you want to give your function, a pair of parentheses, and a colon. Then on a new line, you write the code your function should run. The code the function runs is also referred to as the function's body.

Here's an example of a custom function named `hello` that prints the string `Hello World` to the terminal:

```python
def hello():
    print('Hello World')
```

To run the function, you need to call it with its name followed by a pair of parentheses:

```python
hello() # Hello World
```

Notice the indentation before `print('Hello World')`. The level of indentation defines a "code block" in Python, which is a group of statements that belong together.

While other programming languages use characters like curly braces to define code blocks, and just use indentation for readability, in Python, code blocks are determined by indentation.

Though you can use either two or four spaces to determine each level of indentation, the Python style guide recommends using four spaces.

Blocks are also found in loops and conditionals, which you'll learn about in future lessons.

Here's another simple function that prints the sum of two numbers to the terminal:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)
```

You can see that our function, `calculate_sum`, has `a` and `b` in its parentheses, separated by a comma. Those are called parameters. Think of parameters as placeholder variables that act as "slots" for the values you pass into functions when you call them.

To use the parameters, you have to pass in "arguments". Arguments are the values you pass to a function when you call it.

Here's how to call the `calculate_sum` function to sum together the numbers `3` and `1`:

```python
calculate_sum(3, 1) # 4
```

If you call the function without the correct number of arguments, you'll get a `TypeError`:

```python
calculate_sum()

# TypeError: calculate_sum() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'a' and 'b'
```

Functions also use a special `return` keyword to exit the function and return a value. If you don't explicitly use `return`, Python will return `None` by default.

Here's an example:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    print(a + b)

my_sum = calculate_sum(3, 1) # 4
print(my_sum) # None
```

You can see that the `calculate_sum` function prints the sum of `a` and `b`, but it doesn't return anything explicitly. So when we assign its result to `my_sum`, the value is actually `None`. To fix that, you can use the `return` keyword to send back the result:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b

my_sum = calculate_sum(3, 1)
print(my_sum) # 4
```

Now, `calculate_sum` returns the sum of `a` and `b`, which gets stored in `my_sum`.

Argument

### --feedback--

It's defined in the function declaration, not when calling it.

Return value

### --feedback--

### --feedback--

While parameters are variables, the specific term for placeholder variables in function definitions is different.

## --text--

What is the difference between parameters and arguments in Python functions?

## --answers--

Parameters are values passed to a function, arguments are variables inside the function.

### --feedback--

It's actually the other way around - parameters are in the function definition, arguments are passed when calling.

---

Parameters are defined in the function declaration, arguments are the values passed when calling the function.

---

Arguments are the function name, parameters are the values passed to it.

### --feedback--

Parameters are part of the function definition, not the values passed to it.

---

There is no difference, they mean the same thing.

### --feedback--

These terms have distinct meanings in Python function definitions and calls.
