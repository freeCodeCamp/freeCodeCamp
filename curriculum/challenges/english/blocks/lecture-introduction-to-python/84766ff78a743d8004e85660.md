# --description--

Python gives you two common ways to run your code: the REPL and script files.

A <dfn>REPL</dfn> (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop) is the interactive Python shell. You type a line of code, Python evaluates it, and it prints the result right away. You can start the REPL by running `python` or `python3` in your terminal. The REPL is great for quick experiments and checking how a function behaves.

For longer programs, you will typically write code in a file with a `.py` extension. You can run a script by passing the file name to the Python command, like `python hello.py` or `python3 hello.py`. Python will execute each line in the file from top to bottom.

You can mix these workflows. Use the REPL to test a small idea, then move that code into a script when you are ready to build something larger.
