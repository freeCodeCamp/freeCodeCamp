# --description--

Python is a dynamically-typed language like JavaScript, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare types for variables. The language knows what data type a variable is based on what you assign to it.

Here are some examples:

```python
name = 'John Doe' # Python knows this is a string
age = 25 # Python knows this is an integer
```

This is in contrast to some statically-typed languages like C#, Java, and C++, where you have to declare types with variables, like this:

```csharp
string name = 'John Doe'
int age = 25
```

The dynamic-typing nature of Python makes coding really fast and more flexible, but it can lead to unexpected bugs because type errors are detected only when a program runs, not when the program compiles.

Here are the most common data types you'll use in Python:

- Integer: A whole number without decimals, for example, `10` or `-5`.

```python
my_integer_var = 10
print('Integer:', my_integer_var) # Integer: 10
```

- Float: A number with a decimal point, like `4.41` or `-0.4`.

```python
my_float_var = 4.50
print('Float:', my_float_var) # Float: 4.5
```

- Complex: A number with a real and imaginary part, like `6 + 7j`.

```python
my_complex_var = 3 + 4j
print('Complex:', my_complex_var) # Complex: (3+4j)
```

- String: A sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotation marks like `'Hello world!'`.

```python
my_string_var = 'hello'
print('String:', my_string_var) # String: hello
```

- Boolean: A true or false type, written as `True` or `False`.

```python
my_boolean_var = True
print('Boolean:', my_boolean_var) # Boolean: True
```

- Set: An unordered collection of unique elements, like `{4, 2, 0}`.
 
```python
my_set_var = {7, 5, 8}
print('Set:', my_set_var) # Set: {7, 5, 8}
```

- Dictionary: A collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, like `{'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 28}`. 

```python
my_dictionary_var = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
print('Dictionary:', my_dictionary_var) # Dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
```

- Tuple: An immutable ordered collection, enclosed in brackets, like `(7, 8, 4)`.

```python
my_tuple_var = (7, 5, 8)
print('Tuple:', my_tuple_var) # Tuple: (7, 5, 8)
```

- Range: A sequence of numbers, often used in loops, for example, `range(5)`.

```python
my_range_var = range(5)
print(my_range_var) # range(0, 5)
```

- List: An ordered collection of elements that supports different data types.
    
```python
my_list = [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]
print(my_list) # [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]
```

- None: A special value that represents the absence of a value.

```python
my_none_var = None
print('None:', my_none_var) # None: None
```

Many other programming languages group data types broadly as either primitive or reference types. Primitive types are simple and immutable, meaning they can't be changed once declared. Reference types can hold multiple values, and are either mutable or immutable. But Python doesn't draw a hard line between those two groups. Instead, all data gets treated as objects, and some objects are immutable while others are mutable.

Immutable data types can't be modified or altered once they're declared. You can point their variables at something new, which is called reassignment, but you can't change the original object itself by adding, removing, or replacing any of its elements. Examples of immutable data types in Python are string, integer, float, boolean, tuple, and range.

Here's an example showing that, while you can reassign a different string to a variable, direct modification of a string isn't allowed because strings are immutable:

```python
greeting = 'hi'
greeting = 'hello'
print(greeting) # hello

greeting[0] = 'H' # TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

On the other hand, you can change mutable types without giving them a new name. You can add, remove, or update items right where they live. Examples are a list and a dictionary.

Here's an example of updating an element in a list:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3]
nums[0] = 4

print(nums) # [4, 2, 3]
```

To get the data type of a variable, you can use the `type()` function:

```python
my_var_1 = 'Hello world'
my_var_2 = 21

print(type(my_var_1)) # <class 'str'>
print(type (my_var_2)) # <class 'int'>
```

And here's are all the data types covered in this lesson, along with their types in the terminal:

```python
my_integer_var = 10
print('Integer:', my_integer_var, '| Type:', type(my_integer_var))  # Integer: 10 | Type: <class 'int'>

my_float_var = 4.50
print('Float:', my_float_var, '| Type:', type(my_float_var))  # Float: 4.5 | Type: <class 'float'>

my_complex_var = 3 + 4j
print('Complex:', my_complex_var, '| Type:', type(my_complex_var))  # Complex: (3+4j) | Type: <class 'complex'>

my_string_var = 'hello'
print('String:', my_string_var, '| Type:', type(my_string_var))  # String: hello | Type: <class 'str'>

my_boolean_var = True
print('Boolean:', my_boolean_var, '| Type:', type(my_boolean_var))  # Boolean: True | Type: <class 'bool'>

my_set_var = {7, 5, 8}
print('Set:', my_set_var, '| Type:', type(my_set_var))  # Set: {7, 5, 8} | Type: <class 'set'>

my_dictionary_var = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
print('Dictionary:', my_dictionary_var, '| Type:', type(my_dictionary_var))  # Dictionary: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25} | Type: <class 'dict'>

my_tuple_var = (7, 5, 8)
print('Tuple:', my_tuple_var, '| Type:', type(my_tuple_var))  # Tuple: (7, 5, 8) | Type: <class 'tuple'>

my_range_var = range(5)
print('Range:', list(my_range_var), '| Type:', type(my_range_var))  # Range: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] | Type: <class 'range'>

my_list = [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True]
print('List:', list(my_list), '| Type:', type(my_list)) # List: [22, 'Hello world', 3.14, True] | Type: <class 'list'>

my_none_var = None
print('None:', my_none_var, '| Type:', type(my_none_var))  # None: None | Type: <class 'NoneType'>
```

Another way to check the type of a variable is to use the built-in `isinstance()` function, which checks if a variable matches a specific data type.

`isinstance()` takes in an object and the type you want to check it against, then returns a boolean. Here are some examples:

```python
isinstance('Hello world', str) # True
isinstance(True, bool) # True
isinstance(42, int) # True
isinstance('John Doe', int) # False
```

Although Python is dynamically typed, you can still add type hints. These are optional signals that tell other developers what the data type of a variable or function is expected to be. Here's a quick example for variable types:

```python
user_name: str = 'John Doe'
user_age: int = 24
```

Here's another example showing hints for function parameters and a return type:

```python
def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    return f'Hello, {name}, age {age}.'
```

And here's a combination of the two:

```python
def greet(name: str, age: int) -> str:
    return f'Hello, {name}, age {age}.'

user_name: str = 'John Doe'
user_age: int = 24

print(greet(user_name, user_age)) # Hello, John Doe, age 24.
```

Note that, unlike TypeScript which enforces types at compile time, Python just uses these hints for static analysis, documentation, and editor support, **not** for enforcing types during runtime. This can help developers catch bugs early and improve code readability, especially in large projects.
