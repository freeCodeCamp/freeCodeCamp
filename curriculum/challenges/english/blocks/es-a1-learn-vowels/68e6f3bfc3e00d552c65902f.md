## Vowels in Spanish

Great work so far! Now you are ready to start learning the vowels in Spanish.

Vowels are sounds made with an open mouth, without blocking the airflow. 

In Spanish, there are five vowels: **`a`**, **`e`**, **`i`**, **`o`**, **`u`**.

These are the vowels in uppercase: **`A`**, **`E`**, **`I`**, **`O`**, **`U`**.

Let's have a quick overview of their sounds in Spanish:

- The vowel `a` sounds like the letter "a" in "father".

- The vowel `e` sounds like the letter "e" in "get".

- The vowel `i` sounds like the letters "ee" in "see".

- The vowel `o` sounds like the letter "o" in "got".

- The vowel `u` sounds like the letters "oo" in "moon".

You'll listen to them in just a moment when you go to the next task. 

Unlike English, where vowels can have different sounds, in Spanish, vowels are pronounced consistently, always using the same sounds.

That is great because they are easy to learn and practice. Every time you see a vowel in a Spanish word, you'll know that it will be pronounced exactly the same as you learned.

Now it's time to start training your ear. The coming exercises will help you practice how to identify their sounds, how to pronounce them, and how to write them.

Are you ready? Let's continue.
