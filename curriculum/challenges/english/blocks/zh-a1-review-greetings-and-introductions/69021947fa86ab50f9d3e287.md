## Three Types of Greetings

In Chinese, there are different ways to say "hello" depending on who you're greeting:

- `你好 (nǐ hǎo)` means "hello" and is used in casual situations, such as with friends and peers.

- `您好 (nín hǎo)` is the polite, respectful way to say "hello", such as when greeting elders, teachers, or in professional settings.

- `你们好 (nǐ men hǎo)` means "hello everyone" and is used when greeting a group of people.

## Using `我是 (wǒ shì)` to Introduce Yourself

The phrase `我是 (wǒ shì)` is the most basic way to describe who you are, like your name, nationality, and profession. Examples:
