## Pinyin

### Tone Sandhi

When two third-tone syllables appear together, the first syllable becomes second tone and the second syllable stays third tone. You write the original tones, but pronounce them differently.

**Rule**: 3rd Tone + 3rd Tone → 2nd Tone + 3rd Tone. For example:

`你好 (nǐ hǎo)` is pronounced as `ní hǎo`.

### Neutral Tone

The neutral tone is the fifth tone in Chinese, marked by no tone mark. It's pronounced with a light and short sound. For example, in `你们 (nǐ men)`, the syllable `men` is in neutral tone.
