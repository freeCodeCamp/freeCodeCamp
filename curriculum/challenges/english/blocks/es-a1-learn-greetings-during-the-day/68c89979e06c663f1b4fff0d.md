<!-- (Audio) Camila: Adiós. Hasta pronto. -->

# --description--

As you may have noticed, there are different ways to say goodbye in Spanish. Each one has a slightly different meaning, depending on how soon you expect to see the person again.

Here are three common options:

| Expression       | Meaning             | When to Use                              |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Adiós`          | Goodbye              | More general or when you might not see the person soon. |
| `Hasta luego`    | See you later        | When you expect to see the person again, but not immediately. |
| `Hasta pronto`   | See you soon         | When you expect to see the person again very soon. |

These expressions can be used alone or combined naturally in conversation, like Camila is using them right now.

`Hasta pronto` means "See you soon" and is used when you expect to see the person again soon. For example:  

`Adiós. Hasta pronto.` – Goodbye. See you soon.
