# --explanation--

`Hasta mañana` means "See you tomorrow" in Spanish. It's used when you expect to see the person the next day.  

`Hasta` means "until", and `mañana` means "tomorrow", so the phrase literally means "until tomorrow". For example:  

`Hasta mañana, Rafael.` – See you tomorrow, Rafael.
