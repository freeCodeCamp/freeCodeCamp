<!-- (Audio) Camila: Soy Camila -->

# --description--

You've learned how to introduce yourself using `me llamo`. Another common way is by using the verb `soy`, like this:

`Soy` + your name

In Spanish, you usually don’t need to include the subject pronoun, like `Yo`. Since verbs are conjugated, you can tell who is speaking from the verb itself. So instead of saying `Yo soy Marta`, you can simply say:

`Soy Marta` – I'm Marta.

This is a very natural and common way to introduce yourself.

# --explanation--

`Soy Camila` means "I am Camila" in Spanish.  

`Soy` means "I am", and it's often used to introduce your name without needing to say `yo`. For example:  

`Soy Daniel.` – I am Daniel.
