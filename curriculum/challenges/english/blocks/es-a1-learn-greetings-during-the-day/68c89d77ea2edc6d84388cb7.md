# --explanation--

`Hasta mañana` and `Chao` are friendly ways to say goodbye in Spanish.

`Hasta mañana` means "See you tomorrow". It's used when you expect to see the person the next day.

`Chao` is an informal version of "goodbye" used in some Spanish-speaking countries. It's similar to "bye". For example:

`Hasta mañana. Chao.` – See you tomorrow. Bye.

There are two common spellings of the word `chao`:

- `Chao` with `o` is more common in Spain, Chile, and Colombia.

- `Chau` with `u` is often used in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.
