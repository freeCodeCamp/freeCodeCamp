# --explanation--

`Buenas noches` is a greeting used at night.  

It translates to "Good evening" or "Good night", depending on the context.

In Spanish, you can use `Buenas noches` both when greeting someone in the evening **and** when greeting or saying goodbye at night. For example:  

- `Hola, buenas noches.` – Hello, good evening.

- `Adiós, buenas noches.` – Goodbye, good night.
