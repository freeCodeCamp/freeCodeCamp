# --explanation--

Camila is now using the same structure she used to say her name. But this time, to tell her profession. The structure looks like this:

`Soy` + profession

Again, you don't need to say the pronoun `yo` because the verb `soy` already tells you who is speaking.

`Soy analista` means "I am an analyst".

`Analista` is a neutral noun, so it's the same for both male and female speakers. For example:  

`Soy analista de datos.` – I am a data analyst.

This example sentence works for both male and female.
