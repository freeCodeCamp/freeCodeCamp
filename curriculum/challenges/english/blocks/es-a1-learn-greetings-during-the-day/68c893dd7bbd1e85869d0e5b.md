# --explanation--

`Hasta luego` and `Adiós` are two common ways to say goodbye in Spanish. You can use them **together** in natural conversation, especially to sound polite or friendly.

`Hasta luego` means "See you later" and it's used when you plan to see the person again.

`Adiós` means "Goodbye" and it's often more final, but still friendly. For example:  

`Hasta luego. Adiós.` – See you later. Goodbye.

Notice the accent mark on the `ó`. It's important for correct pronunciation and writing.
