# --description--

Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways.

For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:

$$\begin{align}
  & {2285}^2 + {20}^3 \\\\
  & {2223}^2 + {66}^3 \\\\
  & {1810}^2 + {125}^3 \\\\
  & {1197}^2 + {156}^3
\end{align}$$

Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.

# --hints--

`sumOfSquareAndCube()` should return `1004195061`.

```js
assert.strictEqual(sumOfSquareAndCube(), 1004195061);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function sumOfSquareAndCube() {

  return true;
}

sumOfSquareAndCube();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
