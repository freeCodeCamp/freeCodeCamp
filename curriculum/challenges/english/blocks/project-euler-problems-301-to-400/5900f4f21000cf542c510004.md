An unbiased single 4-sided die is thrown and its value, $T$, is noted.

$T$ unbiased 6-sided dice are thrown and their scores are added together. The sum, $C$, is noted.

$C$ unbiased 8-sided dice are thrown and their scores are added together. The sum, $O$, is noted.

$O$ unbiased 12-sided dice are thrown and their scores are added together. The sum, $D$, is noted.
