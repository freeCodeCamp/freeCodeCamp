## Special Characters

In Spanish, questions and exclamations are marked with opening and closing punctuation marks.

Unlike English, where only the closing question mark (`?`) or exclamation point (`!`) is used, in Spanish you must write an inverted question mark (`¿`) at the beginning of a question and an inverted exclamation point (`¡`) at the beginning of an exclamation.

For example:

- For a question, you would write `¿Cómo estás?` ("How are you?").

- For an exclamation, you would write `¡Gracias!` ("Thank you").

The opening punctuation marks are helpful to anticipate the tone and structure of the sentence from the start.
