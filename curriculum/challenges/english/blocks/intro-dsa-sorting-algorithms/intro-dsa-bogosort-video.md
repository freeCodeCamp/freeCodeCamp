In this video, you will learn how to work with the bogosort algorithm.

# --questions--

## --text--

How does the bogosort algorithm work?

## --answers--

It repeatedly swaps adjacent elements in a deterministic pattern until sorted.

---

It splits the list into halves, sorts each recursively, then merges them.

---

It randomly shuffles the list until it happens to be sorted.

---
