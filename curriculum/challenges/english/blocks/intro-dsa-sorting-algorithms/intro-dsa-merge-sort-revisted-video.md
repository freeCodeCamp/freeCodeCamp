# --description--

In this video, you will revisit the merge sort algorithm.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is a core difference between the merge sort and quicksort algorithms?

## --answers--

Merge sort swaps adjacent elements repeatedly until sorted.

---

Quicksort will partition the list around a pivot and recursively sort sublists, while merge sort splits the list in half and merges sorted halves.

---

Merge sort uses a hash table to count elements, whereas quicksort uses a deque to reorder elements.

---

Quicksort always uses a while loop to sort, while merge sort uses a for loop.
