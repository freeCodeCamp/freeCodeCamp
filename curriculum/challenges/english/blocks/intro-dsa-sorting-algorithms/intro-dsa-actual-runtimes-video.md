# --description--

In this video, you will compare the actual runtimes for the merge sort, quicksort and selection sort algorithms.

# --questions--

## --text--

What happened in the demo when the quicksort and merge sort algorithms were compared with a dataset of 1 million numbers?

## --answers--

Quicksort and merge sort were equal in their times.

---

Quicksort was slightly slower in sorting the numbers than merge sort.

---
