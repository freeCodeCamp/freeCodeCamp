# --description--

In this step, you are introduced to the `trim()`, `trimStart()`, `trimEnd()`, `toUpperCase()`, `toLowerCase()`, and `slice()` methods in JavaScript. These methods allow you to manipulate strings by removing extra whitespace, changing case, or extracting parts of the string.  

For this step, you need to create a variable called `userInput` and assign it the value `"   Hello World!   "`. This sets up the string that you will transform in the following steps.  

Your task: Create the `userInput` variable and assign it the string with spaces so you can see the original input.

# --hints--

You should have a variable named `userInput` with the value `"   Hello World!   "`.
