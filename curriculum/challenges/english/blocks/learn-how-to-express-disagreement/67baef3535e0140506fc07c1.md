# --explanation--  

To find the correct answer, focus on how David responds to the other person's perspective.  

Pay attention to `I see your perspective, but...` – This shows he acknowledges the other opinion before presenting his own.  

Then, look at `I still think there's value in having everyone in the office.` – This confirms that he believes in the benefits of in-person work, even if he recognizes the advantages of remote work.
