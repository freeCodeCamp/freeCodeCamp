# --explanation--

`Team spirit` is the feeling of connection and cooperation among employees. For example:

- `A strong team spirit helps developers collaborate more effectively.` - When a team works well together, they can solve problems faster.

- `Celebrating small wins boosts team spirit and motivation.` - Recognizing achievements keeps the team engaged and motivated.

`Problem-solving` means finding solutions to challenges. For example:

- `Good problem-solving requires both creativity and logical thinking.` - Finding solutions often involves a mix of innovation and analysis.

- `Problem-solving skills are essential for debugging complex software issues.` - Developers must find and fix errors in their code.
