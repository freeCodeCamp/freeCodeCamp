<!-- (Audio) Anna: That could work. If we create a list of essential items, like a laptop, webcam, and headset, then anything extra could be allocated as they wish. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Bob acknowledges Anna's suggestion. What would he say?

## --answers--

`We should remove the stipend instead.`

### --feedback--

Anna is not suggesting removing the stipend, only setting basic guidelines.

---

`That's a reasonable suggestion.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`That's a reasonable suggestion` is used to agree with an idea in a logical and polite way. For example:

- Person 1: `What if we improve the user interface for better navigation?`

- Person 2: `That's a reasonable suggestion. It will make the app easier to use.` - This person thinks improving the user interface is a good idea for usability.

Bob's response shows that he acknowledges Anna's idea and finds it a fair solution.
