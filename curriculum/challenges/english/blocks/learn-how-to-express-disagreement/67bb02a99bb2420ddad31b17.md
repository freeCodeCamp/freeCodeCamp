# --explanation--

`That's a good suggestion, but` is a way to acknowledge an idea while introducing a concern. This phrase allows for respectful discussion while keeping concerns open for further conversation. For example:

- Person 1: `How about we use this new software to improve productivity?`

- Person 2: `That's a good suggestion, but we should check if it's compatible with our current systems.` - This person acknowledges the idea but highlights a potential compatibility issue.
