## --sentence--

`Bob: Anna, I've been reviewing the survey results for the BLANK stipend. It seems most people prefer using it for BLANK. Do you think that's a good idea?`

`Anna: I don't think so, Bob. While furniture is important, many people mentioned that their computers need upgrades. This might be more critical for productivity.`

`Bob: I understand, but isn't office furniture also a priority? I mean, a lot of people are working from home with BLANK. A comfortable desk and chair can make a big difference.`

`Anna: Not necessarily. Having the latest technology can be just as important. If people are working with outdated computers, it can be a BLANK for productivity.`

`Bob: True, but good office furniture can help prevent BLANK that result from bad posture and make remote work more enjoyable.`

`Anna: I agree that comfort is important, but we shouldn't neglect technology. `

`Bob: So, maybe we should focus on both? Find a BLANK between comfort and technology to ensure everyone has what they need.`

`Anna: That makes sense. Let's see how we can adjust the BLANK to cover both technology and office furniture.`

`Bob: Good plan. Thanks for discussing this with me, Anna.`

`Anna: No problem, Bob. Let's work on the details.`
