# --explanation--

`That way` is used to explain the result or benefit of an idea. For example:

- `If we meet online, we can save time and avoid traveling that way.` - This suggests saving time and avoiding the need to travel by holding the meeting online.

- `You should save your work frequently. That way, you won't lose any progress if the system crashes.` - This advises saving your work often to avoid losing data if something goes wrong.

Anna explains that splitting the stipend helps employees because they can use part of it for technology and part for office furniture.
