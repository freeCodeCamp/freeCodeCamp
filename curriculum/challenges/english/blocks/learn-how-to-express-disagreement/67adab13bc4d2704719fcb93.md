`Find a balance` means to create a fair and effective combination of two different factors. For example:

- `Developers need to find a balance between speed and code quality.` - Writing code quickly is important, but it also needs to be well-structured and bug-free.

- `We need to find a balance between adding features and keeping the app lightweight.` - The app should have useful functions but not become too slow or complex.
