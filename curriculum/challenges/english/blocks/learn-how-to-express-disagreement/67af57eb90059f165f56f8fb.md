# --explanation--

A `disconnect` refers to a lack of connection or communication between people. For example:

- `There's a disconnect between developers and designers on this project.` - The developers and designers are not aligned in their understanding or goals.

- `We need to fix the disconnect between user feedback and product updates.` - The company is not fully considering user feedback when making updates.
