<!-- (Audio) Anna: That's a valid point. However, we've been using collaboration tools to keep everyone connected. It takes some adjustment, but once people get used to it, it works quite well. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What would David say to acknowledge Anna's viewpoint while expressing his own?

## --answers--

`You're completely wrong about remote work.`

### --feedback--

This response does not acknowledge Anna's viewpoint and is too strong for a balanced discussion.

---

`I see your perspective, but I still think there's value in having everyone in the office.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`I see your perspective, but` is a polite way to acknowledge someone's viewpoint before introducing a contrasting opinion. This phrase helps keep discussions respectful and open. For example:

- Person 1: `We should use a new programming language for this project.`

- Person 2: `I see your perspective, but switching languages might slow us down.` - This person understands the idea but points out a possible drawback.
