<!-- (Audio) Jake: Thanks, but I see many data types listed in the documentation. How do I know which one to choose? -->

# --description--

The verb `choose` means to select or decide on one or more options from a set. It is often followed by `from` implying selecting from a specific group or list.

For example, `At the restaurant, you can choose from ten different desserts.` In this sentence, `choose from` is used to imply that the restaurant offers a variety of ten desserts, and you have the freedom to make a selection based on your preference.
