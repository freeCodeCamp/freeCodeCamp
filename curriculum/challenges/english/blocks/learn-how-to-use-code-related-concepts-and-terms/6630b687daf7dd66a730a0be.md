<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Sure. Data types are fundamental in programming. You use them to tell the computer what kind of data you're working with.-->

# --description--

The word `fundamental` implies something is basic or essential, much like the foundation of a house.

For example, `Understanding grammar is fundamental to learning a new language.` Here `fundamental` is used to emphasize that grammar is an essential or basic part of learning any new language.

The phrase `what kind of` is used to ask about the type or nature of something. It's a common way to specify or classify something more clearly.

For instance, when someone asks `what kind of music do you like?` they are asking about the genre of music.
