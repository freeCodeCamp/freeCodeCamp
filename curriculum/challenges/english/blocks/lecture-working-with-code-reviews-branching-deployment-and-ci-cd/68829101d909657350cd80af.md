# --description--

GitHub Pages is a really solid option for deploying static sites, or applications that do not require a back-end server to handle logic. That is, applications that run entirely client-side, or in the user's browser, can be fully deployed on this platform.

Additionally, GitHub Pages are completely free for open source projects. There are plenty of good reasons to make your project open source, and Pages adds yet another.

But how do you actually deploy to GitHub Pages? Well, that depends on how your application works.

Let's start with a basic HTML page. We can add one to our existing example repository:

Now we need to visit our repository. Let's double check that the files are there:

There's our file! Now, we need to go to the repository settings. Then we need to select "Pages" from the sidebar:

There's only a few options initially, but that's going to change as we start configuring the settings. First, we need to tell GitHub what to deploy from.

We'll want to leave this as "Deploy from a branch", because we aren't using a framework and have not configured any GitHub actions at all. You'll learn more about what those are in an upcoming lecture.

We need to choose the branch that we are deploying from. We still have our feature branch, because we haven't deleted it yet, but we pushed the new HTML file to main directly. So let's go ahead and set this to deploy from our main branch.

You'll then get a choice to deploy from your project's root folder or from a docs folder. This feature is used by projects like freeCodeCamp - we used to bundle documentation with our app, so we could deploy just the documentation onto GitHub pages via the docs folder.

Our example repo does not have a docs folder, so let's leave this as / (root). Hit the Save button next to this drop down to save your changes.

One you've saved, you'll see a new input to configure a custom domain. If you have one already, and would like to use it, you can follow the link to the docs to do so. For this lecture, however, we are going to leave this blank.

You can also see the domain that your new GitHub Pages site has been deployed to. Without a custom domain, this defaults to <username>.github.io, where <username> is the name of your account (or the organisation's account if you are deploying from an org-owned repository).

It's important to note that the base path for your domain, like naomi-lgbt.github.io/, must be deployed from a specific repository that matches the domain. So Naomi would create a repository named naomi-lgbt.github.io to deploy the homepage for her GitHub Pages domain.

Since our repository is NOT named that way, it'll be served on a path matching the repository's name. In this case, our repository is freecodecamp-lecture - we'll need to visit naomi-lgbt.github.io/freecodecamp-lecture. Let's take a look!

There's our HTML! We have successfully deployed to GitHub Pages! Buuuuuuutâ€¦

Our site is rather boring. Let's go ahead and add a bit more content to the page, and the boilerplate HTML while we're there:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css" />
    <script src="./script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to freeCodeCamp's Lecture!</h1>
    <p>Let's have some fun learning about Git and GitHub!</p>
    <button type="button" onclick="haveFun()">I want fun!</button>
  </body>
</html>

We've set up the imports for some CSS and some JavaScript, so let's write those:

body {
    background: lightblue;
    color: pink;
}

function haveFun() {
    document.body.style.background === "green" ? document.body.style.background =
"lightblue" : document.body.style.background = "green";
}

Let's go ahead and commit these and push them up to our main branch. When we do this, GitHub Pages will automatically update our deployed site with the latest changes. This process can take a few minutes, depending on server load - and you may need to do a hard refresh to clear the cache.

Let's peek at the updated site:

The contrast on our site is not great, but if you click the "I want fun!" button the background changes!

And with that, we have successfully deployed a basic web application to GitHub Pages. You have learned how to include CSS and JavaScript files in your Pages deployment, so you can build beautiful and interactive sites. And once you learn a framework like React or Angular, you can even deploy those on GitHub Pages too!
