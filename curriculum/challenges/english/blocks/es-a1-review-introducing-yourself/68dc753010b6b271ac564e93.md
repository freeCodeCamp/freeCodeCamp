## Grammar Highlights

### Conjugation of `tener` in Present Indicative Tense

The verb `tener` (to have) is commonly used to talk about **age** in Spanish. Instead of saying "I am 28 years old," you say "I have 28 years."

| Person               | Conjugation | English Meaning         |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| `yo tengo`           | `tengo`     | I have / I am (age)     |
| `tú tienes`          | `tienes`    | you have (informal)     |
| `él/ella tiene`      | `tiene`     | he/she has              |
| `nosotros/as tenemos`| `tenemos`   | we have                 |
| `ellos/as tienen`    | `tienen`    | they have               |

Examples:

- `Tengo veintiocho años.` – I am 28 years old.

- `Tengo treinta y seis años.` – I am 36 years old.

### Nationalities and Gender Agreement

In Spanish, nationalities must agree in gender with the person they're describing:

- Masculine nationalities often end in `-o` or a consonant.
- Feminine forms often end in `-a`.

Examples:

- `Soy chilena.` – I am Chilean (feminine).  
- `Soy puertorriqueño.` – I am Puerto Rican (masculine).  
- `Soy uruguaya.` – I am Uruguayan (feminine).

### Greetings by Time of Day

Spanish greetings change depending on the time of day:

- `Buenos días` – Good morning
- `Buenas tardes` – Good afternoon
- `Buenas noches` – Good evening/night

These are polite and time-sensitive ways to start a conversation.
