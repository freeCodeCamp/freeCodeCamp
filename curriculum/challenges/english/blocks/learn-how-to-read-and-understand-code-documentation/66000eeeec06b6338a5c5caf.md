<!-- (Audio) Tom: I often find function descriptions in the documentation, but I'm not sure how to interpret them. What should I focus on when reading these? -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

How frequently does Tom find function descriptions in the documentation?

## --answers--

`Rarely`

### --feedback--

`Rarely` indicates something happens not often. However, Tom uses `often`, indicating a more frequent occurrence.

---

`Sometimes`

### --feedback--

`Sometimes` suggests occasional occurrence, but Tom's use of `often` implies it happens more regularly than just sometimes.

---

`Often`

---

`Always`

### --feedback--

`Always` would mean it happens every time, which is a stronger frequency than `often`.
