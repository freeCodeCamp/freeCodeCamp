<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Also, check for any examples or code snippets. They can help illustrate how to use the function effectively. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why should Tom check for examples and code snippets according to Sarah?

## --answers--

To help illustrate how to use the function effectively

---

To determine the coding style of the documentation

### --feedback--

While understanding coding style is important, Sarah's specific reason for suggesting to check examples and snippets is to illustrate how to use the function.

---

To find errors in the function's code

### --feedback--

Sarah recommends looking at examples and snippets for understanding usage, not necessarily for error checking.

---

To rewrite the function in a different way

### --feedback--

The purpose of checking examples and snippets is to learn how to use the function as it is, not to rewrite it.
