<!-- (AUDIO) Sebastián: Mucho gusto, Ángela. -->

# --description--

Now let's see how you can reply politely after someone introduces themselves.

Both `Mucho gusto` and `Encantada/Encantado` mean "Nice to meet you".

`Mucho gusto` is gender-neutral and can be used in most situations. 

`Encantada/Encantado` can be more expressive and must agree with the speaker's gender.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Encantado` | **Masculine** (`-o`) | Nice to meet you. |
| `Encantada` | **Feminine** (`-a`) | Nice to meet you. |
