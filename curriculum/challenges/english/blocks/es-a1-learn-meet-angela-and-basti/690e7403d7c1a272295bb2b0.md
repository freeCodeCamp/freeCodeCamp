<!-- (AUDIO) Sebastián: Mucho gusto, Ángela. ¿De dónde eres? -->

# --description--

Now you will learn how to ask for someone's place of origin.

`¿De dónde eres?` is the standard, informal way to ask this in Spanish. It is equivalent to "Where are you from?"

Since origin is a permanent trait, the phrase has a conjugated form of the verb `ser` (`eres`), using the pronoun `tú` ("you").

The formal version of this question is `¿De dónde es usted?`, using the pronoun `usted` ("you").
