# --description--

Color theory is the study of how colors interact with each other and how they affect our perception. It covers color relationships, color harmony, and the psychological impact of color. Let's start diving into this world. Colors can be classified as either primary, secondary, or tertiary.

  <!-- Secondary Colors -->

  <path d="M110,150 L150,190 L50,190 Z" fill="green"/>

Primary colors - yellow, blue, and red - are the fundamental hues from which all other colors are derived, as shown in the outer segments of the color wheel above.

Secondary colors result from mixing equal amounts of two primary colors. Green, orange, and purple are examples of secondary colors, as shown in the inner segments of the wheel. For example, green is the result of combining yellow and blue.

Tertiary colors result from combining a primary color with a neighboring secondary color. Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, and Blue-Violet, are examples of tertiary colors.

This is a fundamental classification in the world of color theory, but there are other ways to classify colors. They can be classified as warm or cool, based on their temperature.

Warm colors, which include reds, oranges, and yellows, evoke feelings of comfort, warmth, and coziness.

Cool colors, which include blues, greens, and purples, evoke feelings of calmness, serenity, and professionalism.

There are several color schemes used in design, as illustrated above:

- **Analogous Color Schemes**: These color schemes create cohesive and soothing experiences. They have analogous colors, which are adjacent to each other in the color wheel (shown in the bottom row of the diagram).
- **Complementary Color Schemes**: These color schemes create high contrast and visual impact. Their colors are located on the opposite ends of the color wheel, relative to each other (shown in the top row of the diagram).
- **Triadic Color Scheme**: This color scheme has vibrant colors. They are made from colors that are approximately equidistant from each other. If they are connected, they form an equilateral triangle on the color wheel.
- **Monochromatic Color Scheme**: For this color scheme, all the colors are derived from the same base color by adjusting its lightness, darkness, and saturation. This evokes a feeling of unity and harmony while still creating contrast.

And finally, here are some tips for using color effectively in web development:

- Create a color scheme that defines your website's branding.
- Use colors to evoke the emotions and perceptions that align with your goals.
- Choose colors with enough contrast to make your website accessible for everyone.
- Use color to highlight important elements of your website, like buttons.
- Use color consistently and use it to create a visual hierarchy.

Color theory is a core aspect of design. By understanding color psychology, harmonies, and accessibility, you can create effective designs, evoke emotions, and enhance user experience.
