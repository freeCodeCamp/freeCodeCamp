# --description--

An `infographic` is a visual image like a chart or diagram used to represent information. For example:

`The infographic shows the survey results clearly.` - Here, `infographic` means a picture that explains data in an easy-to-read way.

An `interactive infographic` is a type of infographic that allows the viewer to click, hover, or scroll to explore the information. For example:

`The company made an interactive infographic where readers can click to see details about each product.` - Here, `interactive infographic` means a visual that not only shows information but also lets the reader interact with it.
