<!-- (Audio) Bob: I'm supposed to figure out if our current practices are robust enough to protect sensitive information. -->

# --description--

`Robust` means strong, powerful, or able to work well without breaking easily. For example:

`A robust system can handle many users.` - This means the system is strong and does not fail even with a lot of users.

`Enough` means as much as is needed or required. For example:

`Do we have enough chairs?` - This asks if the number of chairs is sufficient.

Together, `robust enough` means something is strong or effective to the necessary level. For example:

`Is the password robust enough to prevent hacking?` - This asks if the password is strong enough to protect against hackers.
