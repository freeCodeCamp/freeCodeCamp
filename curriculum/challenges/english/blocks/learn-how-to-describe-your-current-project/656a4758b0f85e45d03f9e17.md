# --description--

An `interview` is a conversation where someone asks questions to get information. For example:

`He had an interview for a job at the bank.` - Here, an `interview` means the formal meeting where he was asked questions about the job.

A `video interview` is a type of interview that happens online using video tools like Zoom, Teams, or Skype instead of meeting face-to-face. It is common in jobs, schools, and research when people cannot be in the same place.
