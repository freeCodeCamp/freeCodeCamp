<!-- (Audio) Mark: We're also asking some people to tell us what they think. It's a bit busy, but I'm learning a lot. -->

# --description--

Remember: `Their` is a possessive pronoun. It shows that something belongs to a group of people. 

For example, `Their opinions are important` means the opinions of a group of people are important.

`Thoughts` means what someone thinks or their ideas. When we ask for someone's `thoughts`, we want to know what they think or feel about something. For example:

`What are their thoughts on this book?` is asking for the group's opinion about the book.
