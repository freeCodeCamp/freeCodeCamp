<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Hi Bob! I'm looking at customer data to find patterns -->

# --description--

`Patterns` are regular and repeated ways in which something happens or is done. In data, patterns can show trends or behaviors. 

For example, a `pattern` in customer data might be that more people use bows as accessories. This is a `trend pattern`.

There are also `cycle patterns`, like a coffee shop selling more coffee in the morning. 

`Patterns` can be found in numbers, like sales increasing every month, or in behaviors, like customers preferring to shop online.
