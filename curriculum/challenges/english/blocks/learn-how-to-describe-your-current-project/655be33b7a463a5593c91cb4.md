You say something is `definite` when you are certain about it. 

When you add the suffix `-ly`, `definite` becomes an adverb, `definitely`, which means being sure about something or being confident about it.

- `I can definitely see why this is important.` - This emphasizes that the importance is expected to be clear.

- `She will definitely finish the project on time.` - This shows confidence in her completing the project.
