<!-- (Audio) Mark: Nice. Good luck there. -->

# --description--

`Luck` means when something good or successful happens by chance, not because of effort. For example:

- `He found his lost phone by luck.` - This shows that he found it by chance, not because he searched well.

- `I wish you luck on your test.` - This means you are hoping the other person has success.

`Good luck` is a common phrase people say to wish someone well. For example:

`Good luck with your interview!` - Here, `good luck` is wishing success in the interview.
