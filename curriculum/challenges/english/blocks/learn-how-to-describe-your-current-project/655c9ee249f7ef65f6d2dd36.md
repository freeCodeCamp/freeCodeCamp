<!-- (Audio) Maria: That's good to hear. I'm managing the team that's making a new part for the client's platform. We're trying to work on it and talk to the client to make sure they like it. -->

# --description--

Let's practice!

# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Maria need to talk to the client?

## --answers--

To get more ideas for the platform

### --feedback--

Maria's goal is to ensure the client likes the new part, not necessarily to get more ideas.

---

To ask the client for technical help

### --feedback--

Maria is managing the team herself; they are talking to the client for approval, not technical help.

---

To instruct the client on how to use the new part

### --feedback--

The conversation with the client is to get their approval, not to provide instructions on use.

---

To make sure the client likes the new part they are making
