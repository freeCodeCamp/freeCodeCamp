<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Hey, James. What's your cybersecurity project about? -->

# --description--

`What` is often used to ask for specific information. It can ask about things, actions, or details that someone wants to know. For example:

- `What time is the meeting?` - This asks for the exact time of the meeting.

- `What do you usually have for lunch?` - This asks for details about someone's routine.

So, `what` helps you get clear answers when you want to know something specific.
