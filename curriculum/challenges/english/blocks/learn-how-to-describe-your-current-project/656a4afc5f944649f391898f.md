<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I'm attending online courses in data visualization, and I'm also exploring creative writing. It's a bit different from my usual work, but I'm enjoying the change. -->

# --description--

`Different from` is a phrase you use to show that two things are not the same. For example:

- `My phone is different from yours.` - This means the two phones are not the same.

- `Her job is different from mine.` - This means her job and your job are not the same.

Notice that `different` is the adjective, and it is usually followed by `from` in this structure.
