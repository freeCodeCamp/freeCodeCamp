# --description--

The last console statement outputs `-1` because the substring `"learning"` is not found in the `"Learning is fun.` sentence.

The `indexOf` method is case-sensitive. So the substring `"learning"` is not the same as the substring `"Learning"`.

Now that you understand how some common string methods work, you can complete the workshop by logging one last message to the `console`.

Add a `console` statement that outputs the message `"I hope you enjoyed learning today."` to the `console`.

And with that final message, you have completed the workshop!

# --hints--

Your `console` statement should output the message `"I hope you enjoyed learning today."`.

```js
assert.match(code, /console\.log\(\s*(['"])(I\s+hope\s+you\s+enjoyed\s+learning\s+today\.)\1\s*\)/);
```

console.log(`Here is an example of accessing the second letter in the word ${subject}.`);
console.log(subject[1]);

console.log(`Here is an example of accessing the last letter in the word ${subject}.`);

const lastCharacter = subject[subject.length - 1];
console.log(lastCharacter);

const learningIsFunSentence = "Learning is fun.";

console.log("Here are examples of finding the positions of substrings in the sentence.");

console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("Learning"));

console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("fun"));
console.log(learningIsFunSentence.indexOf("learning"));
