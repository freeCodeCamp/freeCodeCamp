## Introduction to Version Control 

- **Definition**: A Version control system allows you to track and manage changes in your project. Examples of version control systems used in software are Git, SVN, or Mercurial.

## Installing and Setting up Git

- **Installing Git**: To check if Git is already installed on your machine you can run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
git --version
```

If you see a version number, that means Git is installed. If not, then you will need to install it.

For Linux systems, Git often comes preinstalled with most distros. If you do not have Git pre-installed, you should be able to install it with your package manager commands such as `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo pacman -S git`.

For Mac users, you can install Git via Homebrew with `brew install git`, or you can download the executable installer from Git's website.

For Windows, you can download the executable installer from Git's website. Or, if you have set up Chocolatey, you can run `choco install git.install` in PowerShell. Note that on Windows, you may also want to download GitBash so you have a Unix-like shell environment available.

To make sure the installation worked, run the `git --version` command again in the terminal.

- **Git Configurations**: `git config` is used to set configuration variables that are responsible for how Git operates on your machine. To view your current setting variables and where they are stored on your system, you can run the following command:

```sh
git config --list --show-origin
```

Right now you should be seeing only system-level configuration settings if you just installed Git for the first time. 

To set your user name, you can run the following command:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Jane Doe"
```

The `--global` flag is used here to set the user name for all projects on your system that use Git. If you need to override the user name for a particular project, then you can run the command in that particular project directory without the `--global` flag.

To set the user email address, you can run the following command:

```sh
git config --global user.email janedoe@example.com
```

Another configuration you can set is the preferred editor you want Git to use. Here is an example of how to set your preferred editor to Emacs:

```sh
git config --global core.editor emacs
```

If you choose not to set a preferred editor, then Git will default to your system's default editor.

## Open vs Closed Source Software

- **Definition**: "Open-source" means people can see the code you publish, propose changes, report issues, and even run a modified version.  "Closed-source" means the only people who can see and interact with the project are the people you explicitly authorize.

## Github 

- **Definition**: GitHub is a cloud-based solution that offer storage of version-controlled projects in something called "repositories", and enable collaboration features to use with those projects.
- **GitHub CLI**: This tool is used to do GitHub-specific tasks without leaving the command line. If you do not have it installed, you can get instructions to do so from GitHub's documentation - but you should have it available in your system's package manager.

## Working with Repositories 

- **Definition**: A repository is like a container for a project - if you are working on an app, you would keep the files for that app together in a repository. Repositories can be local on your computer, or remote on a service like GitHub. 
- **Public vs. Private Repositories**: A public repository can be viewed and downloaded by anyone. A private repository can only be accessed by you, and anyone you grant explicit access to.
- **Cloning a Repository**: Cloning a repository means you will have a copy of the repository. This copy includes the repository history, all files/folders and commits on your local device.

## Working with SSH and GPG Keys 

- **GPG Keys**: GPG, or Gnu Privacy Guard, keys are typically used to sign files or commits. Someone can then use your public GPG key to verify that the file signature is from your key and that the contents of the file have not been modified or tampered with. 

To generate a GPG key, you'll need to run:

```sh
gpg --full-generate-key
```

- **SSH Keys**: SSH, or Secure SHell, keys are typically used to authenticate a remote connection to a server - via the `ssh` utility. However, as you'll learn in this lecture, you can also use an SSH key to sign commits.

For an SSH key, you'll run:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

- **Signing Commits with GPG Keys**: In order to sign your commits with your GPG key, you'll need to upload your public key, not the private key, to your GitHub account. Then, take the short ID you got from listing the keys earlier, and run this command to set it as your git signing key:

```sh
git config --global user.signingkey <your_gpg_key_id>
```

Then, you can pass the `-S` flag to your `git commit` command to sign a specific commit - you'll need to provide your passphrase. Alternatively, if you want to sign every commit automatically, you can set the autosign config to `true`:

```sh
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

- **Signing Commits with SSH Keys**: To sign with an SSH key, which is a relatively new feature on GitHub, you'll need to start by uploading the key to your GitHub account. Then you'll need to set the signing mode for git to use SSH:

```sh
git config --global gpg.format ssh
```

Then, to set the signing key, you'll pass the file path instead of an ID:

```sh
git config --global user.signingkey <path_to_your_ssh_keys>
```
