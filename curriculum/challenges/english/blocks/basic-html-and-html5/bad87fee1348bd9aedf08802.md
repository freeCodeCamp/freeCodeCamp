# --description--

Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Comments in HTML start with `<!--` and end with a `-->`

# --instructions--

Uncomment your `h1`, `h2` and `p` elements.

# --hints--

Your `h1` element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it.

```js
assert.notEmpty(document.querySelectorAll('h1'));
```

Your `h2` element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it.

```js
assert.notEmpty(document.querySelectorAll('h2'));
```

Your `p` element should be visible on the page by uncommenting it.

```js
assert.notEmpty(document.querySelectorAll('p'));
```

No trailing comment tags should be visible on the page (i.e. `-->`).

```js
const elements = document.querySelectorAll('*');
const potentialComments = Array.from(elements).filter(el => el.textContent.includes('-->'));
assert.notExists(potentialComments[1])
```
