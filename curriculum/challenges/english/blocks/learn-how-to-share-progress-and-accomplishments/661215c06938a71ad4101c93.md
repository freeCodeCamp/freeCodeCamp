A `market` is a place or area where goods are sold, or in business, it refers to the group of people who might buy a product. For example, `We studied the smartphone market.`

`To gather` means to collect or bring together. In business, you might `gather` information or data, like `We gathered customer feedback.`

An `informed decision` is a choice made based on good information or knowledge. For example, `After researching, we made an informed decision about our project.`
