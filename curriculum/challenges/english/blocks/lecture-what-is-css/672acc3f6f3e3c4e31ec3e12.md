# --interactive--

When working with CSS, you often encounter three different types of display behaviors for elements: `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block`.

Each of these properties affects how elements are positioned and how they interact with other elements on the page.

In this lesson, we will focus on how the `inline-block` property works and how it differs from both inline and block-level elements.

Block-level elements behave like large containers that take up the full width of their parent container. They always start on a new line, and their height and width can be adjusted.

Inline elements only take up as much space as they need. They flow within surrounding content and do not break onto a new line.

The `inline-block` property is a hybrid of these two behaviors. Like inline elements, `inline-block` elements remain in the text flow without starting on a new line.

However, unlike inline elements, you can adjust the width and height of an `inline-block` element, just as you would with block-level elements.

In short, the key difference between `inline` and `inline-block` is that inline elements cannot have their size controlled, while inline-block elements allow full control over dimensions while still staying inline with other content.

Let's take a look at an example.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">

<div class="container">
  <span class="inline-block-element element1">Inline-Block</span>
  <span class="inline-block-element element2">Inline-Block</span>
</div>
````

```css
.inline-block-element {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 150px;
  height: 100px;
}

.element1 {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.element2 {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```

:::

In the above example, we have a `div` with a class of `container`. Inside that `div`, there are two `span` elements.

Each `span` is set to `display: inline-block` and has a width and height defined.

The inline-block elements appear side by side because they behave like inline elements, but they also have a specified width and height, which gives them block-like characteristics.

But if you remove the `display: inline-block` property, neither the width nor the height will be applied even though you defined them.

Here is the revised CSS:

In this version, `display: inline-block;` has been removed while keeping the width and height in place. The spans return to their default inline behavior.

As a result, their defined width and height are ignored, and they only take up the space needed for their content.

Understanding how `inline-block` works is helpful when you need both alignment and control over dimensions within a continuous flow of text.
