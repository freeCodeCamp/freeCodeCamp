# --explanation--

David is trying to confirm whether the `budget tracking feature` was planned for the current update or scheduled for a future one.

He says `was that supposed to be in this update, or is it coming later?` â€” this helps you understand that he's asking about the feature's timing, not about delays, removal, or testing.
