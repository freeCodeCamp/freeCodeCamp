Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Sophie mean?

## --answers--

She means organizing code into separate files for better readability.

### --feedback--

Sophie is not talking about organizing code into files.

---

She means hiding certain details in the code to make it easier to use and manage.

---

She means making the code more complex so other parts can't interact with it.

### --feedback--

Sophie emphasizes making the code simpler and easier to manage, not more complex.

---

She means exposing all the details of the code to other parts of the program.

### --feedback--

This contradicts what Sophie is saying. She mentions limiting access to code details, not exposing them.

# --explanation--

`Wrapping code` in this context refers to the practice of hiding the internal details of the code and only exposing what is necessary.

This helps make the code easier to manage and reduces complexity for the user of the code, allowing them to focus on what's important without worrying about internal workings.
