`Glitching` refers to a temporary error or malfunction, especially in digital systems. For example:

`The screen keeps glitching.` – This means the screen isn't working properly and might flash or freeze.

`Does that make sense?` is a way to check if the other person understood what you just said. For example:

`I'll send the report by noon. Does that make sense?` – You're asking if the plan is clear and acceptable.
