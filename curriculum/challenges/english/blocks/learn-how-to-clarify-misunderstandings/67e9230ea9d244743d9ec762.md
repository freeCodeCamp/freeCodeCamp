`Simplifying` means reducing complexity to make something easier to understand or work with. For example:

`The new framework is simplifying how developers handle user input.` - This means the framework removes extra steps or confusing parts to make things clearer.

`Unnecessary` refers to something that is not essential or useful in a given context. For example:

`We removed unnecessary comments from the code to keep it clean.` - These comments weren't needed and made the code harder to read, so they were taken out to improve clarity.
