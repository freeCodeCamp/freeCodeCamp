`Got one right` means you answered at least one question correctly, even if others were incorrect. It's often used to express relief or a small success in a challenging situation. For example:

`I didn't know all the quiz answers, but I got one right.` - This shows a small win, even in a tough moment.

`Starting to understand` means you are beginning to learn or make sense of something. For example:

`After a few examples, I'm starting to understand how classes work in Python.` - You don't fully master the topic yet, but your understanding is growing.
