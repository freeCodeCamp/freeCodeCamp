# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`It's more BLANK. Sometimes it works fine, but other times it acts weird.`

## --blanks--

`random`

### --feedback--

This word means that something happens in a way that is unpredictable or without a clear pattern.

# --explanation--

`Random` means that something doesn't happen in a specific order and you can't predict when or how it will happen. For example:

`The problem is random.` â€“ This means you can't predict what the issue will be like and it changes unexpectedly.

`More random` means that the situation is becoming less predictable than before. It is less regular and harder to guess what will happen next.
