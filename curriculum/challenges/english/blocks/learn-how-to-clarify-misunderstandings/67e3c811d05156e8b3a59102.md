`Code structure` refers to the way code is organized and structured to define how a program works. It helps programmers to manage the code more effectively and makes it easier to understand and modify. For example:

`In Python, the code structure includes functions and classes that help organize the program.` - This sentence shows how Python organizes code into functions and classes, which are basic `code structures`.

`Multiple shapes or forms` refer to the idea that something can exist in different variations, types, or appearances, depending on the context. For example:  

`A button in a web app can have multiple shapes or forms, such as a round button, a square button, or a rectangular button.` - This means the button can appear in various forms based on design choices.
