# --explanation--

`I need your help with something.` – Mark is expressing that he requires assistance.
  
`There's a strange issue with the software.` – Mark introduces the problem, saying it's unusual or difficult to understand.

`Can you take a look?` – Mark then asks Lisa to take a look, which means he wants her to examine the issue. 

So, Mark's request is for Lisa to help by quickly looking at the software issue to better understand what's going on. He doesn't need her to fix or describe the issue.
