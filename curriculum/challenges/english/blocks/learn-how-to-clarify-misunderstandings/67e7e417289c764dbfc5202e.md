## --blanks--

`what`

### --feedback--

This word is used to introduce a noun clause, which explains the thing that is being limited or restricted in this context.

# --explanation--

In the phrase `limit what other parts can see`, `what` introduces a noun clause, which serves as the object of `limit`.

A noun clause is a clause that acts as a noun within a sentence. It can function as the object or the subject of a sentence. It usually starts with words like `that`, `what`, `whether`, `who`, `when`, `why`, `how`, etc.

Noun clauses use normal statement word order (not question order). For example:

- `The team is checking why the system crashed during the update.` - `Why the system crashed during the update` is the noun clause acting as the object of `checking`.
   
- `What the function returns depends on the input data.` - `What the function returns` is a noun clause acting as the subject of `depends on`.
