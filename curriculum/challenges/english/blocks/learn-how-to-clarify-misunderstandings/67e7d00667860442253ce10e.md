# --explanation--

Mark is asking whether encapsulation means `breaking code into smaller parts`. This shows he is trying to understand the concept in terms of organizing code better.

While he doesn't fully define encapsulation, he's on the right track â€” encapsulation involves grouping related data and behavior into a single unit, which often leads to cleaner and more manageable code.
