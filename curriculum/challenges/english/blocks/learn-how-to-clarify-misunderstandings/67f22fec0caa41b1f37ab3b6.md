<!-- SPEAKING -->

<!-- (Audio) David: Does that mean the app's launch will be delayed? I thought we were on track to release by the end of the week. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How will Jessica most likely respond if the delay is still uncertain?

## --answers--

`Yes, it's definitely delayed.`

### --feedback--

This would be too strong if the situation isn't confirmed.

---

`Not necessarily.`

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

David is asking if the launch will be delayed. He seems unsure and wants confirmation.

If Jessica isn't certain yet, saying `Not necessarily` shows that a delay is possible, but not confirmed â€” it keeps the conversation open while avoiding a clear yes or no.
