# --explanation--

Mark says `Does that make sense?` after explaining a problem with the menu. This phrase is often used to check if the listener understands what's being said.

The response `I think so` is a typical way to show understanding without needing to go into more detail. It means Lisa believes she now understands the issue Mark is describing.
