`Not quite` is used when you agree with something, but not fully. It's a polite way of saying someone is close but needs a small correction. For example:

- Person 1: `Are we done with the project?`

- Person 2: `Not quite, we still have some testing to do.` - This shows the project is almost finished, but not completely.

`Keeping ... hidden` means to protect or hide certain details or information. For example:

`By keeping the password hidden in the system, we protect user privacy.` - This means the password is not accessible directly, ensuring privacy and security.
