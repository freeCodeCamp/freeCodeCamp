<!-- (Audio) Mark: Oh, okay. Thanks for explaining. I also heard "encapsulation." Does that mean breaking code into smaller parts, like encapsulating it? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How will Sophie respond if she thinks Mark's understanding of encapsulation is not completely correct?

## --answers--

`Not quite.`

---

`Yes, exactly.`

### --feedback--

This would be too strong of an agreement, as Sophie is likely to correct Mark's understanding slightly.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Sophie would likely say `not quite` to indicate that Mark's understanding is partially correct but not entirely accurate.

This response is softer and more cautious, showing that she agrees to a certain extent but feels that Mark's idea isn't fully accurate.
