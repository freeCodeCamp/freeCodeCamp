`Behave` means to act in a certain way or perform an action based on conditions. For example:

`The method will behave differently when given different data types.` - This means the method will act in different ways depending on the type of data it receives.

`Depending on the context` means that something changes based on the situation or conditions in which it occurs. For example:

`The response time of an application can be different depending on the context of the user's request.` - This means that how quickly the application responds could change based on factors like the type of request or the current system load.
