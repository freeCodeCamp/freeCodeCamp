These four words together mean not showing how something works internally, only showing the essential parts. The first word ends with `-ing`.

# --explanation--

`Complexity` refers to how complicated or difficult something is, especially when it has many parts or steps. For example:

`The back-end logic added a lot of complexity to the app.` - This means the back-end code made the application harder to understand or manage.

`Keeping the details hidden` means not showing all the internal steps or how something works, only what is necessary. For example:

`The user interface hides the complexity of the system by keeping the details hidden.` – This means users only see what they need, without the technical background.
