# --explanation--

`Brainstorming` is when people gather ideas in a group, trying to think of creative or useful solutions. For example:

`The team is brainstorming ideas for a new product feature.` - It shows they are working together to come up with as many ideas as possible.

`Incorporating` means adding or including something in a plan, activity, or project. For example:

`They are incorporating customer feedback into the product design.` - This means they are adding the feedback as part of the design process to improve the product.

`Real-life scenarios` are practical situations similar to those participants might face in reality, helping them practice responses and develop skills for actual challenges. For example:

`The training uses real-life scenarios, such as troubleshooting a common technical issue.` - Here, `real-life scenarios` make the training relevant and directly applicable by using realistic situations.
