# --explanation--

`Present Perfect Continuous` tense negative form emphasizes an ongoing action that has lacked consistency over time, while the `Present Perfect` tense negative form indicates that an action hasn't occurred at all up to now.

`Past Continuous` tense negative form deals with an action that was not happening at a specific past moment, focusing solely on the past.

`Present Simple` tense negative form shows a lack of regularity or habitual behavior, describing an action that generally does not happen.
