The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense is used to describe actions that started in the past and are still happening. It focuses on the duration or continuation of the action. The structure of this tense is `have/has + been + verb(-ing)`. For example:

- `We have been developing a new app for accessibility.` - This means the development started in the past and is still ongoing.

- `He has been fixing bugs in the software for several hours.` - This means he started fixing the bugs earlier and is still working on it.
