`After Anna and James discussed ways to enhance accessibility training, they created a plan to meet the goals of making products accessible to everyone. This training will provide the team with an understanding of key accessibility principles and skills to identify and address common issues.`

`The training will start by conducting an overview of essential accessibility concepts, such as color contrast, screen reader compatibility, and keyboard navigation. To make the sessions engaging, the plan includes interactive activities and real-life scenarios â€” like navigating without a mouse or relying on a screen reader. These exercises are designed to show the importance of removing accessibility barriers.`

`Throughout the training, they will gather feedback to understand what's effective and find areas to improve. This approach will help the team develop practical skills and make accessibility a natural part of their work.`
