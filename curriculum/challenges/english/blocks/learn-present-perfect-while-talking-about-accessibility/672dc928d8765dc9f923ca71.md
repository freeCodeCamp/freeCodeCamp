# --explanation--

A `gradual process` refers to something that develops slowly, over time, rather than happening quickly. For example:

`Learning a new skill is often a gradual process.` - This means that gaining a new skill takes time and happens step-by-step, not all at once.

`Steady progress` means continuous, consistent improvement without interruptions. For example:

`The team has made steady progress in completing the project.` - This shows that the team is moving forward regularly and effectively, without major delays.

`Understanding` refers to a person's knowledge or awareness about a subject. For example:

`Her understanding of coding improved with practice.` - It highlights how her knowledge of coding grew as she spent more time practicing.
