`Real-world` means something that happens in real life, not in a test or a made-up situation. For example:  

`We tested the new app in real-world conditions to see how it works.` - It means the app was tested in normal, everyday situations to make sure it works well.

`Feedback` means advice or comments to help someone improve. For example:  

`The project manager gave feedback on my work so I can do better next time.` - It means the project manager offers advice to help you improve your work.

`Roll it out` means to launch or release a product or service to a wider audience. For example:

`We will roll out the new feature to all users next month.` - It indicates that the new feature will be released for public use, moving from testing to being available to everyone.
