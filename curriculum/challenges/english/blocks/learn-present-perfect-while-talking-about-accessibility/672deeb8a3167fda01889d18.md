`Interactive` means something that lets people participate or take action, rather than just watching or listening. For example:

`The training included interactive games to help learners practice their skills.` - It shows that people are actively involved in the games, not just observing.

`Activities` are tasks or exercises people do to learn or practice skills. For example:

`The activities in the workshop helped everyone understand the material better.` - This means that the tasks helped people engage with and understand the content.

`Scenarios` are specific situations or examples created to help people imagine or explore real-life situations. For example,

`In the project meeting, we discussed different scenarios to prepare for possible challenges.` - Here, it means to imagine situations that help the team think about potential issues and find solutions ahead of time.
