# --description--

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

# --user stories--

1. You should model the ledger as `{ [assetTag]: { type, status, borrower: { name, email }, dueDate } }`.

2. You should write a `checkoutDevice(ledger, assetTag, borrower)` function that copies the ledger object, sets `borrower` name and email address info, and returns a confirmation message.

3. You should write a `checkinDevice(ledger, assetTag)` function that clears the borrower's name and email, as well as the `dueDate` property, and updates the device's `status`.

4. You should write a `listOverdueDevices(ledger, today)` function that returns an array of overdue entries sorted by due date. Do not use the JavaScript Date object for this lab exercise.

5. You should write `serializeLedger(ledger)` and `loadLedger(json)` helpers functions to load (convert) a JSON file into a JavaScript object, or save (serialize) a JavaScript object into a JSON object. 

_Hint: Refer back to your JSON lessons preceeding this lab if you need help.

# --hints--

1. You should have a ledger of IT assets, where each asset is an item in the ledger object.

2. Each IT asset should have an `assetTag` key with data type Number.

3. The `assetTag` should have a value that is of type Object.

4. The `assetTag` value should have the following key/value pairs: type (string), status (string), borrower (object), dueDate (string).

5. The borrower object should have the following key/value pairs: name (string), email (string).

6. You should have a `checkoutDevice(ledger, assetTag, borrower)` function that returns a confirmation string.

7. The `checkoutDevice()` function should update the status property to "CheckedOut".

8. The `checkoutDevice()` function should update the borrower's name property.

9. The `checkoutDevice()` function should update the borrower's email property.

10. You should have a `checkinDevice(ledger, assetTag)` function that returns a confirmation string.

11. The `checkinDevice()` function should update the status property to "CheckedIn".

12. The `checkinDevice()` function should clear the values of the duedate and borrower's name and email properties.

13. You should have a `listOverdueDevices(ledger, today)` function that returns a new array of overdue entries sorted by due date.

14. The `listOverdueDevices()` function should only return assets with a dueDate past the `today` argument. Assets with a dueDate that is blank or in the future from `today` should not be returned.

15. The `listOverdueDevices()` function should return array items in order of `dueDate` with the latest dates (longest distance between the due date and today) being at the top.

16. You should implement a `serializeLedger(ledger)` function that is used at the beginning of checkoutDevice() and checkinDevice() functions.

17. You should implement a `loadLedger(json)` function that is used at the end of checkoutDevice() and checkinDevice().
