# --description--

Next, create a new variable called `dogsOnlySentence` and assign it `exampleSentence.replace("cats", "dogs")`.

Then below that variable, log to the console `"Replacing all occurrences of cats with dogs:"`. Below that `console.log()`, add another `console.log()` for the `dogsOnlySentence` variable. 

You should now see the text `"I love dogs and cats are so much fun!"` logged to the console. But that isn't the desired result. In the next step, you will learn how to fix it so the text reads `"I love dogs and dogs are so much fun!"`
