`Received` is the past participle of `receive`, which means to get or be given something. For example, `I received the report yesterday.`

`Take` can be used to ask for someone's opinion or viewpoint on a specific topic.

What's your take on it?` Here, `take` is used to ask for someone's opinion about whether the new programming language is indeed easier to learn compared to others. It's like asking, `Do you agree it's easier, and why do you think so?`
