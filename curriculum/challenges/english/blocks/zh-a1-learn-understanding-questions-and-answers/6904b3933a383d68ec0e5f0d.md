# --explanation--

`请问 (qǐng wèn)` is a polite phrase used to introduce a question. It translates to "excuse me" or "may I ask", and shows respect when you are about to ask something. It's often used with strangers or in formal situations. For example:

`请问你是刘明吗 (qǐng wèn nǐ shì liú míng ma)？` – Excuse me, are you Liu Ming?
