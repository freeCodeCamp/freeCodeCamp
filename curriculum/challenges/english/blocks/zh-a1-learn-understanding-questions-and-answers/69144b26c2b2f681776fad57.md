# --explanation--

`吗 (ma)` is a question particle. It's put at the end of a declarative sentence to turn it into a question, just like adding a question mark (?) to a sentence to make it a question.

Wang Hua is forming a question by adding `吗 (ma)` at the end of a declarative sentence `你是设计师 (nǐ shì shè jì shī)`. This indicates that she is asking for confirmation about Liu Ming's profession as a designer.
