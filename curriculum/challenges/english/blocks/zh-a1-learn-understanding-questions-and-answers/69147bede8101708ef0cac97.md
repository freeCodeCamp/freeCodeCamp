# --explanation--

Liu Ming says `是的 (shì de)`, which means "yes", to give a positive answer, and then says `我是 (wǒ shì) UI 设计师 (shè jì shī)`, which means "I am a UI designer" to confirm his profession.

Then, he asks `你呢 (nǐ ne)？`, which means "And you?". This is asking about Wang Hua's profession and keeping the conversation going.
