# --explanation--

`Does` is used as an auxiliary verb to form questions in the `Present Simple` tense for `he`, `she` and `it`. It is often used to ask for opinions or confirm something. For example:

- `Does he work on the app development team?` - This asks if he is part of the team working on the app.

- `Does she manage the database?` - This asks if she is responsible for handling the database.

- `How does that feature work on your system?` - By adding `How` to the sentence, this question asks for an explanation about a specific feature.

Lisa uses a question to ask for Bob's opinion about her new app idea. Pay attention to how she uses the question `How does that sound to you?` to find out what Bob thinks of the app concept.
