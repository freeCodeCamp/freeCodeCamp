<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: I'm struggling with these IDEs. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I'm BLANK with these IDEs.`

## --blanks--

`struggling`

### --feedback--

This word means to have difficulty with something. Remember to drop the `e` and add `-ing` to the end of the word.

# --explanation--

`To struggle` means to have difficulty with something. For example:

- `The program is struggling to load.` - This means the program is currently having difficulty loading.

The `Present Continuous` tense is used to describe actions that are **happening right now**.

In the example above, notice that when forming the `Present Continuous` tense with the verb `struggle`, the final `e` is dropped, resulting in `struggling`. This is a common rule for verbs that end in `e`.

In Tom's sentence, he uses the `Present Continuous` tense to describe his ongoing difficulty with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

You should add `-ing` to `struggle` because the action is happening right now.
