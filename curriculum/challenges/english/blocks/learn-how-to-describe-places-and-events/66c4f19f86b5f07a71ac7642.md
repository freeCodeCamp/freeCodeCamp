# --explanation--

Sarah mentions three things that will help you to help identify the issue. 

First, she says, `It should,` showing that the live preview is expected to work. Next, she states that it's `not displaying,` which indicates a problem. Finally, she suggests a reason: `the live server extension might not be running.` 

By connecting these clues, you can determine the probable reason Sarah provides for the issue.
