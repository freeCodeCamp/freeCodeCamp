# --explanation--

People sometimes show support indirectly without explicitly saying they agree. To understand if Anna supports Brian's idea, focus on her comment about the training.

Instead of directly saying she likes the idea, she mentions that using real-life scenarios `makes the training more relevant`. This shows she agrees with Brian because she highlights a positive result of using his suggestion. 

Pay attention to her choice of words and how they relate to the training.
