<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What could Sarah answer to Tom if she wanted to confirm that the Git tools are built-in?

## --answers--

`Yes, they are built-in, but you need to link your project to Git.`

---

`They might be built-in, but they don't work on all projects`.

### --feedback--

If you pick this option Sarah will be expressing uncertainty. She won't be confirming that the tools are built-in.
  
## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

When Tom asks if the Git tools are built-in, he is checking if they are included in Eclipse by default.

If Sarah wants to confirm that the Git tools are indeed built-in, she would respond in a way that reassures Tom that the tools should be there without needing to be added.
