# --explanation--

When Anna says, `Let's touch base again once the module is ready`, she is suggesting they reconnect after the module is finished.

In this context, `once` is used to indicate when something will happen in the future, meaning they will reconnect only after the module is ready. Pay attention to how `once` sets the timing for their next conversation.
