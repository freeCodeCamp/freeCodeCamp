<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Lisa: A couple of developers from our branch in Seattle, and a UX designer I've collaborated with before. Do you know if we have any similar projects coming up here?
Bob: Actually, we might.
-->

# --explanation--

`Might` is used to express possibility. It means that something is possible but not certain. For example:

- `I might go to the party if I finish my work.` - It's possible I will go, but I'm not sure.

- `She might call you later.` - It's possible she will call, but it's not certain.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

It is possible that there will be similar projects.

---

They have already finished the similar projects.

`Might` is about future possibilities, not about projects that are already finished.
