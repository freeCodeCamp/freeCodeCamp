<!-- Audio Reference:
Tom: The code auto-completion isn't popping up. Isn't it automatic? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which option is the best answer to Tom's question?

## --answers--

`It usually is, but it doesn't work if the project isn't set up right.`

---

`It is, you have to enable it manually every time.`

### --feedback--

This options is wrong because it contradicts itself. It starts saying `It is`, confirming Tom's question, but then it adds that auto-completion needs to be enabled manually every time. 

This doesn't make sense â€” if something is automatic, you wouldn't need to enable it manually.

# --explanation--

Tom says, `The code auto-completion isn't popping up. Isn't it automatic?` This means he expects auto-completion to work automatically. 

A good response would either confirm that auto-completion should be automatic or explain why it might not be working. 

Look for an answer that explains the feature should work automatically if the setup is correct.
