# --explanation--

Instead of directly saying she is free, Sarah uses the negative form `I'm not busy` to emphasize that she has time to help. 

This is a polite and indirect way to offer availability in English, commonly used to make the conversation more tactful.

Her follow-up sentence, `What's the problem?`, confirms she's willing to assist by inviting Tom to explain the issue.
