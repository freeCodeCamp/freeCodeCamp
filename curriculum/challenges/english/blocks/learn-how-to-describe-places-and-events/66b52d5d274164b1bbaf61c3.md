The `Present Continuous` tense is used to describe actions that are happening at the moment of speaking. It is formed using the verb `to be` (`am, is, are`) + the base form of the verb + `-ing`. For example:

- `She is coding a new feature right now.` - She is in the process of coding a new feature at this moment.

- `They are testing the software.` - They are in the middle of testing the software right now.
