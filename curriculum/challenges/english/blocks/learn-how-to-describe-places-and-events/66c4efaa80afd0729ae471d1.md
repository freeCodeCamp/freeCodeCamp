`Might` is used to express possibility. When Sarah says, `might not be running`, she's suggesting that it's possible the live server extension isn't currently active or working. For example:

- `The server might be down.` - It's possible the server isn't working.

- `She might not be available today.` - It's possible she's not free today.
