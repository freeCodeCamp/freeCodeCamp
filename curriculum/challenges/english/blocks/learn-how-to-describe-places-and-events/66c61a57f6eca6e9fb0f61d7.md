# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`And in Eclipse, it's not showing the Git tools. Are they BLANK?`

## --blanks--

`built-in`

### --feedback--

Something has been included as part of a larger system or structure from the start. This is a compound word, remember to use `-` between them. 

# --explanation--

`Built-in` refers to features or tools that are included as part of a software program or device from the start, without needing to be added or installed separately. 

When something is `built-in`, it's already there and ready to use. For example:

- `This laptop has a built-in camera.` - The camera is included as part of the laptop.

- `The software comes with built-in security features.` - The security features are already included in the software.
