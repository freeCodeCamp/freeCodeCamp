# --explanation--

When Listening to Sarah's, pay attention to the word `if`. This word often introduces the cause of a problem, explaining what needs to happen for something else to occur. 

After finding `if`, identify the part of the sentence that describes what happens when that condition isn't met (the effect). In Sarah's sentence:

- **Effect:** `The auto-completion doesn't work`.

- **Cause** introduced by `if`: `If the project isn't set up correctly`.

Understanding this relationship helps you explain problems and solutions clearly.
