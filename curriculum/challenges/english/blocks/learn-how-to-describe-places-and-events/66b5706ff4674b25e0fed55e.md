# --explanation--

When Brian says, `The team is working on it as we speak,` he uses the `Present Continuous` tense to show that the team is actively working on the project right now. 

`As we speak` means the work is happening at this very moment. This helps explain why he is confident that the project will be ready by the end of the week.

Pay attention to this phrase and how it shows that progress is being made, which is why Brian believes the project will be completed soon.
