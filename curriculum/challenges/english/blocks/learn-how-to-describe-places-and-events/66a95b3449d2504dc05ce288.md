<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Bob: Does your app have a potential name yet?
-->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Lisa's team has an idea for the app's name. How could she answer Bob's question?

## --answers--

`Yes, we are thinking of calling it "CollabReal."`

---

`Yes, the app is almost finished.`

### --feedback--

This answer does not address the question about the potential name of the app.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Potential` refers to something that is possible but not certain yet. Bob is asking if the app has a potential name.

The correct answer will be related to what the app could be called, not how far along it is in development.
