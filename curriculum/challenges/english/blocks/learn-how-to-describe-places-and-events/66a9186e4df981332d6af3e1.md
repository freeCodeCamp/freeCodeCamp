# --explanation--

Lisa clearly states her plans using the `Present Simple` tense. Pay attention to her answer `Yes, I am`, which directly confirms her attendance. 

Then, listen to her follow-up comments where she shares her expectations, using phrases like `it looks like` and `great event`, which show a positive expectation on the hackathon.
