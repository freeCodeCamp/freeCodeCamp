# --explanation--

People suggest times to meet and confirm if those times work for others. 

Listen to the words Bob says after `How about...`,
he says a specific time and day: `tomorrow during lunch`. 

Lisa responds with `works for me`, which is a casual way of saying the suggested time is convenient or acceptable. For example:

- Bob: `How about meeting at 3 PM?`, Lisa: `Works for me!` - This means Lisa is available to meet at 3PM.
