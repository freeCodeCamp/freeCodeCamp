# --explanation--

`It` is used to replace a noun that has already been mentioned, helping avoid repetition in a sentence. For example:

- `I bought a new laptop. It works really well.` - Here, `it` replaces `laptop` to avoid repeating the word.

In `The Live Preview isn't showing in Visual Studio Code. Isn't it supposed to support that feature?`, `it` refers to `Visual Studio Code` because Tom is talking about the program and its ability to support a feature. 

`It` replaces `Visual Studio Code` to avoid saying the program's name again. 

By identifying what is expected to support the feature, you can determine that `it` refers to the program itself.
