# --explanation--

To find the answer, pay attention to the word `but`, which signals a contrast or exception. 

After `but`, Sarah mentions `they're not visible`, followed by the condition `if the project isn't linked to Git.` 

This tells you that the tools are hidden unless the project is connected to Git. 

The phrase `if the project isn't` is a key marker that introduces the condition under which the Git tools won't appear.

In Sarah's sentence, she uses `they're not` to explain that the Git tools are not visible, and `isn't` to say that the project is not linked to Git.
