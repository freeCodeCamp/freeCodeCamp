# --explanation--

When Anna asks, `Do we cover this in our training?`, she uses the word `this` to refer to her previous concern about employees not using strong passwords. 

By connecting her question to the earlier sentence, `It concerns me that some employees might not be using strong passwords`, Anna is specifically asking if the training includes information on strong passwords.
