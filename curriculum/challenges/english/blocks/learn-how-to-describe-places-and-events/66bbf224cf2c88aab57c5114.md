# --explanation--

`Supposed to` is used to express something that is expected or assumed to happen, based on a plan, rule, or expectation. For example:

- `The project is supposed to be finished by Friday.` - This means it is expected to be completed by that time.

In Tom's sentence, he uses `supposed to` to talk about an expected feature in Visual Studio Code, suggesting that it should support the feature.
