# --description--

A `desk` is often the central part of one's workspace, especially in an office setting. People typically use it to set up their computers, write, read, and do other work-related tasks.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is a common activity people might do with their desk at the start of a workday?

## --answers--

Water it like a plant

### --feedback--

A `desk` is not a plant. It doesn't need water to grow.

---

Organize and tidy it

---

Cook food on it

### --feedback--

A `desk` is used for working, not cooking. It isn't heat-resistant like stovetops.

---

Wear it like clothing

### --feedback--

A `desk` is a furniture item, not a wearable object. You can't put on a desk like a shirt or pants.
