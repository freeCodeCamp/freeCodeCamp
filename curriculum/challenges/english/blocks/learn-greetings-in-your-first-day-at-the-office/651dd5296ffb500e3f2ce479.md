# --description--

In English, contractions are commonly used to make speech sound more natural and fluent. `You're` is a contraction of `you are`. 

This contraction is a combination of the pronoun `you` and the verb `are`, which is part of the verb `to be`. `Are` is used here in the present affirmative to make a statement or ask a question. This is a typical way to confirm someone's role or identity in English.
