# --description--

In English, we use names to directly refer to specific people. See this example: 

`Hello! You're Amy, correct?`

In English, names directly refer to specific people. Saying `Amy` identifies a particular person with that name. Using `the` or `an` before a name, like `the Amy` or `an Amy`, sounds unusual because names are already unique and specific.
 
Think of names as unique labels for people. So, you don't need `a`, `an`, or `the` before a person's name. Just use the name by itself!
