# --description--

Jake provides an answer using `it isn't`, which is a contraction of `it is not`. It's a way to negate or say "no" to a statement or question. Contractions are a way to combine words for more natural speech. For example:

- Question: `Is the software updated?`

- Answer: `No, it isn't updated.` or `No, it is not updated.`

Jake also uses `it's`, the contraction for `it is`, when talking about the swipe card system. Let's see how well you understand these in the context of the dialogue.
