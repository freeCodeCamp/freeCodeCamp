## --text--

After talking with Tom, Alice sent a text message to her mom:

`Hey Mom, I've decided to switch jobs! I want to find a company with the best work-life balance and good career growth opportunities. I talked to my friend Tom, and he gave me a lot to think about. He told me about a few companies. One has the most structured training programs, another offers the highest salaries, and one has the most laid-back culture. That's interesting because I never thought so much about these differences before.`

`I think I'd really enjoy working in a place with a creative and relaxed environment. I also want a job that lets me grow but still gives me time for myself. Good to know there are companies that offer both!`
