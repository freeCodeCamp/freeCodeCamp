# --explanation--

`More efficient` means completing tasks while using fewer resources, such as time or energy. For example:  

`This new software is more efficient because it loads pages faster and uses less memory.` - This means the software performs better while using fewer system resources.

`Processing` refers to how a computer or system handles and completes tasks. For example:  

`Faster processing allows applications to run smoothly without delays.` - Here, `processing` means how quickly the system can handle tasks.
