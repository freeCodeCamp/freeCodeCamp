Sophie emailed her team about choosing SafeGuard for their project:  

`Hi team,` 

`After talking with Jake, I've decided to go with SafeGuard. While SecureSoft is more user-friendly and has a nicer interface, security is our top priority. SafeGuard has stronger encryption and better protection against vulnerabilities, so it's the safer choice.`

`SafeGuard is also slightly faster because of its more efficient processing. SecureSoft can be a bit sluggish with large data. The only downside is that SecureSoft has more integration options, while SafeGuard may require extra work to connect with other tools.`

`Thanks for your input! Let me know if you have any concerns. It's no problem if we need to discuss this more.`

`Yours,`

`Sophie`
