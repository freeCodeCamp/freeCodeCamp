# --explanation--

Jake describes two aspects of the software.

- `Stronger encryption` means the data is more securely encoded, making it harder for attackers to access.

- `Better protection against vulnerabilities` means the software has improved defenses against weaknesses that could be exploited.

These mean that the software provides enhanced security features.
