`Performance` refers to how well something functions, especially in terms of speed and efficiency. For example:  

`This computer has better performance because it processes data quickly.` - Here, `performance` means how efficiently the computer works.  

`Faster` is the comparative form of `fast`, meaning something moves or operates at a higher speed than another. For example:  

`This new software runs faster than the old version.` - Here, `faster` means the new software operates more quickly.
