## --sentence--

`It has BLANK BLANK and better protection against vulnerabilities.`

## --blanks--

`stronger`

`encryption`

### --feedback--

This refers to a method of protecting data by converting it into a secure code.

# --explanation--

`Stronger` is the comparative form of `strong`, meaning something has greater power or effectiveness. For example:

`This password is stronger than the previous one because it has special characters.` - This means current password is harder to break compared to the previous password.

`Encryption` refers to converting data into a secure format to prevent unauthorized access. For example:

`End-to-end encryption keeps messages private by encoding them so only the sender and receiver can read them.` - Here, `encryption` means the process of securing information by converting it into a coded form.
