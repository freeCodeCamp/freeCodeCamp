`in-house`

### --feedback--

This means doing the work within the company instead of outsourcing it. This is a compound word. Remember to use `-`.

# --explanation--

`Build the software` means to create and develop a program or application from scratch. It involves coding, designing, and testing the software. For example:

`The company wants to build the software from the ground up using Python.` – This means they will develop the software entirely from the beginning using Python.  

`In-house` means that the work is done within the company rather than hiring an external team or outsourcing the project. For example:

`Our team decided to do front-end development in-house instead of hiring an external agency.` – This means the company's own employees will handle the front-end development instead of outsourcing it.
