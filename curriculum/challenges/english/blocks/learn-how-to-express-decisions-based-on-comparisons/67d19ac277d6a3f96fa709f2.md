`best`

### --feedback--

This word is the superlative form of `good`, used to describe something that is better than everything else.

# --explanation--

`Best` is a superlative adjective, which means it is used to compare three or more things and show the top degree of quality. For example:

`This is the best laptop I have ever used.` - This means no other laptop is better.

Superlative is used to show the extreme degree of a quality among three or more items. 

It's formed by:

- Adding `-est` to short adjectives, like `smallest`.  

- Using `most` before longer adjectives (usually with two or more syllables), like `most expensive`.

Some adjectives have irregular superlatives, like the superlative of `good` is `best`.

Always use `the` before a superlative to specify it is the top in its group, like `the fastest processor` or `the most secure system`.
