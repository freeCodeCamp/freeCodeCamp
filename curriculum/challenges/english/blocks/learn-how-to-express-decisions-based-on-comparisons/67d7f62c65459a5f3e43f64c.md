`Makes sense` means that something is logical or understandable. For example:

`Using version control makes sense because it helps track changes in the code.` – This means version control is a logical choice for managing code changes.  

`So` is used to introduce a conclusion based on what was just discussed. For example:

`The server is down, so we need to restart it.` – This means that restarting the server is a logical next step because the server is down.

`If` is used to introduce a condition that affects the outcome. For example:

`If we optimize the database, the application will run faster.` – This means improving the database will lead to better app performance.
