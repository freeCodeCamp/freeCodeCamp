`better`

### --feedback--

This word is the comparative form of `good` and is used when comparing two options. It shows that one is superior in quality or performance.

# --explanation--

`Better` is the comparative form of `good` used when comparing two things.

In comparative form, adjectives or adverbs with one syllable usually add `-er` (like `stronger` and `faster`) in the end.

Longer adjectives or adverbs use `more` (like `more interesting` and `more efficiently`). `More` is a comparative term used to indicate a greater amount, quantity, degree, or number of something in relation to another. 

Some words have irregular comparative form, like `good` changes to `better`. For example:

`Cloud storage is better than local storage for remote access.` â€“ This means cloud storage supports remote access, while local storage lacks or is not good in this capability.
