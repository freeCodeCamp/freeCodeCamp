# --description--

The user qualifies for a membership discount if their age is greater than equal to 21 and they are a member. 

In Python, the `and` operator is used to check if multiple conditions are true or not.

```py
if condition1 and condition2:
    # execute this block of code if all conditions are true
else:
    # else execute this block of code
```

Write an `if-else` statement that checks if the `age` is `greater than or equal to 21` and `is_member`. 

If both conditions are true, print `User qualifies for membership discount`. Otherwise, print `User does not qualify for membership discount`.

# --hints--

You should use the `and` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to compare `age` with `21`.

```js

```

You should use `is_member` as the second condition.

```js

```

You should print `User qualifies for membership discount` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should print `User does not qualifies for membership discount` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
