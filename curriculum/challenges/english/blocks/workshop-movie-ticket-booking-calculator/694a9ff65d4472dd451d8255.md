In this workshop, you’ll practice how to use booleans and conditional statements in Python by building a Movie Ticket Booking Calculator.

Begin by declaring variables that store basic information about the user and the movie show.

Create the following variables with the specified values:

- `base_price` set to `500` 
- `age` set to `21` 
- `show_time` set to `'Evening'` 
- `is_weekend` set to `True` 
- `is_member` set to `False`
