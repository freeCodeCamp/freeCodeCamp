# --description--

In this workshop, you will practice how to use booleans and conditional statements in Python by building a movie ticket booking calculator.

Begin by declaring variables that store information about the user and the movie show.

As you learned in previous lessons, variables are assigned using the assignment operator (`=`) this way:

```py
# Assigns the value 10 to variable x
x = 10
```

Create a variable named `base_price` to store the base price of movie ticket and set its value to `15`. Create another variable named `age` to store the user's age and set its value to `21`.

# --hints--

You should declare a variable named `base_price`.

```js

```

You should assign the integer value `15` to `base_price`.

```js

```

You should declare a variable named `age`.

```js

```

You should assign the integer value `21` to `age`.

```js

```
