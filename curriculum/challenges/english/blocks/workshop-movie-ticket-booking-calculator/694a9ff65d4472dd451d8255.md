# --description--

In this workshop, you’ll practice how to use booleans and conditional statements in Python by building a Movie Ticket Booking Calculator.

Begin by declaring variables that store basic information about the user and the movie show.

Create the following variables with the specified values:

- `base_price` to store the base price of movie ticket and set its value to `500`
- `age` to store the user's age and set its value to `21`
- `show_time` to store the time of the movie show and set its value to `'Evening'` 
- `is_weekend` to indicate whether the movie show is on a weekend and set its value to `True` 
- `is_member` to indicate whether the user is a member and set its value to `False`
