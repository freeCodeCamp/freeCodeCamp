# --description--

In Python, the `and` operator is used to check if multiple conditions are `True`. Here's how you can use it to combine two conditions in an `if` statement:

```py
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are True
```

The membership discount should only apply to members if their `age` is greater than or equal to `21`.

Use the `and` operator to combine the existing condition of your `if` statement with another condition checking if `age` is greater than or equal to `21`.

# --hints--

You should use the `and` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should check if `is_member` is `True`.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to check `age` with `21`.

```js

```

```py
base_price = 15
age = 21
seat_type = 'Gold'
show_time = 'Evening'

if age > 18:
    print('User is eligible to book a ticket')

if age >= 21:
    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

is_member = True
is_weekend = False

discount = 0
--fcc-editable-region--
if is_member:
--fcc-editable-region--
    discount = 3
    print('User qualify for membership discount')
else:
    print('User does not qualify for membership discount')
print('Discount:', discount)
```
