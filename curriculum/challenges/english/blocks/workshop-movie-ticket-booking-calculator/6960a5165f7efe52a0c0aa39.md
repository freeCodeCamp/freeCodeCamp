# --description--

The membership discount should only apply to members if their `age` is greater than or equal to `21`. In Python, the `and` operator is used to check if multiple conditions are `True`.

```py
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are True
else:
    # Code to execute if at least one condition is False
```

Update your `if` statement condition to check if `age` is greater than or equal to `21` and `is_member` is `True` using the `and` operator.

# --hints--

You should use the `and` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should check if `is_member` is `True`.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to check `age` with `21`.

```js

```
