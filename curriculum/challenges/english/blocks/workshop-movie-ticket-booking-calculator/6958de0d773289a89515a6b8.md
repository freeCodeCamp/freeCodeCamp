# --description--

In the previous step, you checked a condition using an `if` statement. The `else` clause is used to handle the case in which the condition is false.

```py
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
```

In this step, you will check whether the user is allowed to book an evening show based on their age.

Create an `if` statement to check if `age` is greater than or equal to `21`. Inside the body of the `if` statement, print `User is eligible for Evening shows`.

Then, add an `else` clause that prints `User is not eligible for Evening shows`.

# --hints--

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to compare `age` with `21`.

```js

```

You should print `User is eligible for Evening shows` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should have an `else` statement.

```js

```

You should print `User is not eligible for Evening shows` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
