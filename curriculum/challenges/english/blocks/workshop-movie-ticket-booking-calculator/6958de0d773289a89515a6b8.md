# --description--

Now you will check whether the user is allowed to book an evening show based on their age.

Create an `if` statement to check if `age` is greater than or equal to `21`. Inside the body of the `if` statement, print `User is eligible for Evening shows`.

# --hints--

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to compare `age` with `21`.

```js

```

You should print `User is eligible for Evening shows` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
base_price = 15
age = 21
seat_type = 'Gold'
show_time = 'Evening'

if age > 18:
    print('User is eligible to book a ticket')
