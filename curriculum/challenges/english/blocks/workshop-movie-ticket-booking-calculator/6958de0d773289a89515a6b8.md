# --description--

In the previous step, you checked a condition using an `if` statement. The `if...else` statement is used to handle both the true and false outcomes of a condition.

```py
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
```

In this step, you will check whether the user is allowed to book an evening show based on their age.

You should use the `if...else` statement to check if `age` is greater than or equal to `21`.

You should print `User is eligible for Evening shows` when the conditon is `True`. Otherwise, print `User is not eligible for Evening shows`.

Check the output in the terminal.

# --hints--

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to compare `age` with `21`.

```js

```

You should print `User is eligible for Evening shows` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should have an `else` statement.

```js

```

You should print `User is not eligible for Evening shows` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
