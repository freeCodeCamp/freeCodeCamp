# --description--

In the previous step, you checked a condition using an `if` statement. The `else` clause is used to handle the case when the condition is false. Here's the syntax of an `if...else` statement:

```py
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if condition is False
```

Now, add an `else` clause to your `if` statement and print `User is not eligible for Evening shows`. This will print only when the condition in the `if` statement is false.

# --hints--
