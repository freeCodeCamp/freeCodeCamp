# --description--

There are extra charges for the movie ticket if the show is in the evening or if it is a weekend.

In Python, the `or` operator is used to check whether at least one condition is `True`.

```py
if condition1 or condition2:
    # Code to execute if any condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```

First create a variable named `extra_charges` and set it to `0`. Then, you should use the `if...else` statement to check if `show_time` is equal to `'Evening'` or `is_weekend` is `True`.

If either condition is true, you should update `extra_charges` value to `2` and print `Extra charges will be applied` in the terminal.

Otherwise, print `No extra charges will be applied`.

# --hints--

You should declare a variable named `extra_charges`.

```js

```

You should assign the integer value `0` to `extra_charges`.

```js

```

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `or` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should assign `2` to `extra_charges` inside `if` block.

```js

```

You should print `Extra charges will be applied` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should have an `else` statement.

```js

```

You should print `No extra charges will be applied` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
