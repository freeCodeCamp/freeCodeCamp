# --description--

You should also handle the case when the user does not qualify for a membership discount.

Add an `else` clause to your `if` statement and print `User does not qualify for membership discount`.

You can print a message followed by a variable like this:

```py
print('Total:', total)
```

You should display the updated value of `discount`. Below the `if...else` statement, use the `print()` function to display the message that shows `Discount:` followed by the value of `discount`.

Check the output in the terminal.
