# --description--

In Python, an `if` statement is used to check whether a condition is `True`. If it is, the code inside the `if` block runs.

```py
if condition:
    # execute the block of code
```

In this step, you will check if the user is eligible to book a movie ticket based on their age.

Write an `if` statement to check if `age` is `greater than or equal to 18` and print `User is eligible to book a ticket` when the condition is true. Remember to indent the code inside the `if` statement.

# --hints--
