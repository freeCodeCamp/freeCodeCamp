# --description--

Now you need to store some string values about the movie ticket. You can store strings in Python this way:

```py
name = 'Alice'
```

Create a variable named `seat_type` to store the type of seat the user has selected and set its value to the string `Gold`. Create another variable named `show_time` to store the show time of the movie and set its value to the string `Evening`.

Remember to surround both values with either single or double quotes.

# --hints--

You should declare a variable named `seat_type`.

```js

```

You should assign the string `Gold` to `seat_type`. Remember to surround the value with either single or double quotes.

```js

```

You should declare a variable named `show_time`.

```js

```

You should assign the string `Evening` to `show_time`. Remember to surround the value with either single or double quotes.
