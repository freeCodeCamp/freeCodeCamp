# --description--

Now you need to store some string values about the movie ticket. You can store strings in Python this way:

```py
name = 'Alice'
```

Create a variable named `seat_type` to store the type of seat the user has selected and set its value to `Gold`. Create another variable named `show_time` to store the show time of the movie and set its value to `'Evening'`.

Remember to surround the value with either single or double quotes.

# --hints--
