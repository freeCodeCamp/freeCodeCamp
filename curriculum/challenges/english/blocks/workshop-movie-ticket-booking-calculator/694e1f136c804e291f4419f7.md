# --description--

In the previous step, you checked a condition using an `if` statement. In this step, you will use an `if-else` statement to handle both the true and false outcomes of a condition.

```py
if condition:
    If true execute this block code
else:
    Else execute this block code
```

In this step, you will check whether the user is allowed to book an Evening show based on their age.

Write an `if-else` statement to check if `age` is `greater than or equal` to `21`.
If the condition is true, print `User is eligible for Evening shows`. Otherwise, print `User is not eligible for Evening shows`.

Check the output in the console.

# --hints--

You should use an `if` statement to check the condition.

```js

```

You should use `>=` operator to compare `age` with `21`.

```js

```

You should use an `else` statement to handle the case when the condition is false.

```js

```

You should print `User is eligible for Evening shows` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should print `User is not eligible for Evening shows` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
