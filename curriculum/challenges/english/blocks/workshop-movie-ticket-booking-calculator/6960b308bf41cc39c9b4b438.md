# --description--

Extra charges should also apply if the show is in the evening. In Python, the `or` operator is used to check whether at least one condition is `True`.

```py
if condition1 or condition2:
    # Code to execute if any condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```

Now, add another condition to your `if` statement to check if `show_time` is equal to `'Evening'` using the `or` operator.

# --hints--

You should use the `or` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should check if `is_weekend` is `True`.

```js

```

You should use the `==` operator to check if `show_time` is `'Evening'`.

```js

```

if age > 18:

if age >= 21:
    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

if is_member and age >= 21:

else:
    print('User does not qualify for membership discount')
print('Discount:', discount)
