# --description--

In Python, the `or` operator is used to check whether at least one of two conditions is true. Here's how you can use it in an `if` statement:

```py
if condition1 or condition2:
    # Code to execute if any condition is True
```

Extra charges should also apply if the show is in the evening. Use the `or` operator to combine the existing condition of your `if` statement with a second condition checking if `show_time` is equal to the string `Evening`.

# --hints--

You should use the `or` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should check if `is_weekend` is `True`.

```js

```

You should use the `==` operator to check if `show_time` is `'Evening'`.

```js

```

base_price = 15
age = 21
seat_type = 'Gold'
show_time = 'Evening'

if age > 18:
    print('User is eligible to book a ticket')

if age >= 21:
    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

is_member = False
is_weekend = False

discount = 0
if is_member and age >= 21:
    discount = 3
    print('User qualify for membership discount')
else:
    print('User does not qualify for membership discount')
print('Discount:', discount)
