# --description--

As you learned in previous lessons, in Python, an `if` statement can be used to run code depending on if a condition is true.

An `if` statement consists of the `if` keyword, followed by a condition and a colon. The code to run when the condition is true, which must be indented, is called the body of the `if` statement.

```py
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
```

In this step, you will check if the user is eligible to book a movie ticket based on their age.

Create an `if` statement to check if `age` is greater than `18`. Inside the `if` block, print `User is eligible to book a ticket`. This will print the message only when the user's age is greater than `18`.

Remember to indent the body of the `if` statement and surround the message with single or double quotes inside the `print()` function.

# --hints--

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `>` operator to compare `age` with `18`.

```js 

```

You should have a `print()` function inside the `if` block.

```js

```

The message printed should be `User is eligible to book a ticket`.

```js

```
