# --description--

In Python, an `if` statement is used to check whether a condition is `True`. If it is, the code inside the `if` block runs.

```py
if condition:
    # Code to execute if condition is True
```

In this step, you will check if the user is eligible to book a movie ticket based on their age.

You should use an `if` statement to check if `age` is greater than `18` and print `User is eligible to book a ticket` to the terminal when the condition is `True`.

Remember to indent the code inside the `if` block and surround the message with single or double quotes inside the `print()` function.

Check the output in the terminal.
