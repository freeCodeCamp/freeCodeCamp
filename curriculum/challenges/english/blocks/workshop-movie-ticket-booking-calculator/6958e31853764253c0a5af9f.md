# --description--

When multiple logical operators are used in an `if` statement, conditions joined with `and` are evaluated before conditions joined with `or`. Parentheses `()` are used in Python to group conditions and control the order in which they are evaluated.

In the code given below, the expression inside the parentheses `()` will be evaluated first, before combining with conditions outside.

```py
if condition1 and (condition2 or condition3):
    # Code to execute if conditions evaluate to True
else:
    # Code to execute if conditions evaluate to False
```

Now you will check if the age satisfies the ticket book conditions. The conditions for ticket booking are:

- `age` is greater than or equal to `21`, or
- `age` is greater than 18, and
- either `show_time` is not `Evening` or user is a `member`

You should use the `is...else` statement to check the conditions and print `Booking conditions satisfied` in the terminal if condition is `True`. Otherwise, you should print `Ticket booking failed due to restrictions`.

# --hints--

You should declare a variable named `extra_charges`.

```js

```

You should assign the integer value `0` to `extra_charges`.

```js

```

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `or` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should assign `2` to `extra_charges` inside `if` block.

```js

```

You should print `Extra charges will be applied` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should have an `else` statement.

```js

```

You should print `No extra charges will be applied` inside the `else` block.

```js

```

```py
base_price = 15
age = 21

seat_type = 'Gold'
show_time = 'Evening'

is_member = True
is_weekend = False

if age > 18:
    print('User is eligible to book a ticket')

if age >= 21:
    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

discount = 0
if age >= 21 and is_member:
    discount = 3
    print('User qualify for membership discount')
else:
    print('User does not qualify for membership discount')
print('Discount:', discount)

extra_charges = 0
if show_time == 'Evening' or is_weekend:
    extra_charges = 2
    print('Extra charges will be applied')
else:
    print('No extra charges will be applied')
print('Extra charges:', extra_charges)
