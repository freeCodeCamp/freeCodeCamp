# --description--

The user has to pay extra charges if the show is in the Evening or if it is a weekend.

In Python, the `or` operator is used to check whether at least one condition is true.

```py
if condition1 or condition2:
    # execute this block code if any condition is true
else:
    # else execute this block code
```

Write an `if-else` statement that checks if `show_time` is equal to `'Evening'` or `is_weekend` is `True`.

If either condition is true, print `Extra charges will be applied`. Otherwise, print `No extra charges will be applied`.

Check the output in the console.

# --hints--

You should use the `or` operator to check both conditions.

```js

```

You should compare `show_time` with `'Evening'`.

```js

```

You should use `is_weekend` as the second condition.

```js

```

You should print `Extra charges will be applied` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should print `No extra charges will be applied` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
