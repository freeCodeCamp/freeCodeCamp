# --description--

The `if...elif...else` statement is used to check multiple conditions in order.

```py
if condition1:
   # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
   # Code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
   # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```

In this step, you will calculate service charges based on the type of seat the user has selected.

First, create a variable named `service_charges` and set it to `0`.

Then, you should use the `if...elif...else` statement to calculate the service charges based on `seat_type`:

- If `seat_type` is `Premium`, assign `5` to `service_charges`
- Else if `seat_type` is `Gold`, assign `3` to `service_charges`
- Otherwise, assign `1` to `service_charges`

Finally, print a message that shows `Service charges:` followed by the value of `service_charges`.

# --hints--

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use `==` operator to compare `seat_type` with `Premium`.

```js

```

You should assign `5` to `service_charges` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should use the `elif` statement to compare `seat_type` with `Gold`.

```js

```

You should assign `3` to `service_charges` inside the `elif` block.

```js

```

You should assign `1` to `service_charges` inside the `else` block.

```js

```

You should print the message below the `if...elif...if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the label `Service charges:` as first argument.

```js

```

You should use the `service_charges` variable as second argument.

```js

```

if age > 18:
    print('User is eligible to book a ticket')

    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

is_member = False

if is_member and age >= 21:
    discount = 3
    print('User qualify for membership discount')
else:
    print('User does not qualify for membership discount')
print('Discount:', discount)

extra_charges = 0
if is_weekend or show_time == 'Evening':
    extra_charges = 2
    print('Extra charges will be applied')
else:
    print('No extra charges will be applied')
print('Extra charges:', extra_charges)

if age >= 21 or age > 18 and (show_time != 'Evening' or is_member):
    print('Ticket booking condition satisfied')
