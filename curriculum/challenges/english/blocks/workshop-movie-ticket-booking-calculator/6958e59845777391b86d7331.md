# --description--

In this step, you will calculate service charges based on the type of seat the user has selected.

The `if...elif...else` statement is used to check multiple conditions in order.

```py
if condition1:
   # Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
   # Code to execute if condition2 is True
else:
   # Code to execute if all conditions are False
```

First, create a variable `service_charges` and set it to `0`.

Then, you should use the `if...elif...else` statement to calculate the service charge based on `seat_type`:

- If `seat_type` is `'Premium'`, assign `5` to `service_charges`
- Else if `seat_type` is `'Gold'`, assign `3` to `service_charges`
- Otherwise, assign `1` to `service_charges`

Finally, print a message that shows `Service charges: ` followed by the value of `service_charges`.

# --hints--

You should use `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use `==` operator to check `seat_type` with `Premium`.

```js

```

You should assign the correct value to `service_charges` in each block.

```js

```

You should use `elif` statement to check if `seat_type` is `'Gold'`.

```js

```

You should use `else` to assign `service_charges` for any other seat type.

```js

```

You should print the `service_charges` below the `if...elif...if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the label `Service charges:` as first argument.

```js

```

You should use the `service_charges` variable as second argument.

```js

```

if age > 18:
    print('User is eligible to book a ticket')

if age >= 21:
    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

discount = 0
if age >= 21 and is_member:
    discount = 3
    print('User qualify for membership discount')
else:
    print('User does not qualify for membership discount')
print('Discount:', discount)

extra_charges = 0
if show_time == 'Evening' or is_weekend:
    extra_charges = 2
    print('Extra charges will be applied')
else:
    print('No extra charges will be applied')
print('Extra charges:', extra_charges)

if age >= 21 or (age > 18 and (show_time != 'Evening' or is_member)):
    print('Ticket booking condition satisfied')
