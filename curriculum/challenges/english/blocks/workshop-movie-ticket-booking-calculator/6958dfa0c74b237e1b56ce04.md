# --description--

The user qualify for a membership discount if their age is greater than or equal to 21 and they are a member.

In Python, the `and` operator is used to check if multiple conditions are `True`.

```py
if condition1 and condition2:
    # Code to execute if all conditions are True
else:
    # Code to execute if at least one condition is False
```

First, create a variable named `discount` and set its value to `0`. This will store the discount the user gets on the movie ticket.

Then you should use the `if-else` statement that checks if the `age` is greater than or equal to `21` and `is_member` is `True`.

You should update the `discount` value to `3` if both the conditions are `True` and print `User qualify for membership discount` to the terminal.

Otherwise, print `User does not qualify for membership discount` to the terminal.

Check the output in the terminal.

# --hints--

You should assign the integer value `0` to `discount`.

You should have an `if` statement.

You should use the `and` operator to check both conditions.

```js

You should assign `3` to `discount` inside `if` block.

```js

```

You should print `User qualify for membership discount` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should have an `else` statement.

```js

```

You should print `User does not qualify for membership discount` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
