# --description--

In this final step, you will calculate the final price of the movie ticket using the values calculated in the previous steps.

The final ticket price is calculated by adding the extra charges and service charges to the base price, and then subtracting the discount.

Calculate the final price of the ticket and store it in a variable named `final_price`.

Finally, print a message that shows `Final price of ticket:` followed by the value of `final_price`.

# --hints--

You should declare a variable named `final_price`.

```js

```

You should add the value of `extra_charges` and `service_charges` to the `base_price`.

```js

```

You should subtract the value of `discount` from the `base_price`.

```js

```

You should use the `print()` function to print the value of `final_price`.

```js

```

You should use label `Final price of ticket:` as first argument.

```js

```

You should use the `final_price` variable as second argument.

```js

```
