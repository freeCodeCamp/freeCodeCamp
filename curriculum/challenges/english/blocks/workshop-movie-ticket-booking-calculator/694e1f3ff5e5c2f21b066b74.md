# --description--

When multiple logical operators are used in an `if` statement, conditions joined with `and` are evaluated before conditions joined with `or`.

Parentheses `()` are used in Python to group conditions and control the order in which they are evaluated.

In the code below, the expression inside the parentheses will be evaluated first, before combining with conditions outside.

```py
if condition1 and (condition2 or condition3):
    # execute this block of code
else:
    # else execute this block of code
```

Write a `if-else` statement to check if

if age >= 21:
    print('User is eligible for Evening shows')
else:
    print('User is not eligible for Evening shows')

if age >= 21 and is_member:

if show_time == 'Evening' or is_weekend:
    print('Extra charges will be applied')
