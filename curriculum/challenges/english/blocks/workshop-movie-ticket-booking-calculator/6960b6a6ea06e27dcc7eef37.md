# --description--

Now you will check if the user satisfies the conditions to book a movie ticket. Users with age `21` or above can always book tickets without any restrictions.

Create an `if` statement to check if `age` is greater than or equal to `21`. Inside the body of `if` statement, print `Ticket booking condition satisfied` to the terminal.

Then, add an `else` clause to your `if` statement and print `Ticket booking failed due to restrictions` inside the body of `else` statement.

# --hints--

You should have an `if` statement.

```js

```

You should use the `>=` operator to compare `age` with `21`.

```js

```

You should print `Ticket booking condition satisfied` inside the `if` block.

```js

```

You should have an `else` statement.

```js

```

You should print `Ticket booking failed due to restrictions` inside the `else` block.

```js

```
