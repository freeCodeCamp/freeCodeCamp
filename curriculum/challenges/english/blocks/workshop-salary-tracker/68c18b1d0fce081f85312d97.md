# --description--

In a previous lecture, you learned that an attribute prefixed with a single underscore is meant for internal use by convention.

Modify both `name` and `level` attributes into `_name` and `_level`.

Note that this does not prevent the attribute from being accessed or modified outside the class. Also, there's always a way to access private attributes (prefixed with a double underscore) as well.

# --hints--

Your `__init__` method should set `self._name` to `name`.

```js

```

Your `__init__` method should set `self._level` to `level`.

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
--fcc-editable-region--
class Employee:
    def __init__(self, name, level):
        self.name = name
        self.level = level

charlie_brown = Employee('Charlie Brown', 'trainee')
--fcc-editable-region--
```
