<!-- (Audio) Bob: Absolutely. I've been passionate about photography for many years. -->

# --description--

In Bob's sentence, you see a different structure being introduced. Instead of saying `I am passionate about photography`, Bob uses `I've been passionate about  photography`. This has to do with the expression that comes right after, `for many years`.

When you see `'ve been` in a sentence, remember it is a contraction of the verb `have`, which becomes `'ve`, and the verb `to be` in the *participle* form. 

For example: `I've been in love with Jane for a long time now, but she just likes me as a friend.`

Fill in the blanks with the correct forms of the verbs `have` and `be`, according to what Bob says.
