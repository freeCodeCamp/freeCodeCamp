<!-- (Audio) Bob: Absolutely. I've been passionate about photography for many years. -->

# --description--

In Bob's sentence, you see a new structure: `I've been passionate about photography`.

Normally, you say: `I am passionate about photography`. But Bob adds time: `for many years`. That's why he uses `I've been` instead of just `I am`.

This structure uses the verb `to be` in the **participle** form: `been`. You can use this when you want to talk about something that started in the past and is still true now.

`I've been` is a short form of `I have been`. Here's another example:

`I've been interested in coding since high school.` - This means you started coding in high school, and you're still interested now.
