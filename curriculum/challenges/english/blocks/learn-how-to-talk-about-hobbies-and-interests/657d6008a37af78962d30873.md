<!-- (Audio) Maria: How long have you been into photography? -->

# --description--

In the beginning of the dialogue, Maria says `Are you into photography?` to ask if Bob likes photography. Now that she knows he does, she asks `How long have you been into photography?` to know the amount of time that has passed since he started enjoying it. 

Since the question is about duration from the past up until the present, you use the `Present Perfect` tense. 

Remember that the form of the verb `to be` for the `present perfect` is `been`. For example, `I have been in a traffic jam for an hour`.

`How long...?` is used to ask questions related to duration. For example:

`How long have they been testing the new app?` - This question is about the duration of testing.
