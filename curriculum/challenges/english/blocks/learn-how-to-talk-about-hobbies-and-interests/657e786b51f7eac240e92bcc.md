# --description--

The phrase `would you like` is a polite way to offer something or ask someone if they want something. When offering something, you can specify it directly after the expression `would you like`. 

For instance, you might ask `Would you like some coffee?` when offering coffee to a guest.

If you are proposing to do something, such as `going shopping`, remember to include `to` between the expression and the action. 

For example: `Would you like to go shopping?`.
Finally, if you are asking someone if you should do something for them, use `me` between `would you like` and `to`. For example: `Would you like me to make some coffee?`.
