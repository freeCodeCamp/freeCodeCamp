<!-- (Audio) Bob: So I always recommend starting with the basics, learning about your camera, and trying to have fun. -->

# --description--

You say you `recommend` that someone does something when you tell this person that what you suggest is a good, maybe the best choice for them. For example: `I recommend that you read this book. It's the best on the topic.` When you have actions following the verb `recommend`, use them in the `-ing` form. For example: `I recommend reading this book if you want to understand this topic better.`

# --questions--

---

Concentrating on the basic things, learning about the camera you use, and enjoying what you do.

Trying photography and abandoning if you see it's not for you.
