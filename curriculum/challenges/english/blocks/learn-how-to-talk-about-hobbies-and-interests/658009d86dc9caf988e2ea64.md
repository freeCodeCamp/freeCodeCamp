<!-- (Audio) Brian: Hey, Sophie. I heard you're into extreme sports. Is that true? -->

# --description--

`Extreme` means something is very great in degree or intensity, much more than usual. For example, if it's very, very hot outside, you might say, `The heat today is extreme`. This means it's much hotter than what is normal.

`Extreme sports` refer to activities that involve a high degree of risk, often involving speed, height, or physical exertion.
