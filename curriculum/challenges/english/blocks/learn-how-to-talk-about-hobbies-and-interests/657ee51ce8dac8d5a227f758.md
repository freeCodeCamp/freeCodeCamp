<!-- (Audio) James: That's awesome. What kind of figures are you most interested in? -->

# --description--

`Most` is often used to show the highest degree or the greatest amount of something. For example:

`Out of all my hobbies, I enjoy reading the most.` - This means that you might have many hobbies, but reading is your favorite.

To be `interested in` means you want to know more about something or you like learning or doing it. For example:

`I am interested in painting.` - This means you like painting or enjoy learning about it.
