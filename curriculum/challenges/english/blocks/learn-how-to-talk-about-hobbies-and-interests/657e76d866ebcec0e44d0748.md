<!-- (Audio) Jake: I haven't been on a bike since I was a kid. -->

# --description--

In the Present Perfect Tense, to form a negative sentence, you insert `not` directly after `have` or `has`. This construction allows you to express actions and events that have not taken place recently. 

For example, if Jake wishes to express that a significant amount of time has passed since his last bicycle ride, he could say, `I have not been on a bike since I was a child.`.

In this sentence, the combination of the verb `have` and `not` can also be abbreviated to `haven't`: `I haven't been on a bike since I was a child.`
