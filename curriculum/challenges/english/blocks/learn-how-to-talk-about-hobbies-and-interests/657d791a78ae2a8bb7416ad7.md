<!-- (Audio) Bob: For nearly a decade now. It started as a hobby, but it's become a significant part of my life. -->

# --description--

To `become` is normally associated with transforming into something that was not the same way originally.

When you say `I became addicted to coffee when I started working at the company` (`became` is the past form of `become`), you imply that you weren't addicted to coffee before joining the company, but now you are.

With the `Present Perfect` tense, you use the form `become` after `have` or `has`, meaning it is a change that still influences you. For example, `I've become interested in video games at age 20`.
