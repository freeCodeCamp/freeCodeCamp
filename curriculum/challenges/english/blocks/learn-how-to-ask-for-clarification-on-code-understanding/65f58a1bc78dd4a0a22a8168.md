<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Brian, I've encountered an issue in the code, and I can't quite pinpoint what's causing it. -->

# --description--

`Encounter`, especially in its past form `encountered`, means to come across something, usually unexpectedly. For example, `I encountered an error while testing the software.` It implies finding something without looking for it.

`Pinpoint` means to identify something very precisely. For instance, `After reviewing the code, I was able to pinpoint the error.` This means finding exactly where and what the problem is.

In coding, finding issues can often be about `encountering` unexpected problems and trying to `pinpoint` their causes.
