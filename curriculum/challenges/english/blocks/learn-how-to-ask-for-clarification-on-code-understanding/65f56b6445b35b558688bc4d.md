<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I see. I should probably debug it step by step. With your input, we can work together to solve this problem. -->

# --description--

`Step by step` means doing something one stage at a time. For example, `debugging step by step` means solving a problem in small, manageable parts. 

`Input` in coding often means information or advice given for a project.

`Work together` means to collaborate, and `pair up` is similar, meaning two people working closely together.

Finally, `to solve a problem` is to try to find a solution for it. In this case, Tom and Sarah are trying to find a solution for a possible bug in the code.
