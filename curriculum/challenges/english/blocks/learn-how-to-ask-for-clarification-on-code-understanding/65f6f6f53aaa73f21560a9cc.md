# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What do Sophie's uses of `could` and `should` indicate?

## --answers--

She is confident that the issue is a performance bottleneck.

### --feedback--

`Could` suggests a possibility, not certainty. `Should` indicates an action she plans to take, not a conclusion.

---

She needs to confirm if the issue is a performance bottleneck.

---

She has already resolved the performance bottleneck.

### --feedback--

`Should` indicates a future action to confirm, not that the issue has already been resolved.

---

She dismisses the possibility of a performance bottleneck.

### --feedback--
