<!-- (Audio) Brian: In the function you added, it could be that I'm missing something, but it may not be working as expected. -->

# --description--

A `function` in coding is a set of instructions within a program. It's designed to perform a particular task. You define a `function` once, specifying what it should do, and then you can use it as many times as you need by calling its name.

If something is `missing` in code, it means a necessary part is not present or overlooked.

When code is `working as expected`, it performs exactly how it's supposed to, without errors or issues.
