<!-- (Audio) Brian: Understood. We can investigate this together, and by the end of it, we should have a clearer picture of what's happening. -->

# --description--

`By the end of it` means when something is over or is about to finish. 

`A clearer picture` metaphorically means a better or more complete understanding. It's like when you clean your glasses and suddenly see things more clearly.

An example of `a clearer picture`: `After studying, I have a clearer picture of the math problem.`
