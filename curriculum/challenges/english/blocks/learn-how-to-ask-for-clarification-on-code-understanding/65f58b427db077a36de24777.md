<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Brian, I've encountered an issue in the code, and I can't quite pinpoint what's causing it. -->

# --description--

`Quite` is used to add emphasis and can mean very or a lot. For example, if you say `I'm quite tired`, it means you are very tired.

In the dialogue, Sophie says, `I can't quite pinpoint...` which means she is having a lot of trouble finding the exact problem.
