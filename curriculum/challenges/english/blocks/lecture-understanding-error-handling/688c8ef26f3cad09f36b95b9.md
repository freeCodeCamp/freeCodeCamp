# --description--

Debugging is an essential skill for any Python developer. Understanding foundational techniques can help you identify and fix issues efficiently.

Debugging is the process of identifying and resolving errors or bugs in your code. It involves examining the code, understanding the flow, and using tools to pinpoint the source of problems.

In this lecture, we'll go over common debugging techniques you can use in your next Python project.

## Using the print function and f-strings

First, using the `print()` function and f-strings at various points in your code can help you understand the flow and state of variables. For example:

```py
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    print(f'Adding {a} and {b} gives {result}')
    return result
```

By printing the values of `a`, `b`, and `result`, you can verify that the function behaves as expected.

## Interactive Debugging with the `pdb` Module

Next, you can utilize Python's built-in `pdb` module for interactive debugging:

```py
import pdb

def divide(a, b):
    pdb.set_trace()
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 2))
```

By setting a trace with the `.set_trace()` method, you can step through the code, inspect variables, and understand the program's behavior.

If you run the code above, you'll see some output showing the location of the file you're running, the line where you called the `.set_trace()` method and the code immediately after it, and an interactive `pdb` prompt:

```py
> /Users/fcc/Desktop/lecture.py(5)divide()
-> return a / b
(Pdb)
```

If you enter help into the prompt, you'll see a list of commands you can use:

```py
(Pdb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF    c          d        h         list      q        rv       undisplay
a      cl         debug    help      ll        quit     s        unt      
alias  clear      disable  ignore    longlist  r        source   until    
args   commands   display  interact  n         restart  step     up       
b      condition  down     j         next      return   tbreak   w        
break  cont       enable   jump      p         retval   u        whatis   
bt     continue   exit     l         pp        run      unalias  where    

Miscellaneous help topics:
==========================
exec  pdb
```

Then you can use the commands to debug your code.

For example, if you want to look at the type of elements throughout your code at that moment, you can use the `whatis` command:

```py
(Pdb) whatis a
<class 'int'>
(Pdb) whatis divide
Function divide
```

As you can see, by the time you run `.set_trace()`, the type of the parameter a is an integer, and divide is a function.

Then to continue execution of your code, you can use the `continue` command, or one of its aliases, `cont` or `c`:

```py
(Pdb) continue
5.0
```

## IDE Debugging Tools

Many Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) offer advanced debugging tools, such as breakpoints, step execution, and variable inspection.

## Using VS Code Debugger

If you use VS Code, you can set breakpoints in your code and run the debugger to pause execution at those points. Here's how to debug the same `divide` function:

**Step 1: Set up your code** Create a file called `main.py` with the following content:

```py
def divide(a, b):
    result = a / b
    return result

print(divide(10, 2))
print(divide(15, 3))
```

**Step 2: Set a breakpoint**

1. Click in the gutter (left margin) next to line 2 (`result = a / b`) to set a breakpoint

2. A red dot will appear, indicating the breakpoint is set

**Step 3: Start debugging**

1. Press `F5` or go to Run > Start Debugging

2. Select "Python File" when prompted

3. The debugger will pause execution at your breakpoint

**Step 4: Inspect variables**

- Hover over variables to see their current values

- Use the Variables panel on the left to see all local variables

- Use the Debug Console at the bottom to evaluate expressions

**Step 5: Step through code**

Use the debug toolbar to:

- **Continue (F5)**: Resume execution until the next breakpoint

- **Step Over (F10)**: Execute the current line and move to the next

- **Step Into (F11)**: Enter into function calls

- **Step Out (Shift+F11)**: Exit the current function

IDE debugging tools provide a visual interface to examine the state of your program, making it easier to identify and fix issues compared to using print statements alone.

By mastering these foundational debugging techniques - using `print()` statements, the pdb module, and IDE tools - you can effectively identify and resolve issues in your Python code. Each technique has its place: `print()` statements for quick checks, pdb for interactive exploration, and IDE debuggers for visual inspection.
