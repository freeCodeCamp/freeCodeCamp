# --description--

The Redux store object provides several methods that allow you to interact with it. For example, you can retrieve the current `state` held in the Redux store object with the `getState()` method.

# --instructions--

The code from the previous challenge is re-written more concisely in the code editor. Use `store.getState()` to retrieve the `state` from the `store`, and assign this to a new variable `currentState`.

# --hints--

The Redux store should have a value of 5 for the initial state.

```js
assert(store.getState() === 5);
```

A variable `currentState` should exist and should be assigned the current state of the Redux store.

```js
assert(currentState === 5 && code.includes('store.getState()'));
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

// Change code below this line
```

# --solutions--

```js
const store = Redux.createStore(
  (state = 5) => state
);

// Change code below this line
const currentState = store.getState();
```
