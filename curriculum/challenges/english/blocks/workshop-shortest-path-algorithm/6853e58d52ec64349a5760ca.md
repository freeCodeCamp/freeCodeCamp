# --description--

In this workshop, you will implement the shortest path algorithm. You will write a Python function that computes the shortest path between the nodes in a graph, and also returns the path taken.

For example, given a graph where cities are connected by roads with different distances, the algorithm will find the shortest route from one city to another. If you want to travel from City A to City D, the algorithm might find that going A → B → C → D (total: 15km) is shorter than going directly A → D (20km).

To get started, define a variable named `INF` and assign it the value `float("inf")`, which represents positive infinity. Later, you'll use it to indicate an infinite distance between two nodes.

# --hints--

You should define the variable `INF` at the top of your file.

```js
({
  test: () => {
    assert(runPython(`_Node(_code).has_variable("INF")`))
  }
})
```

You should assign `float("inf")` to the variable `INF`.

```js
({
  test: () => {
    assert(runPython(`_Node(_code).find_variable("INF").is_equivalent("INF = float('inf')")`))
  }
})
```
