# --description--

You need to decide whether the current node is a better choice than the one you've already found (if any). To do this, youâ€™ll add a conditional statement inside the loop.

The condition should do two things:

- Check if the node has not been visited yet.
- Compare the known distance to the current `min_distance`.

Inside the `for node_no in range(n):` loop, add an `if` statement that checks whether `node_no` has not been visited **and** whether `distances[node_no]` is less than `min_distance`. 

Add `pass` as a placeholder inside the conditional block.

# --hints--

You should add an `if` statement that checks if the node is unvisited and has a shorter distance.

```js
({
  test: () => {
    const code = runPython(`_code`);
    assert(code.includes("if not visited[node_no] and distances[node_no] < min_distance:"));
  }
})
```

INF = float("inf")

  [0, 5, 3, INF, 11, INF],
  [5, 0, 1, INF, INF, 2],

  [INF, INF, 1, 0, 9, 3],
  [11, INF, 5, 9, 0, INF],
  [INF, 2, INF, 3, INF, 0],
]

def shortest_path(matrix, start_node, target_node=None):
  n = len(matrix)
  distances = [INF] * n
  distances[start_node] = 0
  paths = [[node_no] for node_no in range(n)]
  visited = [False] * n
