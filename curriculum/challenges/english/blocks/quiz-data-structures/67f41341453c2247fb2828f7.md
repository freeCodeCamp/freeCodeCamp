## --quiz--

### --question--

#### --text--

What does Big O notation describe in algorithm analysis?

#### --distractors--

The exact runtime in seconds for a specific computer

---

The percentage of code lines executed during a run

---

How readable the code is to other developers

#### --answer--

How the time or space grows relative to input size (an upper bound)

### --question--

#### --text--

When starting an algorithmic challenge, what is the best first step?

#### --distractors--

Begin coding immediately to gain momentum

---

Optimize for performance before you understand the problem

---

Write unit tests only after finishing the solution

#### --answer--

Clarify the problem and constraints with examples and edge cases

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the key difference between dynamic arrays and static arrays?

#### --distractors--

Dynamic arrays store values of different types; static arrays cannot

---

Static arrays allow duplicate values; dynamic arrays do not

---

Dynamic arrays are faster than static arrays for every operation

#### --answer--

Dynamic arrays can grow or shrink by resizing; static arrays have a fixed size

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the amortized time complexity of appending an element to the end of a dynamic array?

#### --distractors--

O(n)

---

O(log n)

---

O(n log n)

#### --answer--

O(1) amortized

### --question--

#### --text--

Why does accessing the k-th element by index in a singly linked list take O(n) time?

#### --distractors--

The list must be resized before any access

---

The index is hashed and looked up in a table

---

Nodes are stored contiguously, so shifting is required

#### --answer--

You must traverse from the head node to the k-th node one by one

### --question--

#### --text--

Which feature does a doubly linked list have that a singly linked list does not?

#### --distractors--

Random access to any index in O(1) time

---

A built-in array buffer for faster iteration

---

Automatic maintenance of the list length as a constant

#### --answer--

Pointers to both next and previous nodes enabling backward traversal

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following best describes a stack?

#### --distractors--

First In, First Out (FIFO) with removals at the front

---

A structure where any element can be removed in O(1) time

---

A circular buffer with constant-time random access

#### --answer--

Last In, First Out (LIFO) with push and pop at the top

### --question--

#### --text--

Which operation removes the element at the front of a queue?

#### --distractors--

push

---

pop

---

peek

#### --answer--

dequeue

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the typical average-case time complexity to look up a value by key in a hash map?

#### --distractors--

O(n)

---

O(log n)

---

O(n log n)

#### --answer--

O(1) on average with a good hash function and low load factor

### --question--

#### --text--

Which guarantee is provided by a set data structure?

#### --distractors--

Elements are stored in sorted order by default

---

Duplicate values are allowed and kept together

---

Elements are indexed by their insertion position

#### --answer--

It stores only unique elements (no duplicates)
