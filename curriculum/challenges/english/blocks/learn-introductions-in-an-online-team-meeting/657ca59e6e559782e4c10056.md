# --description--

In companies, job titles often include words that indicate the level of seniority. `Senior` means having a higher level or more experience in a role. For instance, a `senior software developer` usually has more experience than a `software developer`. 

Other common terms include `junior`, for less experienced roles, and `lead` or `head`, for top-level positions. Here are some examples:

`Junior Accountant`: An entry-level position in accounting.

`Lead Engineer`: A top-level engineering role with leadership responsibilities.
