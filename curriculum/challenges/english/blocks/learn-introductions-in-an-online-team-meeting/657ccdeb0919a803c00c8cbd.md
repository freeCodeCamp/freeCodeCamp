# --description--

`Last year` refers to the year before the current one. For example, if it is 2043 now, last year was 2042. `This year` refers to the current year, 2043 in this example. 

`Next year` will be the year after the current one, which would be 2044 in this case. Understanding these expressions helps in placing events correctly in time.
