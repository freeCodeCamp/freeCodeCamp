# --description--

To `collaborate` means to work together with others to achieve a common goal, often involving shared responsibilities and teamwork. For example:

- `We collaborate on the same app.` - The team works together on the app.

- `Developers and designers collaborate to build the website.` - They work together to create the site.

While `contributing` involves adding something to a project, `collaborating` emphasizes working together as a team.
