There are many ways to represent data in a visual format. In this lesson, you will learn about a few commonly used types of data visualizations.

The first type you will learn about is charts that represent change over time, like stock price performance or health statistics.

Another common type of visual would be a category comparison chart. This type of visual shows comparisons between different categories, such as ad performance across marketing channels, or sales by product category for online stores.

If you needed to represent an item's position in an ordered list, you could use a ranking chart. Examples of this type of visual would include performance statistics or election results.

Another commonly used type of data visualization would be a part of the whole visual. This would include pie charts or treemaps that could be used to represent budgets or product categories.

If you are working with data that shows a correlation between two or more variables, you can use a correlation chart. These types of charts would include heat maps or scatterplots that could represent data such as income vs. education level, advertising spend vs. sales, or temperature vs. energy consumption.
