# --description--

In the prior lessons, you were introduced to data visualization which is the process of creating clear, visual formats to represent complex data. In this lesson, you will learn about the D3 library.

The D3 library is a free and open source library you can use to create compelling and effective data visualizations in JavaScript.

The name D3 is short for data-driven documents, referring to how it dynamically binds data to elements in the Document Object Model (DOM). This library is flexible and works naturally with the web. Instead of having to learn a whole new graphical representation, you can build data visualizations with `svg` and `canvas` elements.

For example, if you want to create a bar chart using D3, you can do the following all in one JS file:

* Declare variables representing the chart dimensions and margins
    
* Declare the horizontal position scale
    
* Declare the vertical position scale
    
* Create the SVG container with the bars and labels

So what are some other reasons to learn D3 over other visualization tools like Chart.js, Plotly, or Tableau?

Unlike other tools, D3 provides you with a lot of low level control where you can build customizable and interactive visualizations with just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Plus, the library is in JavaScript, so you don't need to worry about learning a whole new language.

In upcoming workshops and labs, you will learn the fundamentals of the D3 library like selections, shapes, and scales. You will learn these key concepts by building scatterplot graphs, bar charts, dashboard apps, and more.
