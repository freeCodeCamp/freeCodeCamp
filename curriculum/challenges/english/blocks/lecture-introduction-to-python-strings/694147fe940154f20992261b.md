# --description--

In a previous lesson, you learned how each character in a string can be indentified by its index (starting from zero), and accessed using the bracket notation:

```python
my_str = "Hello world"

print(my_str[0])  # H
print(my_str[6])  # w
print(my_str[-1]) # d
```

**String slicing** lets you extract a portion of a string or work with only a specific part of it. Here's the basic syntax:

```python
string[start:stop]
```

If you want to extract characters from a certain index to another, you just separate the `start` and `stop` indices with a colon:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[1:4]) # ell
```

Note that the `stop` index is non-inclusive, so `[1:4]` just extracted the characters from index `1`, and up to, but not including, the character at index `4`.

You can also omit the `start` and `stop` indices, and Python will default to `0` or the end of the string, respectively. For example, here's what happens if you omit the `start` index:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[:7])  # Hello w
```

This extracts everything from index `0` up to (but not including), the character at index `7`. And here's what happens if you omit the `stop` index:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[8:])  # rld
```

This extracts everything from the character at index `8` until the end of the string.

You can also omit both the `start` and `stop` indices, which will extract the whole string:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[:])  # Hello world
```

Apart from the `start` and `stop` indices, there's also an optional step parameter, which is used to specify the increment between each index in the slice.

Here's the syntax for that:

```python
string[start:stop:step]
```

In the example below, the slicing starts at index `0`, stops before `11`, and extracts every second character:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[0:11:2])  # Hlowrd
```

A helpful trick you can do with the `step` parameter is to reverse a string by setting step to `-1`, and leaving `start` and `stop` blank:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'
print(my_str[::-1]) # dlrow olleH
```

It can also be helpful to check if a character or set of characters exist in a string before slicing it. To do that, Python provides the `in` operator, which returns a boolean that specifies whether the character or characters exist in the string or not.

Here are some examples:

```python
my_str = 'Hello world'

print('Hello' in my_str)  # True
print('hey' in my_str)    # False
print('hi' in my_str)    # False
print('e' in my_str)  # True
print('f' in my_str)  # False
```
