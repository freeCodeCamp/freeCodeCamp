In a prior lesson, you were first introduced to the `iframe` element. In this lesson, you will learn more about how to work with the `iframe` element. This element stands for inline frame. It's an inline element used to embed other HTML content directly within the HTML page. That HTML content could be a video, map, another HTML element, or even other web pages.

Here's an example of embedding a popular freeCodeCamp course from YouTube. To see a different video, change the `src` value to a video of your choosing.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<iframe
  width="400"
  height="400"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkZNo7MFNFg?si=-UBVIUNM3csdeiWF"
  title="Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners (YouTube video)"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

:::

The `src` attribute specifies the URL of the page you want to embed. The `width` attribute specifies the width of the `iframe`. The `height` attribute specifies the height of the `iframe`. The `allowfullscreen` attribute allows the user to display the `iframe` in full screen mode. It's also a good practice to specify a `title` attribute for the `iframe`, as it's important for accessibility.

Note that the video can come from anywhere. It doesn't have to come from video services like YouTube and Vimeo.

Don't forget you can also embed a map, another web page, or direct HTML within the `iframe` element. Here is an example of an embedded map.

Try interacting with the map by zooming in and out.

```html
<h1>A Map from Openstreetmap.org Embedded with the iframe Element</h1>

<iframe
  width="425"
  height="350"
  src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=3.006134033203125%2C6.150112578753815%2C3.6357879638671875%2C6.749850810550778&amp;layer=mapnik"
  title="Map of Lagos area, Nigeria"

  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/6.4501/3.3210">

  </a>

```

If you want to embed direct HTML within the `iframe` element you have to use the `srcdoc` attribute instead of `src`.
