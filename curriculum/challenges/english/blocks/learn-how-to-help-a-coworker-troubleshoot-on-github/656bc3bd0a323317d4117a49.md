# --description--

The past continuous tense is used to talk about actions that were ongoing in the past. 

It is formed using `was`  for the pronouns `I`, `he`, `she`, `it`, or `were` for the pronouns `you`, `we`, `they` followed by a verb ending in `-ing`. For example:

`I was reading` means the work was happening over a period of time in the past. 

Past continuous is often used when an action is interrupted by another, as in `I was reading when the phone rang.` The reading was interrupted by the phone ringing.
