# --description--

You can think of variables as "storage containers" for data in your code.

A variable is a "named storage" for data. You can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

To create a variable in JavaScript, use the `let` keyword.

The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name "message":

```js
let message;
```

Now, you can put some data into it by using the assignment operator `=`:

```js
let message;

// store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
message = 'Hello'; 
```

To be concise, you can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:

```js
let message = 'Hello';
```
