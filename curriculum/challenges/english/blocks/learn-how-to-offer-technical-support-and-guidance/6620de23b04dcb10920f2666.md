<!-- (Audio) Sarah: To finish, let's consider the comments. If you include comments when they're necessary, it helps future developers  understand the logic. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Sarah emphasize the inclusion of comments in code?

## --answers--

Because it makes the code run faster

### --feedback--

Comments in the code do not affect the speed at which the code runs. They are for human understanding.

---

To help future developers understand the logic of the code

---

Because comments are required in all programming languages

### --feedback--

While comments are helpful, they are not a strict requirement in all programming languages.

---

To prevent the code from having errors

### --feedback--

Comments help in understanding the code but do not directly prevent errors in the code.
