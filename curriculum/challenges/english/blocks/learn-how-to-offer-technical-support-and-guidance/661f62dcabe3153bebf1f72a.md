<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Hi, Tom! Thanks for submitting your code for review. Let's take a look together. -->

# --description--

In this task, you'll learn about `submitting` code for review and the phrase `take a look together`.

`Submitting` means sending or presenting something for consideration or judgment. In a programming context, `submitting code` means sending your code to someone else, like a team member or a supervisor, for them to review it.

`Take a look together` means to examine or review something as a group or with someone else. For example, in a work setting, saying, `Let's take a look at the report together` suggests reviewing the report as a team.
