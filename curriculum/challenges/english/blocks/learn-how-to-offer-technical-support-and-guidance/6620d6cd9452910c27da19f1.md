<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Now, let's talk about error handling. If you encounter potential issues, it's a good idea to use conditional statements to handle them gracefully. -->

# --description--

In this conversation, Sarah is explaining important concepts in programming. `Encounter` means to come across something, `potential issues` are problems that might happen, `conditional statements` are codes that run only if certain conditions are met, and `gracefully` refers to managing problems smoothly.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is Sarah suggesting to Tom about handling errors in programming?

## --answers--

To use conditional statements to manage potential issues smoothly

---

To ignore any potential issues that are encountered

### --feedback--

Ignoring potential issues is not a good practice. Sarah suggests managing them smoothly.

---

To stop the program whenever an error is encountered

### --feedback--

Stopping the program is not handling errors gracefully. Sarah talks about managing them smoothly.

---

To only focus on errors that happen frequently

### --feedback--

Focusing only on frequent errors doesn't cover all potential issues. Sarah is talking about handling any potential issues gracefully.
