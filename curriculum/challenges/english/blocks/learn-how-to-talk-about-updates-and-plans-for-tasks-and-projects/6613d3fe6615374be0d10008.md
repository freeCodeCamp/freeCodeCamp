<!-- (Audio) Brian: Well, we're going to use a framework for the front-end, probably React. It's the technology we're most comfortable with, and it will make development faster. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Brian say about the front-end development of the project?

## --answers--

`We will use React because we're planning to make development faster.`

### --feedback--

This sentence incorrectly uses `will` where `going to` would be more appropriate, as it's a planned decision, not a spontaneous one.

---

`We are going to use a different technology since React is too complex for us.`

### --feedback--

This option inaccurately represents Brian's statement. He mentions React as the chosen technology due to their comfort with it, not its complexity.

---

`We're unsure about using React, but we will decide soon.`

### --feedback--

This sentence does not correctly reflect Brian's statement. He clearly indicates a plan to use React, showing no uncertainty.

---

`We are going to use React for the front-end, and it will speed up development.`
