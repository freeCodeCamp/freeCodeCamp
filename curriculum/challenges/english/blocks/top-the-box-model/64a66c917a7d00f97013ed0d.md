# --description--

The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful in CSS is the box model. It isnâ€™t complicated, but skipping over it now will cause you much frustration down the line.

Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another. You can get a rough idea of how this works by sticking a border on every item on the page like this:

```css
* {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

# --assignment--

Add a border to every element on the page and see how the boxes are laid out.
