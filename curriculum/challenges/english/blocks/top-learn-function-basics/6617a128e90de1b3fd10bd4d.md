# --description--

Letâ€™s discuss parameters and arguments in the context of the following example function:

```js
function favoriteAnimal(animal) {
  return animal + " is my favorite animal!"
}

console.log(favoriteAnimal('Goat'));
```

In JavaScript, parameters are the items listed between the parentheses `()` in the function declaration. Function arguments are the actual values you decide to pass to the function.

In the example above, the function definition is written on the first line: `function favoriteAnimal(animal)`. The parameter, `animal`, is found inside the parentheses. You could just as easily replace `animal` with `pet`, `x`, or `blah`. But in this case, naming the parameter `animal` gives someone reading your code a bit of context so that they don't have to guess what `animal` may eventually contain.
