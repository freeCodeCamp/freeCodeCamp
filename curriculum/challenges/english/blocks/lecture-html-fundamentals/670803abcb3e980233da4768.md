# --interactive--

The `div` element is used as a container to group other elements. 

Here is an example of a `div` element. Add another paragraph element inside of the `div` element and see the changes in the preview window.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<div>
  <p>Example paragraph element.</p>

</div>
```

:::

You will mainly use the `div` element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles. You will learn more about CSS in future lessons and workshops. 

Even though the `div` element is commonly used in real world codebases, you should be careful not to overuse it. There are times when another element would be more appropriate. 

For example, if you wanted divide up your content into sections, then the `section` element would be more appropriate than a `div` element. 

Add another `section` element below the first one. Then inside of the `section` element, a `h2` and `p` elements. You can use whatever text you like and you will see the changes in the preview window.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<section>
  <h2>Mammals</h2>
  <p>Mammals are warm-blooded animals with fur or hair. Most give birth to live young.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lion</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Dolphin</li>
  </ul>
</section>
```

The `section` element has semantic meaning over the `div` element which is not semantic. Semantics are the meaning of words or phrases in a language. In HTML, which is a language, elements have their own semantic meaning too. So, this means if you use a `section` element, the browser will pick up its semantic meaning and understand to treat this as a section - on desktops, mobiles, you name it.Â
