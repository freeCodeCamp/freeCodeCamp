<!-- (Audio) Bob: Hey, have you met Anna yet? -->

# --description--

The word `yet` is often used in questions and negative statements in the *Present Perfect* tense to talk about something that hasn't happened up to the present moment but is expected to happen. It's a way to ask or say if something has occurred or not until now.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does Bob want to know by using `yet` in his question?

## --answers--

If Anna is planning to meet Sophie later

### --feedback--

The use of `yet` asks about something that might have already happened, not about future plans.

---

If Sophie has never heard of Anna

### --feedback--

Bob's use of `yet` implies he's asking about meeting Anna, not about hearing of her.

---

If Sophie has met Anna at any time up until now

---

If meeting Anna is not possible

### --feedback--

`Yet` suggests the action could still happen, not that it's impossible.
