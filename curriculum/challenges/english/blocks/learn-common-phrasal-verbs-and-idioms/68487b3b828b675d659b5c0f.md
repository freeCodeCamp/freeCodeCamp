`in-office`

This describes the days when employees must be physically present at work. This is a compound word, remember to use `-`.

# --explanation--

A `clause` is a section or part of a legal or formal document, like a policy or contract. For example:

`The new agreement includes a clause about remote work options.` – This means there's a specific rule or condition in the agreement about working remotely.

`In-office days` refers to the days employees are required to be physically present at their workplace. For example:

`Our team has two in-office days each week: Monday and Wednesday.` – This means employees must come to the office on those two days.
