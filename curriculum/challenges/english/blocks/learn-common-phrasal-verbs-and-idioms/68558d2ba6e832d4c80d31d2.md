<!-- (Audio) Linda: First off, the password creation screen. We need to make the instructions clearer and more prominent. Users often overlook them. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could Jake tell Linda he thinks her idea is a good one?

## --answers--

`I like that.`

---

`Are you sure?`

### --feedback--

This sounds doubtful, not supportive.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`I like that.` is a casual and friendly way to show agreement or approval of someone's idea. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's move the meeting to 10 a.m.` – This person is suggesting a change of schedule.

- Person 2: `I like that.` – This means the speaker supports or agrees with the suggestion.
