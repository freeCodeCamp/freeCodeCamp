A `kink` is a small issue, flaw, or difficulty in a system or process. For example:

`We need to fix a few kinks in the app before we launch.` – This means there are minor problems that need to be resolved.

`Buy-in` is an agreement or support for an idea or plan, especially from a group or team. For example:

`The project won't move forward without full team buy-in.` – This means the team must agree with and support the project before it continues.
