After talking to Jake, Linda drafts up a list of his suggestions and implementation ideas.

`1. Tooltips and Visual Indicators for Password Strength`

`Use tooltips or visual elements to show users how strong their password is. We should add a real-time strength meter below the password input, with color coding from red to green and labels like Weak, Moderate, and Strong. Hoverable tooltips or info icons could explain what makes a password stronger â€” like including numbers, symbols, and both uppercase and lowercase letters.`

`2. Custom Security Questions for Password Recovery`

`Allow users to create their own security questions instead of choosing from a preset list. We could add a "Create your own question" option and guide users with examples or prompts to help them come up with something both secure and memorable. We'll also need to build in some basic checks to avoid overly simple or generic questions.`

`3. Real-Time Alerts for Suspicious Activity`

`Use urgent, interactive pop-ups with intuitive graphics to alert users. We can design a system where a warning pops up in real time if something unusual happens, like a login from a new device. These alerts should block further action until the user responds, and include strong visuals like warning icons and concise, clear messaging.`

`4. Interactive Quiz for Phishing Awareness`

`Integrate a short quiz into the onboarding process to teach users how to recognize phishing attempts. This could be a fun, interactive module with real-world scenarios, such as identifying suspicious links in emails. We can add instant feedback for each question and maybe even small rewards or progress tracking to make it engaging.`

What does Jake suggest to help users understand password strength?

When reviewing Linda's list, you'll see that each item is based on a specific area she thinks can be improved. At the start of each paragraph, she refers to Jake's suggestion, and then she shares her thoughts on how to implement it.

To find the correct answer, look at item `1. Tooltips and Visual Indicators for Password Strength` and read the first sentence of that paragraph to be able to correctly answer this question.
