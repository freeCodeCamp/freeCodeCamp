# --explanation--

A `phishing attempt` is when someone tries to trick a user into giving personal or sensitive information, usually by pretending to be a trusted source. For example:

`The email looked real, but it was actually a phishing attempt to get my login details.` â€“ This means the message was fake and meant to steal personal information.
