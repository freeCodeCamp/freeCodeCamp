# --explanation--

`To improve` means to make something better. For example:

`We improved the loading time of the app by optimizing the images.` – This means they made the app faster.

`To guide` means to lead or show someone how to do something. For example:

`The tutorial will guide new users through the setup process.` – This means the tutorial helps users understand how to start using the app.
