`To require` means to need something or demand that someone do something. For example:

`The form requires your signature before submission.` – This means you must sign the form to complete it.

`To proceed` means to continue or move forward with something. For example:

`Click "Next" to proceed with the installation.` – This means continue to the next step of the process.
