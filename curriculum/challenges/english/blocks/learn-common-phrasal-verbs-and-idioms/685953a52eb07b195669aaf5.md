# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I'd suggest late afternoon, maybe around 4 p.m. so it doesn't BLANK with other meetings.`

## --blanks--

`clash`

### --feedback--

This means to happen at the same time as something else in a way that causes a conflict.

# --explanation--

`To clash` means to happen at the same time as something else, making it difficult to do both. For example:

`My dentist appointment clashed with our team meeting.` â€“ This means the person had two events at the same time and couldn't attend both.
