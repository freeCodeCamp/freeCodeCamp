# --explanation--

**Idiomatic expressions** are phrases whose meanings are different from the literal meanings of the words. They represent common ways of speaking that often cannot be understood just by looking at each word.  

`Back and forth` is an **idiomatic expression** meaning a repeated movement or exchange between two points or ideas. In the dialogue, it means ongoing discussion with different opinions or ideas shared repeatedly. Another example:

`There was a lot of back and forth between the team members before deciding on the design.` â€“ This means the team members discussed many times before reaching a decision.
