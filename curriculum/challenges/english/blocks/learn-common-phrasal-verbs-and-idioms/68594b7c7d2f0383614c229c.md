# --explanation--

`That should work.` is a common, casual way to say that a date or time is acceptable. It shows agreement, though not with total certainty. For example:

- Person 1: `We can meet at 2 p.m. tomorrow.` – The first person suggests a date and time for a meeting.

- Person 2: `That should work.` – This means the speaker agrees with the time and thinks it will be okay.
