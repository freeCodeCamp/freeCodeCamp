`Security questions` are questions used to verify a user's identity, usually when logging in or recovering an account. For example:

`One of the security questions asked for my mother's maiden name.` – This means that the user is asked their mother's name before she got married as a form of verifying the user's identity.

`Password recovery` is the process of regaining access to an account when the password is forgotten or lost. For example:

`The app sent me a reset link for password recovery.` – This means the user got help to reset their forgotten password.
