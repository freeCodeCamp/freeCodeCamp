# --explanation--

`Do we want to...` is just a polite and collaborative way to ask about making a decision or plan. You're not asking others if you want something to happen. For example:

`Do we want to invite the entire department to the meeting?` –  This means the speaker is asking for input on whether it's a good idea.

`To open something up` means to allow access or participation, especially to a larger group. For example:

`We decided to open up the training to all departments.` – This means more people from different departments can now join.
