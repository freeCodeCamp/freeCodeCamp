# --explanation--

The `Present Continuous` tense (`to be`+ verb in the `-ing` form) is often used to talk about scheduled future events, especially when arrangements have been made. For example:

`We are meeting with the design team on Thursday.` â€“ This means the meeting is already planned and will happen in the future.
