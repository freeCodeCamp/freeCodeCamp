Paired with `work`, this describes working from a place outside the office.

# --explanation--

A `guideline` is a rule or piece of advice that tells people how to act in certain situations. For example:

`The company shared new safety guidelines for using office equipment.` – This means the company gave clear instructions to help employees stay safe.

`Remote work` is working from a place other than the usual office, often from home. For example:

`Many employees prefer remote work because it saves commuting time.` – This means working from home is popular because it is more convenient.
