# --explanation--

`Buenas noches` is a greeting used at night. It translates to "Good night".

You can use `Buenas noches` both when greeting someone in the evening **and** when greeting or saying goodbye to someone at night. For example, the sentence below works both to greet or say goodbye during the night:

`Buenas noches, señora López.` – Good night, Mrs. López.
