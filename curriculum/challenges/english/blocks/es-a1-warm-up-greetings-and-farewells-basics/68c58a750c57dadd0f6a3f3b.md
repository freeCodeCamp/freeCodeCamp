# --explanation--

`Chao` is an informal way to say goodbye in Spanish. It translates to "Bye". For example:  

`Chao, hasta mañana.` – Bye, see you tomorrow.

**Note**: There are two common spellings: `chao` and `chau`. Both are correct and used in different regions:

- `Chao` is more common in countries like Chile, Colombia, and Spain.

- `Chau` is more frequent in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.
