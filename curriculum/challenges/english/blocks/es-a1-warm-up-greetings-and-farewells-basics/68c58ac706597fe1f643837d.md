# --explanation--

`Hasta pronto` means "See you soon". It's used when you expect to see someone again in the near future.

It's similar to `Hasta luego` ("See you later"), but `hasta pronto` suggests a shorter wait, usually sooner rather than later. For example:

`Hasta pronto, Esteban.` – See you soon, Esteban.
