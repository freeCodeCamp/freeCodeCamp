# --interactive--

In programming, understanding how characters are represented as numbers is fundamental. This is where ASCII comes in. ASCII, short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard used in computers to represent text. It assigns a numeric value to each character, which is universally recognized by machines.

In this lesson, we will explore what ASCII is, how it works, and how JavaScript methods like `charCodeAt()` and `fromCharCode()` relate to character encoding. While JavaScript strings use Unicode (UTF-16) internally, ASCII values match the first 128 Unicode characters, which is why ASCII-based examples work in JavaScript.

ASCII is a system for encoding characters such as letters, digits, and symbols into numerical values. Each character is mapped to a specific number.

For example, the capital letter `A` is represented by the number `65` in ASCII, while the lowercase `a` is represented by `97`. This encoding allows computers to store and manipulate text.

The ASCII standard covers 128 characters including:

- Uppercase and lowercase English letters (A-Z, a-z).
- Numbers (0-9).  
- Common punctuation marks and symbols (!, @, #, and so on).
- Control characters (such as newline and tab).  

In JavaScript, you can access the numeric code of a character using the `charCodeAt()` method. This method returns the UTF-16 code unit of the character at a specified index. For the first 128 characters, this value matches the ASCII code.

Let’s take a look at an example:

:::interactive_editor

```js
let letter = "A";
console.log(letter.charCodeAt(0));  // 65
```

:::

In this example, `A` is the first character of the string, and calling `charCodeAt(0)` returns its numeric code (which matches its ASCII value for basic Latin characters), `65`.

You can also use this method with other characters to find their numeric code values:

:::interactive_editor

```js
let symbol = "!";
console.log(symbol.charCodeAt(0));  // 33
```

:::

Here, the numeric code for the exclamation mark `!` is returned as `33` (which matches its ASCII value).

While `charCodeAt()` helps you retrieve the numeric code of a character, the `fromCharCode()` method allows you to do the opposite: convert a UTF-16 code unit (which matches ASCII for basic characters) into its corresponding character.

Let's see this in action:

:::interactive_editor

```js
let char = String.fromCharCode(65);
console.log(char);  //  A
```

:::

In this example, `fromCharCode(65)` converts the numeric code `65` (which matches the ASCII value for `A`) back to the character `A`.

Another example would be converting the number `97` to its corresponding lowercase letter:

:::interactive_editor

```js
let char = String.fromCharCode(97);
console.log(char);  // a
```

:::

These methods are particularly useful when you need to manipulate or compare characters based on their numeric code values.

For instance, you might use `charCodeAt()` to check if a character is uppercase, lowercase, or a digit by comparing its ASCII value.

On the other hand, `fromCharCode()` can be used to dynamically generate characters from their ASCII codes.
