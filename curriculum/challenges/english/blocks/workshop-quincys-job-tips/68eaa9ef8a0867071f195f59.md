# --description--

So far you have been using the `cite attribute to attribute the source of the quotation, but the attribute doesn't really show the source to the user. 

If you want to attribute the source visually, you can add a citation element, `cite`, outside the block quotation element. The citation element is an HTML element that you can use to mark up the title of a referenced creative work, like a book, article, song, film, website, or research paper. 

Here's an example:

```html
<div>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-college-worth-it/">
    The first thing you should consider about education is this is an economic decision.
  </blockquote>
  <p>—Quincy Larson, <cite>Is College Still Worth it? Tips from my 20 Years in Adult Education</cite></p>
</div>
```

Inside the `p` element below the block quotation element, wrap `How to Learn to Code and Get a Developer Job [Full Book]` in a `cite` element.
