# --description--

In the previous step you added a paragraph that contains a quote from Quincy. As you learned in the lesson on block and inline quotes, in HTML quoted elements are used to distinguish quoted text from the surrounding content.

The quote in this case is: `You can become a developer.`. It is part of the text of the larger paragraph. Thus, in order to distinguish the quote from the rest of the paragraph we need to use the inline quotation element `q`. Most modern browsers will add quotation marks around an inline quote automatically when you use this element.

This is an example: 

```html
<p>
  Quincy said, <q>Happy coding!</q>
</p>
```

Inside the paragraph wrap `You can become a developer.` in an inline quotation element, keeping the rest of the paragraph unchanged.
