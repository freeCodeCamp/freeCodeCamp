# --description--

As you recall from a prior lesson, the `q` element is used to distinguish quoted text from the surrounding content.

Here is an example: 

```html
<p>
  Quincy said, <q>Happy coding!</q>
</p>
```

Most modern browsers will add quotation marks around an inline quote automatically when you use the `q` element.

Inside the paragraph wrap `You can become a developer.` in an inline quotation element, keeping the rest of the paragraph unchanged.

# --hints--

You should have a `q` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('q'));
```

Your `q` element should be nested inside the paragraph, that is below the `h1` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('h1 + p > q'));
```

Your `q` element should have the text `You can become a developer.`.

```js
assert.equal(document.querySelector('h1 + p > q')?.textContent.trim(), 'You can become a developer.');
```

You should only add `q` tags around the appropriate part of the sentence without changing the original text. The `p` element should still read: `Learning to code is hard, but as Quincy Larson says, you can become a developer.`

```js
const pElCleanedText = document.querySelector('h1 + p')?.innerText.trim().replace(/ {2,}/g, ' ');
assert.equal(pElCleanedText, 'Learning to code is hard, but as Quincy Larson says, You can become a developer.');
```
