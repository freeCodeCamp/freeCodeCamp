You can write quoted text directly within the block quotation element, like you did in the `section` element above. Alternatively, you can wrap it within one or more paragraph elements. This is helpful when the text has multiple paragraphs, but you want to keep them within the same block quotation element. 

Here's an example with two paragraphs:

```html
<blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-college-worth-it/">
  <p>So many people ask me each week: is college still worth it? In this 1-hour video I answer this question and other commonly asked questions about university.</p>
  <p>I've been in adult education for two decades at this point, and even though I'm not a labor market economist, I do feel confident enough to answer these questions.</p>
</blockquote>
```

In the second section, inside the existing block quotation element, add four `p` elements with the following texts, in order: 

1. `So much of getting a job is who you know.` 
2. `It's OK to be an introvert, but you do need to push your boundaries.`
3. `Create GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Discord accounts.`
4. `Go to tech meetups and conferences. Travel if you have to.`
