# --description--

In the third and last `section` element, you are going to create the same HTML structure as you did in the preceding section.

First, inside the last section, add an `h2` element with the text `Importance of Building a Reputation`.

Then, below the `h2` element, add a block quotation element with a `cite` attribute set to `https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/`.

Lastly, nest three paragraph elements inside the block quotation element with the following texts, in order: 

1. `Share short video demos of your projects.`
2. `Keep applying to speak at bigger and bigger conferences.`
3. `Hang out at hackerspaces and help people who are even newer to coding than you.`

# --hints--

Your should have an `h2` element nested inside the thrid section.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > h2'));
```

Your `h2` element should have the text `Importance of Building a Reputation`.

```js
const h2El = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > h2');
assert.equal(h2El?.innerText.trim(), 'Importance of Building a Reputation');
```

You should have a `blockquote` element nested inside the third section.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote'));
```

Your `blockquote` element should be below your `h2` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > h2 + blockquote'));
```

Your `blockquote` element should have a `cite` attribute.

```js
const blockquoteEl = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote');
assert.exists(blockquoteEl?.getAttribute('cite'));
```

Your `cite` attribute of the `blockquote` element should have the value `https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/`.

```js
const blockquoteEl = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote');
assert.equal(blockquoteEl?.getAttribute('cite'), 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/');
```

You should have three `p` elements nested inside the `blockquote` element inside the third section.

```js
const thirdPEl = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote > p:nth-of-type(3)');
assert.exists(thirdPEl);
```

Your first `p` element should have the text `Share short video demos of your projects.`.

```js
const firstPEl = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote > p:nth-of-type(1)');
assert.equal(firstPEl?.innerText.trim(), 'Share short video demos of your projects.');
```

Your second `p` element should have the text `Keep applying to speak at bigger and bigger conferences.`.

```js
const secondPEl = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote > p:nth-of-type(2)');
assert.equal(secondPEl?.innerText.trim(), "Keep applying to speak at bigger and bigger conferences.");
```

Your third `p` element should have the text `Hang out at hackerspaces and help people who are even newer to coding than you.`.

```js
const thirdPEl = document.querySelector('main > section:nth-of-type(3) > blockquote > p:nth-of-type(3)');
assert.equal(thirdPEl?.innerText.trim(), 'Hang out at hackerspaces and help people who are even newer to coding than you.');
```
