# --description--

In the third and last `section` element, you are going to create the same HTML structure as you did in the preceding section.

First, inside the last section, add an `h2` element with the text `Importance of Building a Reputation`.

Then, below the `h2` element, add a block quotation element with a `cite` attribute set to `https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/`.

Lastly, nest three paragraph elements inside the block quotation element with the following texts, in order: 

1. `Share short video demos of your projects.`
2. `Keep applying to speak at bigger and bigger conferences.`
3. `Hang out at hackerspaces and help people who are even newer to coding than you.`
