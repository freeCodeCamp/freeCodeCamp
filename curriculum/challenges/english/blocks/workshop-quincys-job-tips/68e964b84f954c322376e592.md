If the source of a quote is a website, you can use cite it with the `cite` element. The value of this attribute should be a valid URL. While this attribute doesn't change the presentation of the block quote, it's very helpful for giving screen readers and search engines more information about the quote.

This is an example of a inline quotation element with an `cite` attribute:

```html
<p>
  Quincy said, 
  <q cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/quincys-5-worth-your-time-update/">
    Happy coding!
  </q>
</p>
```

Add the `cite` attribute to the inline quotation element with this URL: 

`https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/`
