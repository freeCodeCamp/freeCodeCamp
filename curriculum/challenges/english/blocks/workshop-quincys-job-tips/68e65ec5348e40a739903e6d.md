# --description--

Now, create a paragraph element below the `h1` element. Inside this paragraph add the text `Learning to code is hard, but as Quincy Larson says, You can become a developer.`

# --hints--

You should have a `p` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('p'));
```

Your paragraph should have the text `Learning to code is hard, but as Quincy Larson says, You can become a developer.` Double check your spelling.

```js
assert.equal(document.querySelector('p')?.textContent.trim(), "Learning to code is hard, but as Quincy Larson says, You can become a developer.");
```

Your paragraph should be below the `h1` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('h1 + p'));
```
