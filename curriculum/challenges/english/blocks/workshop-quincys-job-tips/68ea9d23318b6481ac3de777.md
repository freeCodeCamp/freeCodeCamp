# --description--

Exactly like the inline quotation element, you can also add a `cite` attribute to a block quotation element. 

This is an example of a block quotation element with a `cite` attribute:

```html
<blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/is-college-worth-it/">
  The first thing you should consider about education is this is an economic decision.
</blockquote>
```

Now, add a `cite` attribute to the block quotation element with the URL `https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/`.

# --hints--

Your `blockquote` element should have a `cite` attribute.

```js
const firstBlockquoteEl = document.querySelector('section:first-of-type > h2 + blockquote');
assert.exists(firstBlockquoteEl?.getAttribute('cite'));
```

The `cite` attribute should have the value `https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/`.

```js
const firstBlockquoteEl = document.querySelector('section:first-of-type > h2 + blockquote');
assert.equal(firstBlockquoteEl?.getAttribute('cite'), 'https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/');
```
