# --description--

Below the `h2` element, you will add another quote by Quincy. This time, the quote won't be part of a larger paragraph. Instead, the whole paragraph will be a quote. In order to distinguish quoted text like this, you should use the block quotation element: `blockquote`. In the browser, you'll see that the text is slightly indented.

This is an example of a block quotation element with quoted text:

```html
<blockquote>
  The first thing you should consider about education is this is an economic decision.
</blockquote>
```

Now, inside the first section, add a block quotation element below the `h2` element with the text `Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?`.

# --hints--

Inside the first section, you should have a `blockquote` element below the `h2` element.

```js
assert.exists(document.querySelector('section:first-of-type > h2 + blockquote'));
```

Your blockquote should have the text `Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?`.

```js
const firstBlockquoteEl = document.querySelector('section:first-of-type > h2 + blockquote');
assert.equal(firstBlockquoteEl?.innerText.trim(), 'Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?');
```
