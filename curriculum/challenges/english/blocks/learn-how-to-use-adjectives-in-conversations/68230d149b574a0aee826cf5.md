`Much more stable` means something is a lot more steady and dependable than before. For example:

`The new server is much more stable than the old one.` – It crashes less and works more reliably.

`Fewer` is the comparative form of `few`. It's used to show a smaller number of countable things. For example:

`We had fewer bugs in this release.` – The number of bugs was smaller than before.

`As much` means an equal or similar amount or degree. For example:

`The app doesn't freeze as much now.` – It freezes less often than it did before.
