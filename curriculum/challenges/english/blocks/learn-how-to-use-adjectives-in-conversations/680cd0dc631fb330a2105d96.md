<!-- SPEAKING -->

<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Yes, those cables were a bit short last time. We need something longer. Maybe twice as long as the ones we got before. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What would Josh most likely say if he agrees with Sarah's request?

## --answers--

`Understood.`

---

`Let's just keep the short ones.`

### --feedback--

This doesn't show agreement; Sarah clearly wants longer cables.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Understood` is a clear and polite way to show that Josh agrees and accepts Sarah's request without any argument.

It fits the situation where he is simply confirming her needs for longer cables.
