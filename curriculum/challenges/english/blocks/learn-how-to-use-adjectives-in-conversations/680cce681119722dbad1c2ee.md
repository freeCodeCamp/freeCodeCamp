`a bit short`

### --feedback--

This three-word phrase means slightly smaller in length or size than needed.

# --explanation--

`A bit short` means slightly not enough in size, length, or amount. For example:

`The network cables were a bit short, so they couldn't reach the server rack.` â€“ This shows the cables were just a little too small for the task.
