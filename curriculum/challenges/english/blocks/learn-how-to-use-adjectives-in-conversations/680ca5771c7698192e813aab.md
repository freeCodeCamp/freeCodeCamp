# --explanation--

`Those` is used to refer to multiple things that are not far away but not immediately close either.

`Right there` shows he is talking about something physically present and easy to see, not something random or in the past.

It shows he is talking about particular resistors they can both see, not about random items, past shipments, or plans.
