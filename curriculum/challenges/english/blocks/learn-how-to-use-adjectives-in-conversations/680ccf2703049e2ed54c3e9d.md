---

`as long as`

### --feedback--

This three-word phrase is used to compare the length of two things, showing they are the same in size.

# --explanation--

`Longer` means having more distance from end to end. For example:

`We need longer cables to reach the new server racks.` – This means cables with more length.

`Twice` means two times the amount. For example:

`We ordered twice the number of processors this time.` – This means double the quantity.

`As long as` is used for direct comparison in length. For example:

`The new cable is as long as the room.` – This shows the cable's length matches the size of the room.
