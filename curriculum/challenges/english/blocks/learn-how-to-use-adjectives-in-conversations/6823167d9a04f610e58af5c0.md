`Quite good at` means reasonably or fairly good at doing something. It shows that the performance or quality was above average. For example:  

`That tool is quite good at handling large files.` – It works well, though not perfect.

`Even better` is a comparative phrase that means one thing is an improvement over another that is already good. For example:  

`This version is even better than the last one.` – The new version has improved features or performance.
