# --explanation--

`Resistors` are electronic components that limit or control electric current in a circuit. For example:

`We installed new resistors to protect the circuit board.` – This means resistors were added to manage electricity.

`Right there` means something is located very close or easy to point out. For example:

`The server room is right there next to the office.` – This means it's close and easy to find.
