<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Could you take a look at it after the meeting? -->

# --description--

In making requests, `can` and `could` are both used, but they convey different levels of politeness. `Can` is more direct, while `could` is more polite and tentative. For example, `Can you help me?` is a straightforward request, whereas `Could you help me?` is a more polite, less imposing way to ask for assistance.
