# --explanation--

The verb `load` refers to the process of starting or initiating something, like software or a system. In this context, Sarah explains that if the hard drive is failing, the operating system won't start or become accessible. For example:

- `The program won't load because there's an error` means the program cannot start.

- `The page took a long time to load` refers to how long it takes for content to appear on a screen.
