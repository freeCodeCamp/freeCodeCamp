### --feedback--

These two words together refer to a situation where a program or application stops working unexpectedly. The first word refers to computer programs, and the second describes an abrupt failure.

# --explanation--

A `software crash` happens when a program stops working suddenly, often due to bugs, errors, or incompatibilities. For example:

- `A bug in the code led to the software crash.` - An error in the program caused it to stop functioning.

- `We need to fix the issue that caused the software crash.` - We have to solve the problem that made the program stop working.
