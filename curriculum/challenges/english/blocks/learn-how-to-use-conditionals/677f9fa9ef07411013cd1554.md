Think about how to express that something is possible. The first word suggests ability, and the second connects it to a condition or result.

# --explanation--

This sentence uses the `First Conditional` to describe a cause-and-effect relationship.

The phrase `if there's a software crash` describes the condition. The result, `it can be because of incompatible drivers or outdated software`, suggests a possible explanation for the crash.

Main clauses in conditionals often use modal verbs, like `can`, `could`, `may`, `should`, etc. For example:

- `If the system overheats, it can shut down automatically.` - Overheating always has the possibility of causing the system to turn off.

- `If users don't follow instructions, errors can occur.` - Not following guidelines always creates the possibility of errors.
