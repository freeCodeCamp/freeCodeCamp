# --explanation--

The correct sentence uses a `First Conditional` structure, which is formed with:

`if` + `Present Simple`: `If we lose critical data`.

Modal verb (`could`) + base verb: `it could set us back weeks`.


The `First Conditional` is used to describe a possible future event and its result.
