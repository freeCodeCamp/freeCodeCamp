# --explanation--

The correct answer, `It would be a big shock`, reflects a hypothetical reaction to Lisa's imagined scenario. This matches the `Second Conditional` structure of Lisa's question, which describes an unreal or unlikely possibility. Examples of similar responses:

These answers acknowledge the scenario and express imagined outcomes.
