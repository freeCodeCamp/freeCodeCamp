# --explanation--

`Disaster` refers to a very bad event or serious problem. For example:

- `The outdated software created a security disaster for the company.` - Old software led to major security issues for the organization.

- `Ignoring regular maintenance can turn small problems into a disaster.` - Skipping maintenance may escalate minor issues into serious ones.

In this dialogue, it means that forgetting to back up **could** cause significant trouble, such as losing critical data.
