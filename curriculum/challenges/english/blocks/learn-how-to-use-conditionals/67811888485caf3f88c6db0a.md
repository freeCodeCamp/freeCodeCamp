3

# --explanation--

Maria says, `at the end of each day`, which clearly indicates that the backups are scheduled daily. This means the task is planned to happen once every day. For example:

- `At the end of each day, the system runs a data backup.` - The system saves all data every evening to prevent loss.

- `We ensure the servers are updated at the end of each day.` - Updates are applied to servers nightly to avoid interruptions during working hours.
