<!-- (audio) Sarah: I did, but the problem seems to be more than just the power connection. Have you seen anything similar? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Mark has seen something similar. What can he answer?

## --answers--

`Yes, I have.`

---

`I will.`

### --feedback--

This is not the best answer. `I will` implies Mark will see something similar in the future, while Sarah is asking about past experience.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Sarah is asking if Mark's seen anything similar before. `Yes, I have`, confirms that he's had a similar experience in the past. If he hasn't, `No, I haven't` would work as well.
