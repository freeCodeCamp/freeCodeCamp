Maria decided to email Brian to talk about specific issues the team is experiencing with data backup procedures:

`Hi Brian,`

`I wanted to update you on the current status of our data backup procedures. Bob and I were discussing it, and it seems we're doing well with the daily reminders you helped set up. This ensures that our team backs up their work regularly, which is great!`

`However, Bob raised a point about minimizing human error, and we discussed the possibility of setting up automatic backups. If we automate the process, we can reduce the chances of forgetting, which would be a big win for us.`

`I suggested we could schedule automatic backups at the end of each day, which seems like a solid approach. Could you let us know if that's possible, or if there's anything else we should consider?`

`Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`

`Maria`

Maria clearly states that she and `Bob` have been discussing the backup procedures. Together, they identify the need to address `human error` and brainstorm potential solutions like automatic backups. This collaboration highlights teamwork in identifying and addressing challenges.

Focus on the fact that Maria specifically mentions Bob as her partner in this discussion, distinguishing him from Brian, who she seeks advice from.
