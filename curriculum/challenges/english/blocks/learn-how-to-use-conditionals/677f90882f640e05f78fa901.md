# --explanation--

The `Present Continuous` tense often emphasizes a temporary condition or an issue occurring at the moment of speaking. For example:

- `The server isn't running diagnostics.` - Highlights that the diagnostics process isn't happening right now.

- `Developers aren't debugging the application.` - Shows the developers aren't working on that activity at the moment.

`Properly` means doing something in the correct or expected way.

In this sentence, `aren't booting properly` refers to the computers currently not starting up correctly.
