<!-- (audio) Mark: Have you updated the drivers recently? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How should Sarah respond if she **hasn't updated** the drivers recently?

## --answers--

`Not yet.`

---

`I already did.`

### --feedback--

This would mean the drivers have already been updated, which doesn't match the situation.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Not yet` is a common way to express that an action hasn't been done but might happen in the future. It's polite and leaves the option open.
