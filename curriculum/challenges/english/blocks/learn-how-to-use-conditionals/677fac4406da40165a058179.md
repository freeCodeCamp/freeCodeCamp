The support team published a quick guide to troubleshooting boot issues:

`Having boot issues?`

`Troubleshooting computer issues can feel overwhelming, but understanding them can make the process easier. Here's a simple step-by-step checklist for diagnosing and fixing computer boot problems:`

`1. Check the power connection: If the power cable isn't securely connected, the computer won't turn on.`

`2. Inspect the BIOS: If the BIOS is corrupted, the system might fail to boot. You may need to reset or update it.`

`3. Examine the hard drive: If the hard drive is failing, the operating system won't load. Run diagnostic tools to confirm.`

`4. Update drivers: If the software crashes, it could be due to outdated or incompatible drivers. Always keep drivers updated to prevent this.`

`5. Watch out for memory leaks: If the application has memory leaks, it can slow down or crash the system. Look for signs like freezing or lagging.`

`Following these steps can help you identify the root cause and get things running smoothly again.`

# --explanation--

The guide starts by addressing the `power connection`, emphasizing that `if the power cable isn't securely connected, the computer won't turn on`. This foundational step is critical to rule out simple causes before proceeding to more complex diagnostics.

The checklist deliberately begins here because power issues are common and easy to resolve.

Focus on the part where the guide connects the symptom (`computer won't turn on`) to the solution (`check the power connection`), demonstrating the importance of starting with basic troubleshooting.
