# --explanation--

Lisa is using the `Second Conditional` to discuss a hypothetical situation.

The `Second Conditional` is used to talk about unreal or unlikely situations in the present or future. It follows the structure `if` + `Present Simple` or `Past Continuous` (for the condition) and `might / would / could` + base verb (for the result). For example:

- `If I had more time, I would learn a new programming language.` - This describes a hypothetical situation where having more time would lead to learning.

- `If the server were faster, it could handle more users.` - The server is not fast now, but if it were, it could support more users.
