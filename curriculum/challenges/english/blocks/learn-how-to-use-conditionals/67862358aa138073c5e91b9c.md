# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`If they BLANK out of business, it BLANK everything.`

## --blanks--

`go`

### --feedback--

This is the base verb used in the condition. It refers to the company ceasing operations.

---

`would change`

### --feedback--

This phrase expresses the result of the condition. `Would` shows the hypothetical outcome of the company going out of business.

# --explanation--

This sentence uses a `Mixed Conditional`, combining elements of the `First Conditional` (real possibility) and the `Second Conditional` (hypothetical result). Here's the structure:

`If` + `Present Simple` tense (real possibility): `If they go out of business` assumes the event is possible in the future.

`Would` + base verb (hypothetical result): `It would change everything` imagines the impact of this event.

Normally, the `First Conditional` uses `will` in the result (e.g., `If they go out of business, it will change everything`), focusing on real, probable outcomes. Here, `would` is used instead, blending the certainty of the condition with a hypothetical tone in the result. For example:

- `If she studies harder, she would pass the exam.` - The condition is realistic, but the result imagines what could happen.

- `If we leave now, we would avoid traffic.` - Real possibility of leaving now and hypothetical benefit in the result.
