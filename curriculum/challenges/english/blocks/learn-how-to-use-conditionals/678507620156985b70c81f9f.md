The correct response, `I read they might be having money problems`, directly answers Tom's question, `Why do you ask?` It provides a clear reason for bringing up the topic of TechCorp possibly going out of business.

When someone asks `Why do you ask?`, they are looking for a specific explanation or context for your question.

Other examples of responses to `Why do you ask?` could include:

- `I saw something about it in the news.`

- `I heard someone mention it in a meeting.`

These responses provide the necessary context and keep the conversation focused on the original question.
