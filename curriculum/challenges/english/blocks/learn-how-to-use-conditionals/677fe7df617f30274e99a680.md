# --explanation--

`Rely on` means to depend on someone or something for support, help, or trust. For example:

- `I rely on my phone to wake me up in the morning.` - You depend on your phone's alarm.

- `You can always rely on her advice.` - You can trust her advice because it's reliable.

In the audio, Bob is saying you don't need to depend on your memory because the reminder system helps you instead.
