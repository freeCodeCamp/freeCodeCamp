The support team published a quick guide to troubleshooting boot issues:

`Having boot issues?`

`Troubleshooting computer issues can feel overwhelming, but understanding them can make the process easier. Here's a simple step-by-step checklist for diagnosing and fixing computer boot problems:`

`1. Check the power connection: If the power cable isn't securely connected, the computer won't turn on.`

`2. Inspect the BIOS: If the BIOS is corrupted, the system might fail to boot. You may need to reset or update it.`

`3. Examine the hard drive: If the hard drive is failing, the operating system won't load. Run diagnostic tools to confirm.`

`4. Update drivers: If the software crashes, it could be due to outdated or incompatible drivers. Always keep drivers updated to prevent this.`

`5. Watch out for memory leaks: If the application has memory leaks, it can slow down or crash the system. Look for signs like freezing or lagging.`

`Following these steps can help you identify the root cause and get things running smoothly again.`
