## --text--

Maria decided to email Brian to talk about specific issues the team is experiencing with data backup procedures:

`Hi Brian,`

`I wanted to update you on the current status of our data backup procedures. Bob and I were discussing it, and it seems we're doing well with the daily reminders you helped set up. This ensures that our team backs up their work regularly, which is great!`

`However, Bob raised a point about minimizing human error, and we discussed the possibility of setting up automatic backups. If we automate the process, we can reduce the chances of forgetting, which would be a big win for us.`

`I suggested we could schedule automatic backups at the end of each day, which seems like a solid approach. Could you let us know if that's possible, or if there's anything else we should consider?`

`Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`

`Maria`
