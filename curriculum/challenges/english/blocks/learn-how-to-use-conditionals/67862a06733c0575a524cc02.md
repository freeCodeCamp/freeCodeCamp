# --explanation--

`Definitely` is used to express strong agreement or certainty. It means `without a doubt` or `absolutely`. For example:

- `This plan is definitely the best option.` - Shows complete certainty about the plan being the best choice.

- `I'll definitely be at the meeting tomorrow.` - Expresses confidence that the speaker will attend the meeting.

In this context, Tom uses it to fully agree with Lisa's statement about the significant impact of the company going out of business.
