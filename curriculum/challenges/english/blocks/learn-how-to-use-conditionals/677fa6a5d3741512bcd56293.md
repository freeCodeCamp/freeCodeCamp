`has`

### --feedback--

This verb is in the `Present Simple` and describes the existence of memory leaks.

# --explanation--

The `Present Simple` tense is often used to describe states or facts that are always true or currently valid.

In this sentence, `has` indicates a condition of the application â€” it currently possesses memory leaks. It is not describing an action but a state of existence. For example:

- `The software has bugs.` - The software is in a state of having bugs.

- `The application has memory leaks.` - The application is currently in a state where memory leaks exist.

An `application` is a software program designed to perform specific tasks or functions on a device. For example:

`I downloaded the application to manage my tasks.` - You installed the app on your device to organize your to-do list.
