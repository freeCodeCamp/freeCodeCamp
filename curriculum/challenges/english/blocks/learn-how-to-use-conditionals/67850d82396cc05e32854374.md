# --explanation--

A **tag question** is a short question added to the end of a sentence, used to confirm information or invite agreement. It is formed by:

- Taking the auxiliary verb (e.g., `would`, `is`, `has`, `will`) from the main sentence.

- Using the opposite form: positive to negative or negative to positive.

- Adding the appropriate pronoun.

In Lisa's sentence:

- The main clause is `It would affect a lot of tech companies` (positive).

- The tag is `wouldn't it?` (negative form of `would`).

This confirms the statement and invites agreement or feedback.
