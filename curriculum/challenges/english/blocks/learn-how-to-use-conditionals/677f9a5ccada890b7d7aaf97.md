<!-- (audio) Mark: Sometimes if the BIOS is corrupted, it prevents the computer from starting. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Sometimes BLANK the BIOS is corrupted, BLANK the computer from starting.`

## --blanks--

`if`

### --feedback--

This word introduces a condition.

---

`it prevents`

### --feedback--

The first word is a pronoun and the second is a verb that means to stop something from happening.

# --explanation--

The `Zero Conditional` is used for things that are always true when a condition is met. 

It follows the structure `if` + `Present Simple` (for the condition) and `Present Simple` (for the result). For example:

- `If you press the power button, the computer starts.` - Pressing the power button always turns on the computer.

- `If the internet is down, the website doesn't load.` - The website won't open if there's no internet connection.

In this dialogue, `if the BIOS is corrupted` is the condition, and `it prevents the computer from starting` is the result. This is a general truth about how corrupted BIOS affects the computer.
