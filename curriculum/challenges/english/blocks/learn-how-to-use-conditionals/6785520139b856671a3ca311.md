# --explanation--

The word `some` means `a part of` or `not all`. For example:

- `Some of the team members are working remotely.` - Not all team members, just a part of them.

- `She bought some new books to prepare for the exam.` - A few books, not all the books available.

Using `some` highlights that while TechCorp is important to smaller companies, it doesn't fund all their projects, just a portion of them. This is why losing TechCorp would still have a significant impact.
