# --explanation--

`Have you checked?` is a question in the `Present Perfect` tense. It is used to ask if someone has done something recently or at some point before now. For example:

- `Have you checked the weather forecast?` - This asks if you've looked at it recently.

- `Have you checked your email?` - This means asking if you've looked at your inbox.

In this dialogue, `have you checked` asks whether Maria has reviewed or verified something. It implies the action may affect the present, such as ensuring the backup procedures are up-to-date.
