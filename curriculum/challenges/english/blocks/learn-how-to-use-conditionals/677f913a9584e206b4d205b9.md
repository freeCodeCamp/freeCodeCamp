# --explanation--

The `Present Simple` tense often refers to actions or situations that are true all the time, rather than temporary occurrences. For example:

- `The system updates automatically every night.` - Refers to a scheduled routine that happens regularly.

- `The app saves data to the cloud.` - States a general fact about the app's functionality.

`Securely` means something is fastened, positioned, or done in a way that ensures safety or proper functioning.

In this sentence, `isn't connected securely` refers to a state where the power cable is not attached properly, preventing the computer from turning on.
