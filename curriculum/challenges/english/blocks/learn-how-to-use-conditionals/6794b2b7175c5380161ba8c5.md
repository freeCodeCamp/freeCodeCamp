# --explanation--

Let's look at how the audio gives you clues to answer the question:  

In `set up a reminder`, the word `reminder` tells you the tasks are important. If they weren't, there wouldn't be a need to remember them.  

The word `daily` shows that at least one task, backing up work, needs to be done regularly.  

These words help you understand that the tasks Maria is talking about are important and need to be done regularly. They're not optional or already completed. They are ongoing and require attention.
