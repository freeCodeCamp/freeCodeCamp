# --explanation--

When someone ends a question with `right`, they are seeking agreement or confirmation. This is common in everyday conversations to check if the other person agrees or understands.

If you want to confirm someone's statements you can use phrases like:

- `Yes, you're correct.`

- `That's true.`
