## --text--

Maria decided to email Brian to talk about specific issues the team is experiencing with data backup procedures:

`Hi Brian,`

`I wanted to update you on the current status of our data backup procedures. Bob and I were discussing it, and it seems we're doing well with the daily reminders you helped set up. This ensures that our team backs up their work regularly, which is great!`

`However, Bob raised a point about minimizing human error, and we discussed the possibility of setting up automatic backups. If we automate the process, we can reduce the chances of forgetting, which would be a big win for us.`

`I suggested we could schedule automatic backups at the end of each day, which seems like a solid approach. Could you let us know if that's possible, or if there's anything else we should consider?`

`Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`

`Maria`

# --explanation--

Maria proposes scheduling backups `at the end of each day`. She explicitly mentions this frequency as a solid approach to ensure all work from the day is securely saved. This daily schedule provides consistency and reduces the risk of data loss.

Pay attention to her phrasing, which reflects a practical solution designed to balance automation with the team's existing workflow.
