# --description--

Now create another `if` statement that uses `isTimmyAGamer` as its condition. Inside the body of your `if` statement, log `"Timmy loves to play World of Warcraft."` to the console.

Note that you won't see anything logged to the console as the condition of your new `if` statement is false.

# --hints--

You should have two `if` statements in your code.

```js

```

Your second `if` statement should use `isTimmyAGamer` as its condition.

```js

```

You should log `"Timmy loves to play World of Warcraft."` to the console within your second `if` statement.

```js

```

# --seed--

const hasDeveloperJob = true;

if (hasDeveloperJob) {
  console.log("Timmy is employed as a developer.");
