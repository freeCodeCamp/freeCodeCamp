# --explanation--

`SQL injection attacks` are a type of cyber attack where hackers insert harmful code into a database query to access or damage data. For example:

`The company added security measures to prevent SQL injection attacks on their website.` - This means they took steps to stop hackers from entering harmful code.  

Jake says the `additional measures` are needed to `prevent SQL injection attacks`, meaning they are trying to stop this specific type of threat.
