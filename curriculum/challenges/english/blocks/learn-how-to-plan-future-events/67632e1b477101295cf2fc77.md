# --explanation--

Jake says, `This will help us catch any suspicious patterns early.` Let's break down what he means.

`Help us catch` means to make it easier for the team to find or notice something. 

`Suspicious patterns` refers to activities or changes in the database that seem unusual or could signal potential problems, such as unauthorized access or errors in the data. 

`Early` means finding these patterns as soon as possible, before they can cause significant harm.

Together, Jake's statement means that by monitoring the database closely, the team can quickly find and fix any unusual activity before it becomes a bigger issue.
