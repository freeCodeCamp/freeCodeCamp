# --explanation--
 
`Anything` means any item, task, or thing. 

`Else` means in addition to what has already been mentioned.  

Together, `anything else` means "any other things". For example:

- `Do you need anything else before I leave?` - This asks if the person needs more help or items.  

- `Is there anything else on the agenda?` - This asks if there are more topics to discuss.  

Maria says, `Is there anything else we need to do?` This shows she wants to know if there are more tasks she needs to do beyond informing the team.
