# --explanation--

A `timetable` is a schedule that outlines the times and dates of planned events or activities. In this context, Jake refers to a timetable for the system update, and Maria mentions reviewing it, showing she is prepared. For example:

- `The timetable for the train is posted at the station.` - This means the schedule for train arrivals and departures is available for reference.

- `We created a timetable to organize our project milestones.` - This means a schedule was set up to track when each project goal should be achieved.
