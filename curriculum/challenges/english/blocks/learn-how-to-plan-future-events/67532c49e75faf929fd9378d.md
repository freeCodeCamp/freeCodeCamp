`I'll` is the contraction for `I will`. It is commonly used to express decisions made at the moment of speaking or to indicate future actions. For example:

- `I'll help you with your project.` - This means offering help immediately after hearing about the need.

The contraction makes the sentence shorter and more natural in spoken English.
