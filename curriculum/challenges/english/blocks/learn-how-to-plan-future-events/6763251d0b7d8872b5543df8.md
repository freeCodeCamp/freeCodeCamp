# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on Maria's words in the audio:

`I'm going to` shows her plan for the future.

`Inform the team` tell us what Maria is planning to do.

Maria's exact plan is to inform the team about something specific. 

`Upcoming` means something that will happen soon. For example: 

`We have an upcoming meeting next week.` - This means the meeting is scheduled for the near future.

`Upcoming training` means a training session that is planned to take place soon.

Together, the phrase shows Maria's responsibility to give information about the training that will happen in the near future.
