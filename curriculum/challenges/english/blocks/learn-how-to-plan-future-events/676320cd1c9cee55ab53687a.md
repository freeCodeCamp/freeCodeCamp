Next week

## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, pay attention to the words that come after `hold a session`. Jake says, `next week`, which tells you the session will happen in the week after this one.

`Next week` means the week following the current one. For instance, if today is Tuesday, `next week` starts on the following Sunday or Monday.
