# --explanation--

Pay attention to the words `will affect` and `deadlines` in the audio. These are key to understanding the question.

A `project deadline` is the final date by which a project must be completed.

`Will affect` is used to ask if something will cause a change or impact. For example:

`The new policy will affect the project deadline.` - This means the policy will change the timeline for the project.
