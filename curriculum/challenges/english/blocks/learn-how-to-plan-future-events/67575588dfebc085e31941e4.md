`Hidden` means something that is concealed or not immediately visible, often requiring extra effort to find. 
 
`Malware` refers to malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or exploit a computer system.  

When combined, `hidden malware` describes harmful software that is difficult to detect because it is concealed within the system. For example:

`The scan detected hidden malware that had bypassed the antivirus software.` - This means the malware was able to avoid detection by the antivirus program until a scan found it.
