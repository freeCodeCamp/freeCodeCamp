# --explanation--

Jake says, `I'll update the project manager`, this shows that Jake is talking about something he plans to do in the future, not something happening now or that has already been done. For example:

- `I'll send the email tomorrow.` - This means sending the email is planned for the future.

- `He'll call the client after the meeting.` - This shows a plan to contact the client later.
