<!-- (Audio) Maria: Perfect. And the training session for the new security protocols, when is that planned? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What's the best answer to Maria's question?

## --answers--

`The training is planned for Thursday afternoon.`

---

`The training will be planned for Thursday afternoon.`

### --feedback--

This uses the `Future Simple` tense, which suggests the plan has not been made yet. Maria's question assumes the training is already scheduled.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Maria's question, `when is that planned?`, uses the `Present Simple` tense (`is planned`) to ask about a fixed future event. 

The `Present Simple` is commonly used for schedules, timetables, or planned events because it gives a sense of certainty. For example:

`The bus leaves at 9 AM tomorrow.` - This shows a fixed schedule.
