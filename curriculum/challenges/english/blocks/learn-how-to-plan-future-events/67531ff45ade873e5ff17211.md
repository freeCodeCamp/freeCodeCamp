# --explanation--

`Immediate action` means doing something without delay because it is urgent. For example:

`We need to take immediate action to stop the leak.` - This shows the situation is urgent, and action must be taken quickly.

In this context, Jake says `immediate action`, which indicates he is worried and believes the phishing attack is a serious issue that requires quick response. The words `notify the team` also show he is treating the matter with importance.
