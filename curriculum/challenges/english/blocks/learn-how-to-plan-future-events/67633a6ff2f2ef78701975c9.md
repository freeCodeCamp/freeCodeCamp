# --explanation--

`After we've completed` indicates that Jake is planning to share the information once the training is finished. Let's break it down: 

`After` shows the sequence of events, meaning the information will be shared following the training.  

`Completed the training` means finishing the training sessions or program.

Together, this means Jake's plan is to share the information only once the training is fully done.
