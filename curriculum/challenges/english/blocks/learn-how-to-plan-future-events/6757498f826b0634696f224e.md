# --explanation--

Jake uses `might`, `won't`, and `should` to express his thoughts about possibilities, plans, and actions in the future.

`Might` shows possibility or uncertainty: Jake thinks there's a chance that delays could happen but isn't certain.

`Won't` is the contraction for `will not`: Jake hopes delays will not happen, expressing his desire for a positive outcome.

`Should` is used to make a recommendation: Jake suggests preparing for delays as a practical step, even though he hopes they won't happen.

This combination shows how Jake is reflecting on the future: acknowledging uncertainty (`might`), expressing hope (`won't`), and making a plan to act (`should`).
