# --explanation--

`This` and `next` help clarify if an event is scheduled soon or further in the future. 

In this case, `this Saturday at 2 AM` refers to the upcoming Saturday and a specific early morning time chosen to minimize disruption. For example:

- `The meeting is scheduled for this Friday at 9 AM.` - This means the meeting is set for the closest Friday at 9 AM.

- `Our next session is next Tuesday at 4 PM.` - This means the session will occur on the Tuesday following this week, at 4 PM.
