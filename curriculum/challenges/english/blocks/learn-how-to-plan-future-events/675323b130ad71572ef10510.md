The entire team

### --feedback--

The audio does not mention the entire team needing to act.

## --video-solution--

3

# --explanation--

In the audio, Jake uses the word `someone`, which means he is not specifying a particular person who needs to act. The word `someone` helps identify that the responsibility is not assigned to Jake, Sarah, or the entire team.

Listen for the phrase `someone will need to notify`. This is a key part of the sentence that points out the correct answer.
