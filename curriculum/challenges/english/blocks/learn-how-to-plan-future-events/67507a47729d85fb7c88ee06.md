# --explanation--

`Is planned` uses the `Present Simple` tense to describe a future event that is already scheduled. It indicates certainty about when the training will happen, not that it has already occurred. For example:

`The meeting is planned for next Monday.` - This shows that the meeting is scheduled for the future.
