This is a message Jake sent to his team:

`Hi Team,`

`Here is the checklist for the upcoming system update. All tasks must be completed on time:`  

`- Thursday afternoon: The training session for the new security protocols is planned.`  
`- Friday afternoon: All security patches are ready to be deployed.`  
`- Friday evening: The final system checks are set.`  
`- Saturday at 2 AM: The system update is scheduled to start, with server downtime lasting two hours.`  
`- During the update: The support team is on call to manage any immediate issues.`  

`Firewall settings are enhanced by Friday to prevent potential DoS attacks. Let me know if there are any questions!`

What happens if the final system checks are not completed by Friday?

## --answers--

The server downtime will last longer.

### --feedback--

The server downtime is scheduled to last two hours and is not directly impacted by the final checks.

### --feedback--

The training session takes place on Thursday, unrelated to the timing of the final checks.

---

The system update might be delayed.

---

Immediate issues won't be resolved.

Immediate issues are handled by the support team during the update, not by the final system checks.

# --explanation--

To understand what might happen if the final system checks are not completed, consider their role in preparing for the update. 

Final checks ensure readiness for the system update, so their delay could lead to postponing the update. 

Look for the phrase `The final system checks are set` to confirm this connection.
