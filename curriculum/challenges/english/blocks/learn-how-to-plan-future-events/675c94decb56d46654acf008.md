# --explanation--

`Likely be` suggests this is a probable outcome, though not certain.

`Concerned` means feeling worried or anxious about something. In this context, Jake predicts that the clients will feel worried about the news. For example:

- `The team was concerned about meeting the deadline.` - This shows they were worried about achieving their goal. 
 
- `Our clients were concerned about the system's performance.` - This indicates they were anxious about how well the system was functioning.
