# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

When does the server downtime start?

## --answers--

When the user traffic is at its peak.

### --feedback--

Consider whether downtime would be planned when the server is most active. Think about when the least disruption would occur.

---

When the user traffic is at its lowest.

---

When the server needs a reboot.

### --feedback--

Maria does not mention any specific technical need like a reboot. Focus on what she says about traffic.

---

When new features are added.

### --feedback--

Maria is talking about downtime related to user traffic, not updates or feature additions. Pay attention to the context of the sentence.

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Maria states that the server downtime starts when `the user traffic is at its lowest`. This indicates the downtime is planned for a time with minimal user activity, likely to reduce the impact on users.
