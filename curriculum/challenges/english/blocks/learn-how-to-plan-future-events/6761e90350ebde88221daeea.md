---

Additional measures

---

Less security

## --video-solution--

3

# --explanation--

`Additional measures` refers to extra actions or steps taken to fix or improve something. For example:

`We need additional measures to protect the system from future attacks.` - This means more steps are necessary to improve the system's safety.

Jake says they need additional measures, meaning more steps are required to improve the database security.
