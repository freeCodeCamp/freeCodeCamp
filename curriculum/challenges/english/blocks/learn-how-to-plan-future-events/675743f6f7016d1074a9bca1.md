`It might. I hope it BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`won't`

This is the contraction for `will not`.

# --explanation--

`Won't` is the contraction for `will not`, which is used to make negative sentences about the future. For example:

- `They won't finish the project on time if they don't start now.` - This predicts a negative outcome if action isn't taken.

- `He won't attend the meeting because he is sick.` - This shows a future action that will not happen.
