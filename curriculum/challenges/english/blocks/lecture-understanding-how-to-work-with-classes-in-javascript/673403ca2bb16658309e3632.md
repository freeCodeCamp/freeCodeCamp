# --interactive--

You learned that classes are like blueprints that you can use to create objects.

These blueprints need a general way to refer to the specific object that is being created, accessed, or modified within the code. That's exactly what the `this` keyword is used for. It refers to the context where the code is supposed to run. If you use it within a method, the value of `this` will be a reference to the object associated with that method. This allows you to access the properties and methods of the object within the class and reuse the method on different objects.

For example, here we have a `Dessert` class. This time, we're defining a `hasPeanuts` property.

```js
class Dessert {
  constructor(hasPeanuts) {
    this.hasPeanuts = hasPeanuts;
  }
}
````

Notice that we're using the `this` keyword within the constructor. Remember that the constructor is called automatically when a new object of the class is created.

The `this` keyword is telling the program that `hasPeanuts` should be a property of the object that is currently being created. The right-hand side assigns the value of the `hasPeanuts` parameter to the `hasPeanuts` property of the new object.

```js
this.hasPeanuts = hasPeanuts;
```

You can also use the `this` keyword within other methods.

Here is our `Dessert` class with a few changes. Now it has two properties: `name` and `price`.

```js
class Dessert {
  constructor(name, price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  showPrice() {
    console.log(`The price of ${this.name} is $${this.price}.`);
  }
}
```

We also added a `showPrice` method. In this method, we print a descriptive message to the console with the name and price of the dessert object. Notice how we're using `this` to access the properties of the object.

What value will `this` have in the context of this method? It will refer to the object on which the method is being called. In this case, we are creating a `Dessert` instance with the name `"Brownie"` and the price `5.99`:

```js
const brownie = new Dessert("Brownie", 5.99);
```

If we call the `.showPrice()` method on this object:

```js
brownie.showPrice();
```

Here is the full example:

The name and price of the current object (`brownie`) are replaced in the string. This works because the `this` keyword gives you a general way to refer to the current object. This allows the method to be reused on different objects.

The `this` keyword also has a value in standalone functions and arrow functions. In a standalone function, it typically refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).

Arrow functions behave differently. They inherit the value of `this` from the surrounding scope where they are defined. They do not create their own `this` binding. This makes arrow functions useful for callbacks or preserving context.

However, because of this, `this` will not refer to the current object when using arrow functions as object methods. This is something to keep in mind when choosing between regular functions and arrow functions.

The same applies to arrow functions defined inside other functions. They inherit the value of `this` from their parent scope.

Understanding how `this` works is essential for working with objects in JavaScript.
