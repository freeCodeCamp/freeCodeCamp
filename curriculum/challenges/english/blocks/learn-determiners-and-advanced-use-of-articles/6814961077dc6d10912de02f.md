---

`that level`

### --feedback--

This phrase points to a specific stage or degree. Don't forget to use a demonstrative determiner pointing to a specific, mentioned level of integration.

`The smaller projects` uses `the` because it refers to specific projects that have already been discussed.

`That level` uses `that` to point to a particular standard of integration, not just any level.
