# --instructions--

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK provider has data centers in Europe, giving better data privacy but at BLANK higher price.`

## --blanks--

`The other`

### --feedback--

These two words refer to the second option in a group of two. The first letter of the first word is capitalized.

---

`a`

### --feedback--

This article is used before a general, singular noun like `price`.

# --explanation--

`The other` is used when talking about the second of two choices. Since Jake already mentioned one provider, this is the second one.

`A higher price` refers to a non-specific cost, so you use `a` (indefinite article). It is one possible price level.
