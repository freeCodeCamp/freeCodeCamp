`Cloud storage` is a type of digital storage that allows data to be saved and accessed over the internet. It is useful when teams work across different locations. For example:

`Cloud storage helps us access data from anywhere.` - The team can open their files from any device with the internet.

`Needs` are things that are required. `Capacity and security needs` refer to how much space and protection the system must have to handle company data. For example:

`As the team grows, our capacity and security needs also increase.` - They need more space and better data protection now.
