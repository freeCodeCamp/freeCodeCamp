# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Maybe we could allocate BLANK developers to them instead, to help speed up BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`another two`

### --feedback--

---

`the basic development`

### --feedback--

This refers to a specific stage of the project. Don't forget to use an article if necessary.

# --explanation--

`Another two` means two more in addition to those already assigned. `Another` can be used before numbers. For example:

- `We'll need another four developers to finish the project on time.` - They need four more people to help complete the project.

- `Can you wait another three days for the update?` - Someone is asking if it's okay to delay for three more days.

`The basic development` uses `the` because it refers to a specific phase of the work - the early or foundational stage already known to the team.
