## --blanks--

`real situations`

### --feedback--

These two words refer to different situations in the real world (general, not specific). Use the plural form.

---

`better insights`

### --feedback--

These two words refer to different types of better understanding (general). Use the plural form.

---

`its`

### --feedback--

This possessive determiner shows that the performance belongs to the European provider.

# --explanation--

`Its` is a possessive determiner used to show that something belongs to a thing (not a person). Notice there's no apostrophe. Here, `its performance` means the performance of the European provider.

No article is used before `real situations` or `better insights` because they are plural, general ideas.

You normally do not use articles when talking about general, plural nouns.
