After talking with Alice, Bob decided to email the team with assigned tasks:

`Subject: Task Assignments for New Mobile App Project`

`Hi team,`

`As we begin work on our new mobile app project, I wanted to share the initial task assignments based on everyone's experience and strengths. Here's how we're dividing the work:`

- `Sarah will handle user authentication, since she has the most experience in that area.`

- `Tom will focus on payment integration.`

- `New developers will be paired with more experienced team members to help with onboarding and avoid unnecessary stress.`

`Alice is preparing a list of technical requirements for each part of the project to guide development.`

`We'll have bi-weekly meetings to check progress and address any issues to avoid delays.`

`On the QA side, we recognize we're short on testers. I'll reach out to HR to explore bringing in additional QA support, especially for the more complex features.`

`Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Let's make sure everyone is clear on their responsibilities by the end of this week.`

`Best,`

`Bob`
