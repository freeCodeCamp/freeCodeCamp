<!-- (Audio) Jake: We'll track key performance details and get feedback from the team. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Why does Jake say `the team` and not just `team`?

## --answers--

Because `team` always needs `the` before them.

### --feedback--

Not every `team` needs `the` - only when the group is specific.

---

Because he talks about a specific team everyone knows.

---

Because `team` is an uncountable noun.

### --feedback--

`Team` is a countable noun.

---

Because `team` is always plural.

### --feedback--

`Team` can be singular or plural, depending on context.

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Jake uses `the team` because he is referring to a specific group - the team that Maria, Jake, and others already know. Use `the` with known groups:

- `The students presented their projects.` - This means a specific group of students.

- `The team finished the project on time.` - This means a known team.
