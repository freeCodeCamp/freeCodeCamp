`the`

### --feedback--

This article is used because the features have already been introduced or are known to the speakers.

# --explanation--

`Enough QA people` means having a sufficient number of quality assurance workers - `QA` stands for `Quality Assurance`, meaning the team that tests the app for problems. For example:

- Person 1: `We found more bugs after the release.`

- Person 2: `Maybe we didn't have enough QA people testing it.` - This person is suggesting that the testing team was too small, so they couldn't catch all the bugs.

`The new features` uses `the` because the features they are talking about are specific and part of the project plan.
