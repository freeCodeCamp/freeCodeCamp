<!-- (Audio) Maria: Exactly, James. I'll make a plan for resource allocation and share it with you tomorrow. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Did Maria use the correct article to talk about her plan?

## --answers--

Yes, she used `a` because it's the first time the plan is mentioned.

---

No, she should have said `the` because everyone knows the plan already.

### --feedback--

`The` is for something already known. This is the first mention of the plan.

---

No, she shouldn't have used any article at all.

### --feedback--

An article is needed here because it introduces a singular countable noun.

---

Yes, but only because the sentence includes `resource`.

### --feedback--

Focus on `plan`, not `resource`.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Maria says `a plan for resource allocation` - the article `a` is correct because she's introducing a single, new idea that hasn't been mentioned before.
