`our`

### --feedback--

This possessive determiner shows that the customers belong to Jake's team or company.

# --explanation--

`The European option` uses the definite article `the` because it's a specific option they've already mentioned (in contrast to the U.S. option).

`Our European customers` uses `our` to show ownership or relationship - these customers are part of Jake's company network.
