As said previously, Maria made a plan for resource allocation:

`Resource Allocation Plan: Q2 Overview`

`Objective: To distribute resources effectively across all active projects while maintaining focus on key priorities and avoiding team burnout.`

`1. Server Capacity Allocation: 50% of total server capacity will be allocated to the main project, as it is essential for meeting our yearly goals. The remaining 50% will support the two smaller initiatives.`

`2. Developer Allocation: No additional developers are available until next month. Advanced analytics tools will not be provided to smaller projects at this stage - they are not yet ready for integration. Instead, we will explore the possibility of assigning part-time contractors or rebalancing tasks among current team members.`

`3. Working Hours: We will not extend working hours, as this could lead to burnout among developers and project managers. All shifts will remain as they are unless we receive voluntary support.`

`4. Task Distribution & Communication: Task changes must be communicated clearly to all teams. Project leads are responsible for ensuring no critical tasks are overlooked.`

`Next Steps:`

- `Final review of this plan: Friday`

- `Adjustments (if needed) will be made with James before team-wide presentation.`

Server capacity was divided fairly, but analytics tool allocation depends on project maturity.

# --explanation--

Focus on the sentence that starts with `Advanced analytics tools will not be...`.

Maria explains that smaller projects are not yet ready for integration with advanced analytics tools, so these tools will not be provided at this stage.
