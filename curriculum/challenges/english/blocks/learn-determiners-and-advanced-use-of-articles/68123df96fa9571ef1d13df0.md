# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`That's BLANK great idea. We have BLANK features to work on, and BLANK developers have different skills.`

## --blanks--

`a`

### --feedback--

This article is used because `great idea` is singular and mentioned for the first time.

---

`many`

### --feedback--

This quantifier is used to talk about a large number of countable items (like `features`).

---

`our`

### --feedback--

This possessive determiner shows that the `developers` belong to Alice's team.

# --explanation--

`A great idea` uses `a` because it introduces a new, singular thing.

`Many features` uses `many` because it refers to a large number of countable things.

`Our developers` uses `our` to show ownership - the developers are part of Alice's group.
