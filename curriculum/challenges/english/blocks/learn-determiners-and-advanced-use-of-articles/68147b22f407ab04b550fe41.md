# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`As we look at BLANK ahead, we need to distribute BLANK carefully.`

## --blanks--

`the quarter`

### --feedback--

This refers to a known period of three months ahead in the business calendar. Don't forget to use an article if necessary.

---

`our resources`

### --feedback--

This refers to things that are needed to complete work. Don't forget to use a possessive determiner that shows the resources belong to Maria's team.

# --explanation--

`Quarter` means one-fourth of a year (three months), often used in business planning. Here, it uses `the` because it refers to a specific, known period of time. Another example:

`We need to finish the project by the end of the quarter.` - The deadline is the end of the current three-month period.

`Resources` are things like money, time, tools, or people that are needed to complete work. Here, it uses `our` because Maria is talking about resources owned or managed by her team. Another example:

`We need to manage our resources more efficiently.` - They should use their time, money, or people in a smarter way.
