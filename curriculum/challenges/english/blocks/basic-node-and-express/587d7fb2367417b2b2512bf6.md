# --description--

Another common way to get input from the client is by encoding the data after the route path, using a query string. The query string is delimited by a question mark (?), and includes field=value couples. Each couple is separated by an ampersand (&). Express can parse the data from the query string, and populate the object `req.query`. Some characters, like the percent (%), cannot be in URLs and have to be encoded in a different format before you can send them. If you use the API from JavaScript, you can use specific methods to encode/decode these characters.

<blockquote>route_path: '/library'<br>actual_request_URL: '/library?userId=546&#x26;bookId=6754' <br>req.query: {userId: '546', bookId: '6754'}</blockquote>

# --instructions--

Build an API endpoint, mounted at `GET /name`. Respond with a JSON document, taking the structure `{ name: 'firstname lastname'}`. The first and last name parameters should be encoded in a query string e.g. `?first=firstname&last=lastname`.

**Note:** In the following exercise you are going to receive data from a POST request, at the same `/name` route path. If you want, you can use the method `app.route(path).get(handler).post(handler)`. This syntax allows you to chain different verb handlers on the same path route. You can save a bit of typing, and have cleaner code.

# --hints--

Test 1 : Your API endpoint should respond with `{ "name": "Mick Jagger" }` when the `/name` endpoint is called with `?first=Mick&last=Jagger`

```js
  $.get(code + '/name?first=Mick&last=Jagger').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(
        data.name,
        'Mick Jagger',
        'Test 1: "GET /name" route does not behave as expected'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```

Test 2 : Your API endpoint should respond with `{ "name": "Keith Richards" }` when the `/name` endpoint is called with `?first=Keith&last=Richards`

```js
  $.get(code + '/name?last=Richards&first=Keith').then(
    (data) => {
      assert.equal(
        data.name,
        'Keith Richards',
        'Test 2: "GET /name" route does not behave as expected'
      );
    },
    (xhr) => {
      throw new Error(xhr.responseText);
    }
  );
```
