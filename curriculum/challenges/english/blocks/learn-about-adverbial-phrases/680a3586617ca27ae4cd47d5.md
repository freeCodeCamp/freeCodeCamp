# --explanation--

`To see how something goes` means to observe the results or progress of a situation over time, especially when trying something new. It suggests being open to learning what happens and making decisions based on that outcome. For example:

- `Let's try this schedule for a week and see how it goes.` – This means testing the schedule to find out if it works well.

- `We'll invite a few users to the beta test and see how it goes before launching it publicly.` – This means watching how the first test goes to decide what to do next.
