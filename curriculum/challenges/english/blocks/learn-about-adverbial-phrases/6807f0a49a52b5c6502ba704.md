# --explanation--

`No matter` means regardless of or despite any conditions. It indicates that the outcome is not affected by various factors. For example:

`She always arrives on time, no matter the traffic.` â€“ This means she arrives on time, even if there is heavy traffic.

Here, Bob means the app should work smoothly regardless of where the user is located.
