# --explanation--

`At the beginning` is an adverbial phrase that refers to the early stage of something — when something is just starting. It helps show the time or point at which an action or situation occurs. For example:

`At the beginning of the meeting, we discussed the new schedule.` – This means the schedule was talked about during the first part of the meeting.
