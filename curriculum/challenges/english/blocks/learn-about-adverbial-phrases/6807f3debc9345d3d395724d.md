# --explanation--

`Central servers` refer to powerful computers or systems that manage and store data for a network, making it accessible to multiple users or devices. These servers are typically located in a central location and handle tasks like data processing, storage, and communication. For example:

`The company uses central servers to host all their internal applications.` â€“ This means that the company stores and runs its applications on servers in a single central location.
