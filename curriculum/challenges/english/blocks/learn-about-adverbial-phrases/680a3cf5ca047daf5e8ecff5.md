This is used to show that something happens earlier in time than something else.

# --explanation--

`Before` is used to show that one action happens earlier than another. For example:

- `Please save your work before you close the program.` – This means saving should happen earlier than closing the program.

- `He always checks his code carefully before submitting it.` – This means checking happens first, before the action of submitting.
