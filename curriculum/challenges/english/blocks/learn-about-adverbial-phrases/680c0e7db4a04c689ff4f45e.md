After talking to Maria, Riker comes up with a draft for the strategy to show to the team:

### `Social Media Campaign Strategy`

`For our next social media campaign, we will focus on these key areas to improve our results:`

`Improve Engagement in Asia:`

- `Create local content: Use local languages and cultural references to make content more relevant.`

- `Work with influencers: Partner with local influencers to reach a wider audience.`

- `Track performance: Regularly check results and adjust the strategy if needed.`

`Manage the Budget:`

- `Plan by region: Allocate the budget based on the cost in each region (e.g., ads may cost more in Europe).`

- `Avoid overspending: Keep track of spending to stay within budget.`

- `Use cost-effective methods: Consider organic posts or partnerships instead of paid ads.`

`Continue Successful Strategies in Europe:`

- `Maintain success in the UK and Germany: Continue the same content style and focus on the same audience.`

- `Measure performance: Track how the campaign is doing and make adjustments if necessary.`

`Adapt Content for Local Markets:`

- `Personalize content: Create different versions of the campaign for each region.`

- `Test content: Try different images, headlines, and messages to see what works best.`

`By following these steps, we can improve performance, stay within budget, and engage more people across regions.`
