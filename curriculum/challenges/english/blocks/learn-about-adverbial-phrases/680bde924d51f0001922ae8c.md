# --explanation--

`To be based on something` means that an idea, plan, or decision uses that thing as its foundation or starting point. It shows what influences or shapes the final choice. For example:

- `Their new pricing model is based on customer feedback.` – This means they created the prices by using customers' opinions and suggestions.

- `The movie is based on a true story.` – This means the real story inspired the events shown in the movie.
