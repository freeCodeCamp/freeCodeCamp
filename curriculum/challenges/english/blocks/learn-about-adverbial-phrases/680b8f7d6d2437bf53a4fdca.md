# --explanation--

`Not very` + adjective is often used to soften a negative description. Instead of directly saying something was `bad` or `ineffective`, speakers might say `not very effective` to sound more polite or less harsh. For example:

- `The meeting was not very helpful.` – This is a softer way of saying the meeting did not help the team at all.

- `His presentation wasn't very clear.` – This is more gentle than saying it was confusing or bad.
