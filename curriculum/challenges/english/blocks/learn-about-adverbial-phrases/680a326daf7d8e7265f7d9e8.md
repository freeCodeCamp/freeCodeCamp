Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I see. Maybe we should start BLANK and see how it goes.`

## --blanks--

`small`

### --feedback--

This means limited or simple, not very big or complex.

# --explanation--

`To start small` means to begin with a simple, limited, or smaller version of something before expanding or scaling up. It's often used to reduce risk and learn from early steps. For example:

- `Let's start small with just one feature and build more later.` – This means to begin with a single part of the project to test or learn before adding more.

- `The company started small with only two employees but grew quickly.` – This means the business began with a small team before expanding.
