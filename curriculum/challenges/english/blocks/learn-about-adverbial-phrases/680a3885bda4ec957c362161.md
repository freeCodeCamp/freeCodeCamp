# --explanation--

`That sounds good` is a common and friendly way to show that you agree with or approve of a suggestion. It means that the idea seems like a good one after hearing it. For example:

- Person 1: `Let's meet at 3 p.m. to go over the final details.` - Person 1 suggests a meeting to check details.

- Person 2: `That sounds good.` - This means the speaker thinks the plan or idea is acceptable and agrees to it.
