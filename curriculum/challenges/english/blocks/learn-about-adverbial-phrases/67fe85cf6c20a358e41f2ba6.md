<!-- (Audio) Bob: How about we switch to biweekly detailed updates unless there's a significant development? -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`How about we BLANK to biweekly detailed updates BLANK there's a significant development?`

## --blanks--

`switch`

### --feedback--

This means to change or move from one thing to another.

---

`unless`

### --feedback--

This introduces an exception or condition that prevents the action from happening.

# --explanation--

`Switch` means to change or change from one state, system, or method to another. For example:

`We should switch to using email for all important communications.` – This means changing the method of communication to email.

In this context, Bob is suggesting changing the frequency of the updates. 

`Unless` would be the same as `except if`. It is used to introduce an exception or condition that must be true for the main action to not happen. For example:

`I will attend the meeting unless I have a conflicting appointment.` – This means you will go to the meeting unless there's something else that prevents you, such as another appointment.

You could say the same using `if` and a negative statement with `I will attend the meeting if I don't have a conflicting appointment.`
