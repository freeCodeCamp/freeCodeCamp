# --explanation--

`Fully` means completely or entirely. For example:

- `The app isn't fully ready for launch.` – This means the app is not completely finished or prepared yet.

- `She fully explained the process during the meeting.` – This means she gave a complete and detailed explanation.

In this context, `to launch an app fully` means to have it available for all users.
