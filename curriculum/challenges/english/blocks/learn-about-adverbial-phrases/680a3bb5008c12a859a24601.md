# --explanation--

`As` means at the same time or while. For example:

- `As we learn more about the system, we'll be able to improve it.` – This means improvements will happen while learning is taking place.

- `He got more confident as he practiced more.` – This means his confidence increased while he was practicing.

Sophie is saying that they will increase the number of users at the same time when they fix any problems that come up.
