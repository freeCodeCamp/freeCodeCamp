# --explanation--

`As` at the beginning of a sentence can be used to talk about the reason why you are raising a topic. It introduces the reason why you are saying what comes next. For example:

`As we're moving into the testing phase, we need to prepare the test cases.` â€“ This means the team is starting the testing phase and that is the reason why they need to get ready.
