# --explanation--

`Content` refers to the material shared in marketing or communication - such as text, images, videos, and messages. For example:

`We posted new content on our website every week.` – This refers to regularly sharing articles, images, or videos.

In this context, it's the information or media used in the campaign.

`To fit` means to match or suit something. For example:

`This message fits our brand perfectly.` – This means the message is a good match for the company's style or identity.
