# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I think we should plan our budget based on different BLANK' costs.`

## --blanks--

`regions`

### --feedback--

This refers to specific areas of a country, the world, or a market that are grouped together by location or common features. Use the plural form.

# --explanation--

A `region` is a specific area within a country or across multiple countries, often grouped by geography, culture, or economy. For example:

- `The company expanded into the Asia-Pacific region last year.` – This means they started doing business in that large area, including countries like China, Japan, and Australia.

In the context, Riker suggests planning the budget by considering the different costs in each area.

- `Prices can vary a lot depending on the region.` – This means different locations may have different costs for the same product or service.
