# --explanation--

`First off` is used to introduce the first thing that will be discussed or done. It signals the beginning of a list or order of things to focus on. For example:

- `First off, we need to address the project's scope.` – This means addressing the project's scope is the first thing that will be done.

- `First off, let's review the current goals before we start planning.` – This means reviewing the current goals is the first thing that will happen before moving on to planning.
