<!-- (Audio) Sophie: It's possible. Our servers are good for our current load, but this new feature might make them slower. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`It's possible. Our servers are good for our current BLANK, but this new feature might make them BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`load`

### --feedback--

This refers to the amount of work or demand placed on a system, such as how much data or traffic a server handles.

---

`slower`

### --feedback--

This is the comparative form of `slow`. Here, it implies the servers' performance might become worse.

# --explanation--

`Load` refers to the amount of work or processing a system (like a server) has to handle. It could mean how many users are accessing the server, how much data is being transferred, or how many tasks the system is doing at once. For example:

`The server crashed because the load was too high during the sale.` – This means too many people were using the site at the same time.

`Slower` is the comparative form of `slow`, used to compare the speed of two things. For example:

`The older app version is slower.` – This means it takes more time to respond or load compared to the newer version (`slower than the new app version` is implicit).

Here, the comparison is implied - Sophie is saying the servers might become slower than they are now.
