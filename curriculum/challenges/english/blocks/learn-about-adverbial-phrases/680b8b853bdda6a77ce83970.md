# --explanation--

`Quite` is an adverb that adds emphasis. For example:

`The movie was quite good.` – This means it was fairly or very good, depending on tone.

`Each` means every single one in a group, taken one at a time. For example:

`Each employee has their own login.` – This means all employees have individual accounts, not one shared one.
