`back-end`

### --feedback--

This refers to the part of software or a system that handles data and operations behind the scenes, usually on a server.

# --explanation--

`How often` is used to ask about the frequency of an action or event, meaning how many times or how regularly something happens. For example:

`How often do you check your email?` – This means asking how frequently the person checks their email, such as once a day, every few hours, etc.

`Back-end development` refers to the part of software development that deals with the server side, databases, and how the application handles data and user requests behind the scenes. For example:

`The back-end development of the app involves setting up the database and writing server-side code.` – This means that back-end development includes tasks like database management and server-side coding, which are essential for making the app function properly.
