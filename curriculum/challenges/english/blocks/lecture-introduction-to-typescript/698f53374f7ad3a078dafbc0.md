# --description--

In this lesson, you will learn how to add types for objects and arrays.

Let's take a look at arrays first.

Here is an example of an array of programming languages: 

```js
const programmingLanguages = ["Java", "C++", "Python"];
```

If you wanted to explicitly type that array as an array of strings, then you can type it as `string[]`:

```ts
const programmingLanguages:string[] = ["Java", "C++", "Python"];
```

As you learned earlier, TypeScript will be smart enough to infer the type as an array of strings if you just write this:

```js
const programmingLanguages = ["Java", "C++", "Python"];
```

But explicitly typing it will help in situations if you attempt to add another type to the array like this:

```ts
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.(2322)
const programmingLanguages:string[] = ["Java", 9, "Python"];
```

Another way to type arrays is to use this syntax:

```ts
const programmingLanguages:Array<string> = ["Java", "C++", "Python"];
```

Fundamentally, these two syntaxes are the same, and the choice between the two is generally a matter of preference.

Now, let's take a look at typing objects.

Here is an example of an object literal:

```js
const developer = {
  firstName: "Jessica",
  isEmployed:true
}
```

To explicitly type the object properties, you can use this syntax:

```ts
const developer: { firstName: string, isEmployed: boolean } = {
  firstName: "Jessica",
  isEmployed:true
}
```

If you try to add or remove properties from the object, then you will get an error like this:

```ts
// Property 'isEmployed' is missing in type '{ firstName: string; }' but required in type '{ firstName: string; isEmployed: boolean; }'
const developer: { firstName: string, isEmployed: boolean } = {
  firstName: "Jessica",
}
```

You can make object properties optional by using the `?` after the property name like this:

```ts
const developer: { firstName: string, isEmployed?: boolean } = {
  firstName: "Jessica",
}
```

TypeScript will no longer display an error because the `isEmployed` property has been marked as optional.

So far, all of the object examples have had restrictive properties. That means we explicitly listed every property the object is allowed to have:

```ts
const developer: { firstName: string, isEmployed: boolean } = {
  firstName: "Jessica",
  isEmployed: true
}
```

But what if you don't know all of the property names ahead of time? What if you want an object that can have any number of properties but all of the values must follow a specific type?

Well, there are two ways to accomplish this. The first way is to use a `Record` which is a built-in generic utility type in TypeScript.

Here is the basic syntax:

```ts
Record<Keys, ValueType>
```

The first type represents the type of the keys while the second type represents the type of the values.

Here is an example of using a `Record` for a `userRoles` object:

```ts
const userRoles: Record<string, string> = {
  admin: "full-access",
  editor: "limited-access",
  viewer: "read-only"
};
```

This `userRoles` object can have any string keys, and all of the values must be strings. If you try to assign a non-string value, you’ll get an error:

```ts
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
const userRoles: Record<string, string> = {
  admin: 1
};
```

The second way to write the same idea is with an index signature:

```ts
const obj: { [key: string]: string } = {};
```

The syntax above says that any property with a string key must have a string value. Here is an example for a `settings` object:

```ts
const settings: { [key: string]: string } = {
  theme: "dark",
  language: "en",
  layout: "grid"
};
```

Just like earlier, if you have incorrect value types, TypeScript will display an error message:

```ts
// Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'
const settings: { [key: string]: string } = {
  darkMode: true
};
```

Both `Record` and index signatures are fundamentally the same. So choosing between them is mostly a matter of preference.
