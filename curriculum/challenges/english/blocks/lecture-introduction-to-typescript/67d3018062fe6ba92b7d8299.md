# --description--

In this lesson, you will learn how to work with basic primitive types and how type annotations work for variables.

For the primitive data types `string`, `null`, `undefined`, `number`, `boolean`, and `bigint`, TypeScript offers corresponding type keywords. 

**NOTE**: For this lesson, we will focus on the commonly used primitives and not go into much detail for `bigint`. The `bigint` data type is a numeric data type in JavaScript to represent numbers larger than the standard integer type. 

Let's take a look at each of these primitive types starting with `string`. Here is how you can type a string in TypeScript:

```ts
let firstName: string = "Angie";
```

Unlike vanilla JavaScript, the variable `firstName` is expecting a `string` type. So if you try to reassign it with a value of a number, then you will get an error like this:

```ts
let firstName: string = "Angie";
firstName = 9 // Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

The next type we will look at is the `number` type. Here is an example:

```ts
let age: number = 16;
```

You can assign integer and floats to the `number` type. But if you were to try and reassign a value that is a `bigint` type, then you will get an error like this:

```ts
let age: number = 16;

// Type 'bigint' is not assignable to type 'number'.
age = 123n;
```

The next type we will look at is the `boolean` type. Here are some examples:

```ts
let isLoggedIn: boolean = true;
let isAdmin: boolean = false;
```

The last two types are the `null` and `undefined` types. 

As you recall from earlier JavaScript lessons, `null` represents an intentional absence of a value. `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.

You will see examples of how to work with these types later on when you learn about function types and union types.

Now that you have seen how type annotations work with variables, the question arises on if you need to always explicitly type out your variables. 

If you have a simple type annotation like this, then you might not need to use an explicit type.

```ts
let firstName: string = "Angie";
```

Reason being is because TypeScript will try to automatically infer the types based on its value. So if you write this, TypeScript will understand it is a string.

```js
let firstName = "Angie";
```

You should explicitly type your variables when TypeScript cannot clearly infer the type or when you want to enforce a specific type for situations like function parameters or complex objects.
