# --description--

The last group of **whole syllables** is `ye`, `yue`, `yuan`, `yin`, `yun`, and `ying`.  

Also, remember they function as single, unbreakable units.

Let's practice pronouncing the whole syllables and then use `yun` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the whole syllables.
