<!-- (Audio) Chen Na: yi, wu, yu, yī, yí, yǐ, yì -->

# --description--

Another group of whole syllables is `yi`, `wu`, and `yu`. They must be read as complete units, not split into an initial and a final.

Let's practice pronouncing the whole syllables, and then use `yi` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `yī`  | `衣`|
| `yí`   | `移`|
| `yǐ`  | `以`|
| `yì`  | `意`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the whole syllables.
