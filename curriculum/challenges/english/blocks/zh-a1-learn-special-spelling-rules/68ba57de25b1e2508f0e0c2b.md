<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: yi, wu, yu, yī, yí, yǐ, yì -->

# --description--

Another group of **whole syllables** is `yi`, `wu`, and `yu`. They must be read as complete units, not split into an initial and a final.

Let's practice pronouncing the whole syllables, and then use `yi` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the whole syllables.
