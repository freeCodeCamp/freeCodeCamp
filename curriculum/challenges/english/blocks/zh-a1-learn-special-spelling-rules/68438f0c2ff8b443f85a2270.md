<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) speaker: zi, ci, si, cī, cí, cǐ, cì -->

# --description--

`zi`, `ci`, and `si` are another group of the **whole syllables**. Remember you should read these as single units rather than trying to separate them into parts. 

Let's practice pronouncing the whole syllables, and then use `ci` in different tones as an example.

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the whole syllables.
