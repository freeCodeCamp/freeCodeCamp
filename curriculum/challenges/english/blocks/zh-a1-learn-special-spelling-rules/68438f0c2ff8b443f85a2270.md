<!-- (Audio) Chen Na: zi, ci, si, zī, zí, zǐ, zì -->

# --description--

`zi`, `ci`, and `si` are another group of the whole syllables. Remember you should read these as single units rather than trying to separate them into parts. 

Let's practice pronouncing the whole syllables, and then use `ci` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `cī`  | `呲`|
| `cí`   | `词`|
| `cǐ`  | `此`|
| `cì`  | `次`|

# --assignment--

I've listened to the audio and practiced pronouncing the whole syllables.
