`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`知识 (zhī shi)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `zhī` and `shi`.

# --explanation--

The first syllable `zhī` takes the first tone, which is high and level. The second syllable is `shi` and is pronounced as a neutral tone, so it sounds lighter and shorter.

`知识 (zhī shi)` refers to information, understanding, and skills acquired through experience or education, representing what a person knows.
