<!-- (Audio) Chen Na: 知识 (zhī shi) -->

# --description--

Now, you will practice recognizing the whole syllables `zhi`, `chi`, `shi`, and `ri` in a word.

When you debug code, read docs, or learn new tools, you slowly accumulate something that helps you work better. This word is often used in that situation.

Remember to use 5 for a neutral tone.

## --sentence--

`BLANK`

## --blanks--

`知识 (zhī shi)`

### --feedback--

This word combines the syllables `zhī` and `shi`. Remember to type 5 at the end for neutral tone syllables.

# --explanation--

The first syllable `zhī` takes the first tone, which is high and level. The second syllable is `shi` and is pronounced as a neutral tone, so it sounds lighter and shorter.

`知识 (zhī shi)` refers to information, understanding, and skills acquired through experience or education, representing what a person knows.
