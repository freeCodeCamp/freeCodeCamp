<!-- (Audio) Chen Na: y, ya, ye, yi, yao, you, yang, yu, yāng, yáng, yǎng, yàng -->

# --description--

Sometimes you see `y` and `w` at the start of a syllable. They are not initials. Think of them as special spelling symbols that clarify syllable boundaries and make syllables easier to read.

The rules for `y` are:

- If `i` is used as a syllable, add `y` in front of it: `i` → `yi`.

- If a syllable starts with `i`, change it to `y`. Examples: `ia` → `ya`, `ie` → `ye`, `iao` → `yao`, `iou` → `you`, `iang` → `yang`.

- If `ü` is used as a syllable, add `y` in front of it and remove the dots: `ü` → `yu`.

Let's practice pronouncing the the syllables and then use `yang` in different tones as an example.

| Pinyin   | Character|
|--------|----------|
| `yāng`  | `央`|
| `yáng`   | `羊`|
| `yǎng`  | `养`|
| `yàng`  | `样`|

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the spelling symbol and syllables.
