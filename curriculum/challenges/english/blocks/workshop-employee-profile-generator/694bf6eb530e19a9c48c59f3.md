# --description--

Let's practice `str()` conversion one more time. Just like with age, you must convert any numeric variable to a string before concatenating it with other text.


Create a variable `experience_info`. Assign it the value of `"Experience: "` concatenated with `years_experience` (converted to a string) and `" years"`. Print the result.

# --hints--

You should create a variable `experience_info` with the value `"Experience: 5 years"`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print `experience_info`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```python
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
address = "123 Main Street"
address += ", Apartment 4B"
employee_age = 28
employee_info = full_name + " is " + str(employee_age) + " years old"
print(employee_info)

years_experience = 5
