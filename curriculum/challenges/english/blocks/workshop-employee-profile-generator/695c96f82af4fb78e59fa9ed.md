# --description--

Strings are sequences of characters used to store text data. As you might recall from previous lessons, you can create a string by enclosing text inside either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. For example:

```python
greeting = 'Hello'
print(greeting) # Output: Hello
```

Create a variable `first_name` which stores the string `John` and a variable `last_name` which stores the string `Doe`. Then print `first_name` and `last_name`.

# --hints--

You should have a variable named `first_name`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should assign the string `John` to your `first_name` variable.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should have a variable named `last_name`.

```js  
({ test: () => true })   
```

You should assign the string `Doe` to your `last_name` variable.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print your `first_name` variable to the terminal.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print your `last_name` variable to the terminal.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```
