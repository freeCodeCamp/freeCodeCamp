# --description--

You can also use negative numbers to slice from the end of a string.

* `-1` refers to the last character.
* `-2` refers to the second-to-last character, and so on.

To get the last 3 characters of a string, you can use `string[-3:]`.


Create a variable `last_three`. Use negative indexing to extract the last 3 characters from `employee_code` (which represent the ID number).
Print `last_three`.

# --hints--

You should create a variable `last_three` containing the last 3 characters `"001"`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print `last_three`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
address = "123 Main Street"
address += ", Apartment 4B"
employee_age = 28
employee_info = full_name + " is " + str(employee_age) + " years old"
print(employee_info)
years_experience = 5
experience_info = "Experience: " + str(years_experience) + " years"
print(experience_info)
position = "Data Analyst"
salary = 75000
employee_card = f"Employee: {full_name} | Age: {employee_age} | Position: {position} | Salary: ${salary}"
print(employee_card)
employee_code = "DEV-2026-JD-001"
department = employee_code[0:3]
print(department)
year_code = employee_code[4:8]
initials = employee_code[9:11]
print(year_code)
print(initials)
