# --description--

As you can see Python raised a `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`. This happens because Python does not allow you to concatenate text (strings) and numbers (integers) directly.


To fix this, you must convert the number to a string first using the `str()` function, which returns the string version of an object:

```py
my_num = str(42)
print(type(my_num)) # <class 'str'>
```

Update your `employee_info` assignment to convert `employee_age` to a string using `str(employee_age)`.

# --hints--

You should modify the assignment of your `employee_info` variable by converting `employee_age` into a string with `str(employee_age)`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```python
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)
address = '123 Main Street'
print(address)
address += ', Apartment 4B'
print(address)

employee_age = 28
--fcc-editable-region--
employee_info = full_name + ' is ' + employee_age
```
