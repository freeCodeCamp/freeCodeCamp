# --description--

You likely saw a `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str`. This happens because Python does not allow you to concatenate text (strings) and numbers (integers) directly.


To fix this, you must convert the number to a string first using the `str()` function. For example: `str(28)` becomes `'28'`.
Update your `employee_info` assignment to convert `employee_age` to a string using `str(employee_age)`.

# --hints--

You should create a variable `employee_info` with the concatenation of `full_name`, the string `' is '`, `str(employee_age)`, and the string `' years old'`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print `employee_info`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```python
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)
address = '123 Main Street'
print(address)
address += ', Apartment 4B'
print(address)
