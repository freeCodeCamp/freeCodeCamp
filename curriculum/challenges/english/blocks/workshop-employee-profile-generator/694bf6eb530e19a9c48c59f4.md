# --description--

Concatenating many strings using `+` and converting numbers using `str()` can get messy and hard to read.
Python 3.6 introduced **f-strings** to solve this. By adding the letter `f` before the opening quote, you can put variables directly inside curly braces `{}`.

Example:

```python
name = 'John'
print(f'Hello {name}') # Output: Hello John
```


Add `full_name` as `'John Doe'`, `position` as `'Data Analyst'` and `salary` as `75000'` variables.
Then, create a variable `employee_card`. Use an f-string to format it exactly like this:
`'Employee: {full_name} | Age: {employee_age} | Position: {position} | Salary: ${salary}'`

Then print `employee_card`.

# --hints--

You should create `employee_card` with the correct formatted string.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print `employee_card`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

```python
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
print(first_name)
print(last_name)
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name
print(full_name)
address = '123 Main Street'
address += ', Apartment 4B'
print(address)
employee_age = 28
employee_info = full_name + ' is ' + str(employee_age) + ' years old'
print(employee_info)
experience_info = 'Experience: ' + str(5) + ' years'
print(experience_info)
