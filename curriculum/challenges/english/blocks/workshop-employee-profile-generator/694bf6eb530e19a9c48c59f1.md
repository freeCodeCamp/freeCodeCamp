# --description--

Now, the `address = '123 Main Street'`  seems shallow, we also want to add the apartment number where the employee lives, so we should modify the variable.
When you want to add content to the end of an existing string variable, you can use the **augmented assignment** operator `+=`.
This is shorter than writing `var = var + 'new text'`.


Use `+=` to add the string `', Apartment 4B'` to the `address`.

# --hints--

You should use the `+=` operator to add `', Apartment 4B'` to the `address` variable.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should have the correct string in `address`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```python
first_name = 'John'
last_name = 'Doe'
full_name = first_name + ' ' + last_name

--fcc-editable-region--
address = '123 Main Street'

```
