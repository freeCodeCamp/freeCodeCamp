# --description--

Now let's add the final details to the card.

Create a variable named `position` with the value of the string `Data Analyst` and a variable named `salary` with the value of the integer `75000`.

Then, update your `employee_card` f-string to include the age, position, and salary. It should follow this exact format:

`Employee: {full_name} | Age: {employee_age} | Position: {position} | Salary: ${salary}`

Finally, print `employee_card` to see the result.

# --hints--

You should create a variable `position` with the value `'Data Analyst'`.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should create a variable salary with the value 75000.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should update employee_card to match the required format.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```

You should print employee_card.

```js
({ test: () => true })
```
