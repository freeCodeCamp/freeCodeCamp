# --description--

No matter which direction you're using, you need to think of your flex-containers as having 2 axes: the main axis and the cross axis. It is the direction of these axes that changes when the `flex-direction` is changed. In most circumstances, `flex-direction: row` puts the main axis horizontal (left-to-right), and `column` puts the main axis vertical (top-to-bottom).

In other words, in our very first example, you put `display: flex` on a div and it arranged its children horizontally. This is a demonstration of `flex-direction: row`, the default setting. The following example is very similar. If you uncomment the line that says `flex-direction: column`, those divs will stack vertically.
