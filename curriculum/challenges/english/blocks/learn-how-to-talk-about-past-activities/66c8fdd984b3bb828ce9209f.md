`adapting`

### --feedback--

This is the present participle of the verb `adapt`. It ends in `-ing`.

# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect Continuous` tense is used to describe actions that started in the past and are still continuing or have recently stopped, often with an emphasis on the duration of the action. 

It is formed using `have/has been` + the present participle (verb ending in `-ing`).

- `Haven't been` indicates that something has not been happening continuously up to now.

- `Adapting` is the present participle of the verb `adapt`, indicating an ongoing action.
