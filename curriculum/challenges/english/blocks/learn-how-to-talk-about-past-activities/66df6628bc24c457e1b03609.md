# --explanation--

When you ask if something was mentioned `specifically`, you want to know if it was mentioned directly, without any doubt or generalization. For example:

- `She asked specifically about the new project.` - She asked directly about the project, not in general.

- `The report specifically mentions the changes we need to make.` - The report talks directly about the changes.

In James's question, `Have any users specifically mentioned these issues in their feedback?`, he wants to know if the users have directly talked about the issues, not just mentioned them in general terms.
