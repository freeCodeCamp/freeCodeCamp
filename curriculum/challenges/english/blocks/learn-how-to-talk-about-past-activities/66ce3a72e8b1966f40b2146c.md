# --explanation--

The user specifically mentions that elements on the homepage `aren't displaying correctly` and provides details about the `navigation bar` and `footer` overlapping on smaller screens. 

The user also mentions attaching `screenshots showing the issue`, which indicates they are informing the team about a problem, not complaining, asking for features, or seeking a refund.

Focus on the part where the user explains the problem and offers evidence to help the team understand the issue.
