# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, listen to James's description of his past and current approach. 

He says `I used to just write code without thinking much about the end user` and contrasts this with `ensuring a positive user experience has become a central part of my development process.` 

This shows that the key change is his focus on user experience, which is now central to his work.
