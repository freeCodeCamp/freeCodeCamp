# --explanation--

`Deploy` means to put something into use or operation. It often refers to making software or an update available to users. For example:

`The team will deploy the new version next week.` - The new version will be made available to users next week.

When talking about something that has already been made available or put into use, use the past form `deployed`. For example:

`They deployed the update yesterday.` - The update was made available yesterday.
