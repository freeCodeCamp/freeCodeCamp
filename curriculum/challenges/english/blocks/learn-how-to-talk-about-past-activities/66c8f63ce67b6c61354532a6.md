# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect` tense is often used to ask about experiences or actions that happened at an unspecified time in the past. 

When forming questions in this tense, use `Have` or `Has` (auxiliary verb) + subject + past participle (main verb). For example:

- `Have you ever been to the HR?` - Asking if someone has visited the HR at any time in the past.
  
- `Has it finished loading the update?` - Asking if the process of loading the update was completed at some point in the past.

James is using this structure to ask if a similar issue has been resolved in the past.
