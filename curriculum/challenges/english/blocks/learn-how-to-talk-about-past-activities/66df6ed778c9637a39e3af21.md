# --explanation--

To understand why someone believes something can happen soon, look for reasons they provide in their statement.

In the sentence `We've already started working on the fixes`, `already` shows that they began working on the fixes sooner than expected.

This shows they have begun the necessary work, which supports her belief that they can roll out another update soon.
