# --explanation--

Linda talks about what the team will do during the meeting. Focus on two key phrases:

`Go over` means to review or examine something in detail. For example:

 `We need to go over the report before the presentation.` - This means they need to carefully review the report.

`Decide on` means to make a decision about something. For example:

 `We need to decide on the final design by Friday.` - This means they need to choose the final design.

In the meeting, Linda says they will `go over` the proposed solutions and `decide on` the best approach. This means they will review the solutions carefully and then make a decision about which one to choose.

Understanding these phrases helps you know that the meeting's purpose is to **review** and **choose** the best solution.
