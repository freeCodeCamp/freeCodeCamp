# --explanation--

James is asking Linda if she has had enough time to complete a specific task. The key phrase here is `have the time to`, which means to have enough time available to do something. 

To answer this question, pay attention to the part of James's sentence after he says `had time to`. This part of the sentence tells you what James is asking Linda.
