# --explanation--

Linda is saying that the development team hasn't been informed yet, but she has already taken action to address the issue. The key phrases to understand are:

- `I've` is a contraction of `I have`, used in the `Present Perfect` tense to indicate that the action (scheduling) has been completed.

- `Scheduled` is the past participle of the verb `schedule`, meaning to plan or arrange an event at a specific time.

Understanding these words will help you complete the sentence correctly.
