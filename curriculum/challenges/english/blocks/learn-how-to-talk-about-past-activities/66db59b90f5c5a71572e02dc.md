### --feedback--

### --feedback--

`Already` is not used with the present simple to talk about regular actions.

---

`I had already completed the assignment yesterday.`

# --explanation--

`Already` is used with the `Present Perfect` tense to indicate that something has happened sooner than expected or before now. For example:

- `She has already finished her work.` - The action was completed earlier than expected.

- `They have already left for the meeting.` - They left sooner than expected.
