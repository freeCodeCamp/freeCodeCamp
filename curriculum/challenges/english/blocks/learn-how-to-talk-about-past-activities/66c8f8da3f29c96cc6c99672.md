# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, pay attention to options that clearly explain whether the team has fixed a problem like this before. The best answer should show two things: 

- They haven't fixed this exact issue.

- They have fixed similar issues in other projects.

Look for an option that doesn't contradict itself and provides a clear explanation, showing their experience with similar problems.
