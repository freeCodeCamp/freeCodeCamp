# --explanation--

`It's been` is a contraction of `It has been` which describes something that started in the past and continues up to now. 

`Over a year` tells you the amount of time that has passed. `Over` means more than, so `over a year` means that the collaboration has lasted more than one year, not just a few months or exactly one year.
