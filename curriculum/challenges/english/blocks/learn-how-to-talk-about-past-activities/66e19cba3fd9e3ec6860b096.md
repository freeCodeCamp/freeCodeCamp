## --text--

This is an email from a user that's reporting some issues:

`Hi there!`

`I'm frustrated with some problems I've been having with the app recently. Every time I try to enter values for a different month, the app shows the right month at the top, but the numbers stay the same as the month before. For example, when I select March, it still shows the numbers from February. This is really confusing.`

# --explanation--

To identify the main problem, look for sentences that describe the issue the user is experiencing. 

Pay attention to phrases like `Every time I try` and `the app shows` which tell us what happens when the user tries to use the app. 

The phrase `numbers stay the same as the month before` also helps explain what is not working correctly.
