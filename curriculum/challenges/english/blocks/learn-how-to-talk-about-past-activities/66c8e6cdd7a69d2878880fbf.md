<!-- (Audio)James: Have you seen the latest user feedback?  -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Have you BLANK the latest user feedback?`

## --blanks--

`seen`

### --feedback--

The past participle of `see` is irregular, and it is not `see` or `saw`.

# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect` tense is used to talk about actions or experiences that happened at some point before now.

Use this structure to talk about something that happened before now, but **where the exact time isn't important**.

To form the `Present Perfect` tense, use `have` or `has` followed by the past participle of the verb.

The past participle of the verb `see` is `seen`. It's irregular, which means it doesn't just add `-ed` like regular verbs. For example:

- `I have seen the report.` - At some point before now, you saw the report.

- `She has seen the report.` - At some point before now, she saw the report.
