## --video-solution--

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, focus on the key elements of Bob's question: `review the user feedback` and `since we deployed the update`. 

Bob wants to know if Linda has looked at the user feedback after the update was deployed. 

The question doesn't mention anything about the timing of the update, future updates, or direct communication with users. 

Look for the option that aligns directly with reviewing feedback and ignores unrelated topics like the timing or future plans.
