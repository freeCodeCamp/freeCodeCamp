`Past Participle` of an irregular verb that means to experience or cause an effect.

# --explanation--

`We've` is a contraction of `we have`.

`Made` is the past participle of the irregular verb `make`. `Have made` describes something created or completed in the past with effects on the present.

In this sentence, `have had` is in the present perfect tense. This structure `have` + `had` shows that something started in the past and still affects the present. 

- `Have` is an auxiliary verb used in the present perfect tense.

- `Had` is the past participle of `have`, meaning to experience or possess.

Together, `have had` means that the changes began earlier and continue to make an impact now.

In summary, these irregular verbs (`make` as `made` and `have` as `had`) form the present perfect tense, indicating actions that started in the past and are still relevant now.
