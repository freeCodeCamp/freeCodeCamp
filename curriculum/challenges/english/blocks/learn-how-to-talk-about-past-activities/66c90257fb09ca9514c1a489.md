<!-- SPEAKING-->

# --instructions--

# --questions--

## --text--

Linda has received a few detailed reports from users. What should she say?

## --answers--

`Yes, a few, actually.`

---

`Yes, we will receive the reports soon.`

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

In this case, Linda needs to confirm if she has already received the reports. Consider the difference between these two responses:

- `Yes, a few, actually.` - This answer confirms that Linda has **already** received some reports. 

- `Yes, we will receive the reports soon.` - This answer suggests that the reports **have not yet** been received but are expected in the future. It doesn't confirm that any reports have already been received.
