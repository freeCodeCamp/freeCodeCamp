# --explanation--

`Roll out` means to introduce or launch something new, like a product, service, or update, to the public or users. For example:

`The company will roll out the new software next week.` - They will release the new software next week.

If Linda is thinking about an update next month, she might use `roll out` to talk about releasing it.
