# --explanation--

To understand what someone wants to know, focus on the question they ask. 

Bob asks, `What do we have to deal with now?` The phrase `have to deal with` means something that requires attention or action. The word `now` shows that Bob is asking about what needs to be done at this moment.

So, Bob wants to know what tasks or problems they need to handle immediately.
