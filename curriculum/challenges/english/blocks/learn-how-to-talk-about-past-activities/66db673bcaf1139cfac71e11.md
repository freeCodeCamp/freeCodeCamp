# --explanation--

To understand the status of something, look for words or phrases that indicate if the action is complete or not. 

`Yet` in a negative sentence means that the action has not been done up to now, but it is expected to happen in the future.

In the sentence, `We haven't addressed all the minor elements yet`, `yet` shows that addressing the minor elements is something expected to happen in the future, but it hasn't been done up to now.
