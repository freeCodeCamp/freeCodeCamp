# --explanation--

To find the answer, listen to Linda's sentence carefully. She says, `the changes we've made in just this last year have had a great impact`. Here's how to identify the correct answer:

- Linda mentions `changes`, meaning something new or different they implemented during the last year.

- `In just this last year` tells you that Linda is talking about something specific that happened within the past year.

- `Have had a great impact` explains the result of those changes made a strong, positive effect.
