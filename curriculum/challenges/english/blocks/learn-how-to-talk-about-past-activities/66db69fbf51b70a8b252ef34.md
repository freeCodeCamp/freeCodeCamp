- `We've` is a contraction for `We have`, used in the `Present Perfect` tense to show that progress has happened.

- `Made` is the past participle of `make`, used here to talk about progress that has been achieved.

- `Aren't` is a contraction for `are not`, which is part of the present continuous tense.

- `Responding` is showing that the action (icons and buttons not working correctly) is happening now.
