In the `Present Perfect`, `yet` is used in negative sentences or questions to talk about something that hasn't happened up to now but is expected to happen in the future. For example:

- `I haven't finished my work yet.` - The work is not finished, but it is expected to be completed.

- `Has she called you yet?` - This is asking if the call has happened up to now.
