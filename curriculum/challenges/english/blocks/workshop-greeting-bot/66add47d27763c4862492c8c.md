# --description--

For the final step, you will log the bot's message of `"Well, it was nice to talk to you. Have a nice day!"` to the console.

And with that, your greeting bot is complete!

# --hints--

You should have a `console` statement in your code.

```js
assert.lengthOf(__helpers.removeJSComments(code).match(/console\.log(.*)/g), 9);
```

Your `console` statement should log the string `"Well, it was nice to talk to you. Have a nice day!"`.

```js
assert.match(__helpers.removeJSComments(code), /console\.log\s*\(\s*["']Well\s*,\s*it\s*was\s*nice\s*to\s*talk\s*to\s*you\s*\.\s*Have\s*a\s*nice\s*day\s*!["']\s*\)\s*/
);
```
