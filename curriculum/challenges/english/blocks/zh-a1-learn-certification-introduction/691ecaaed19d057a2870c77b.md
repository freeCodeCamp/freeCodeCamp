Chinese is spoken in many regional varieties. In this curriculum, you will learn **Mandarin**, the most widely used standard form of spoken Chinese.

Chinese is written in two major forms: Simplified and Traditional Chinese. This curriculum will focus on **Simplified Chinese**.

Since Chinese characters are not phonetic, a system called **Pinyin**​ is used to represent their sounds. Pinyin is a romanization system that uses the Latin alphabet to indicate how Chinese characters are pronounced. It serves as an essential tool for beginners to learn the pronunciation of the language and to type Chinese on digital devices.

To input Chinese, you type the Pinyin, and a bar of candidate characters will appear. From there, you can slide or tap to choose the one you want.

If you are using your computer for the Chinese curriculum, you'll need to make sure it's ready to type Pinyin.

## Setting Up on Windows 10 or 11  

1. Open **Settings** from the Start menu.

2. Go to **Time & Language**, then click **Language**.

3. Under **Preferred languages**, choose **Add a language**.

4. Search for **Chinese** and pick **Chinese (Simplified)**.

5. Click **Next** and then **Install**.


Once the language is installed:  

- Find it in your **Preferred languages** list.

- Click on it and select **Options**.

- Under **Keyboards**, make sure **Microsoft Pinyin** is installed.


To switch between keyboards:  

- Press **Windows key + Spacebar**.

- Or click the language icon on your taskbar (often marked as **ENG**) and pick Chinese.


## Setting Up on Mac  

1. Open the **Apple Menu** and select **System Preferences**.

2. Go to **Keyboard**.

3. Click the **Input Sources** tab.

4. Select the **plus (+)** button, click **Chinese, Simplified** and pick **Pinyin - Simplified** from the list.  


To switch between keyboards:

- Press **Control + Spacebar**.

- Or click the input icon on the menu bar and select the Pinyin method.

Now you are all set to go through the Chinese curriculum and complete the tasks.
