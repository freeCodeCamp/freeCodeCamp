Chinese has many spoken varieties. In this curriculum, you will learn **Mandarin**, the widely used standard form of spoken Chinese.

Unlike alphabetic languages, Chinese characters do not indicate their pronunciation. To help learners read and speak Mandarin, there is a system called **Pinyin**, a romanization system that uses the Latin alphabet to represent how Chinese characters are pronounced.

Pinyin is also the system used to type Chinese. You enter Pinyin on your keyboard, and it's converted into Chinese characters.

If you are using your computer for the Chinese curriculum, you'll need to make sure it's ready to type Pinyin.

## Setting Up on Windows 10 or 11  

1. Open **Settings** from the Start menu.

2. Go to **Time & Language**, then click **Language**.

3. Under **Preferred languages**, choose **Add a language**.

4. Search for **Chinese** and pick Chinese (Simplified).

5. Click **Next** and then **Install**.


Once the language is installed:  

- Find it in your **Preferred languages** list.

- Click on it and select **Options**.

- Under **Keyboards**, make sure **Microsoft Pinyin** is installed.
 

To switch between keyboards:  

- Press **Windows key + Spacebar**.

- Or click the language icon on your taskbar (often marked as **ENG**) and pick Chinese.


## Setting Up on Mac  

1. Open the **Apple Menu** and select **System Preferences**.

2. Go to **Keyboard**.

3. Click the **Input Sources** tab.

4. Select the **plus (+)** button, click **Chinese, Simplified** and pick **Pinyin - Simplified** from the list.  


To switch input methods:

- Press **Control + Spacebar**.

- Or click the input icon on the menu bar and select the Pinyin method.

Now you are all set to go through the Chinese curriculum and complete the tasks.
