With freeCodeCamp's custom inputs, you can type Pinyin and Chinese characters directly in the tasks.

If you use a Chinese keyboard on your computer, you'll be able to type in the Pinyin and select the Chinese characters from the suggestions. Here is how to set it up.

## Setting Up on Windows 10 or 11  

1. Open **Settings** from the Start menu.

2. Go to **Time & Language**, then click **Language**.

3. Under **Preferred languages**, choose **Add a language**.

4. Search for **Chinese** and pick **Chinese (Simplified)**.

5. Click **Next** and then **Install**.

Once the language is installed:  

- Find it in your **Preferred languages** list.

- Click on it and select **Options**.

- Under **Keyboards**, make sure **Microsoft Pinyin** is installed.

To switch between keyboards:  

- Press **Windows key + Spacebar**.

- Or click the language icon on your taskbar (often marked as **ENG**) and pick Chinese.

## Setting Up on Mac  

1. Open the **Apple Menu** and select **System Preferences**.

2. Go to **Keyboard**.

3. Click the **Input Sources** tab.

4. Select the **plus (+)** button, click **Chinese, Simplified** and pick **Pinyin - Simplified** from the list.  

To switch between keyboards:

- Press **Control + Spacebar**.

- Or click the input icon on the menu bar and select the Pinyin method.

Now you are all set.
