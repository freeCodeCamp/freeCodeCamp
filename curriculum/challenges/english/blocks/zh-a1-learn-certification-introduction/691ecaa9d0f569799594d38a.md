If you are using your mobile device to navigate through the Chinese curriculum, you can type Pinyin and Chinese characters directly using freeCodeCamp's custom inputs. However, if you'd like to use the Chinese keyboard on your device, here's how to set it up.

## Adding Language Keyboards  

### On Android

**NOTE:** The Android path is not universal and may vary depending on the device.

1. Open Settings.

2. Go to System (or General Management, depending on the device).

3. Tap Keyboard settings (or Languages & input).  

4. Tap Languages and types (or Add keyboard). 
 
5. Turn on Chinese (Simplified or CN) or download it if needed.  

6. Save or tap Done, if prompted.

### On iPhone

1. Open Settings.

2. Go to General > Keyboard.

3. Tap Keyboards.

4. Tap Add New Keyboard.  

5. Select Chinese (simplified).  

6. Use the globe icon on the keyboard to switch languages.

## Trying Third-Party Keyboards  

You can also install third-party keyboard apps​ on your phone or tablet to make typing in Chinese easier. These keyboards​ often come with useful features like smart character predictions and support for multiple input methods, such as Pinyin or handwriting.

Now you are all set.
