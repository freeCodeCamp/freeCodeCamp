If you are using your mobile device to navigate through the Chinese curriculum, you can type Pinyin and Chinese characters directly using freeCodeCamp's custom inputs. However, if you'd like to use the Chinese keyboard on your device, here's how to set it up.

## On Android  

1. Open **Settings**.

2. Go to **System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard**.

3. Choose your keyboard app, like Gboard.

4. Tap **Languages**.

5. Add **Chinese (Simplified)**.

6. Tap **Done** to finish.  

*Note:* Menu names may vary slightly on different Android devices.

## On iPhone  

1. Open **Settings**.

2. Go to **General > Keyboard**.

3. Tap **Keyboards**, then **Add New Keyboard**.

4. Select **Chinese (Simplified) – Pinyin**.

5. Use the globe icon on your keyboard to switch between language layouts.

## Trying Third-Party Keyboards  

You can also install third-party keyboard apps​ on your phone or tablet to make typing in Chinese easier. These keyboards​ often come with useful features like smart character predictions and support for multiple input methods, such as Pinyin or handwriting.

Now you are all set.
