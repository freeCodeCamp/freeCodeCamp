# --description--

To make your learning experience easier, freeCodeCamp created the Pinyin–Hanzi Input. With it, you simply type the correct Pinyin letters plus a tone number, and the system automatically turns your input into the correct Chinese character.

For example, typing `ni3 hao3`, with or without a space between the two syllables, produces the two-character word `你好 (nǐ hǎo)`. Both characters have the third tone, indicated by the number `3` after each syllable.

At this stage, don't worry if you don't understand how Pinyin or tones work. You'll learn those later.

Keep in mind that as you progress, you'll eventually feel comfortable using the standard Chinese input methods introduced earlier. The Pinyin–Hanzi Input is here to help you get started smoothly, but building real familiarity with the regular input methods will be important for your long-term learning.

In the next lesson, you'll get a closer, hands-on experience using the Pinyin–Hanzi Input.
