# --explanation--

`Glad` is a synonym for `happy`. If you say `I'm glad to hear that`, it means you like what you hear. For example: 

`I'm glad to hear you are moving to our neighborhood.` - This means you are happy that the person is coming to live close to you. 

By saying `I'm glad to hear that`, Jessica is expressing she's happy with Bob's praise to her QA work.
