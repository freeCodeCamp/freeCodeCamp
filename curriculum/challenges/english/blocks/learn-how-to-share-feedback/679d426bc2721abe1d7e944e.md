# --explanation--

`Will` is used to respond to a request by expressing willingness or intent to do something. For example:

- Person 1: `Can you send me the report?`

- Person 2: `Sure, I'll send it right away.` - Here, `I'll send it` shows that the speaker is agreeing to the request.

In this dialogue, James uses `I'll check it out` to confirm that he will investigate the issue.
