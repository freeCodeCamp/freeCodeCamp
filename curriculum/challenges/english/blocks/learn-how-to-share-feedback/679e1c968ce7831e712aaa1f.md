# --explanation--

The `Present Perfect` tense in `you've done a great job` is used because Jessica's work started in the past and still has relevance in the present. This tense connects past actions to their current effects. Another example:

`She has improved the software significantly.` - This means her improvements started in the past and still matter now.
