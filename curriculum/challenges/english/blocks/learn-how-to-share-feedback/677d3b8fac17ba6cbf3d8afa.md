# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I want to start by BLANK that you've done a great job with your BLANK work.`

## --blanks--

`saying`

### --feedback--

This is the `-ing` form of the verb `say`, used after the preposition `by` to indicate the method of starting.

---

`QA`

### --feedback--

This stands for `Quality Assurance`, referring to the process of ensuring products meet required standards.

# --explanation--

When a verb follows a preposition, it must take the `-ing` form (gerund). In this sentence, `saying` follows the preposition `by`, indicating the method Bob uses to start his statement. For example:

`She improved her skills by practicing regularly.` - Here, `practicing` follows the preposition `by`, showing how she improved her skills.

Bob compliments Jessica for her work in `QA`. `QA` stands for `Quality Assurance`. It refers to the process of ensuring that products or services meet specific quality standards and function correctly. Another example:

`The QA team identified several bugs during testing.` - This means that the people responsible for making sure the quality of the software is good managed to detect bugs in the software before its release.
