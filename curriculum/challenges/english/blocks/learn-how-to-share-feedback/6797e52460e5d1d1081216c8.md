# --explanation--

The `-ing` form of a verb is used after prepositions, such as `on`, as in the phrase `work on improving`. This structure emphasizes the ongoing action related to the preposition. For example:

`She is working on finishing her presentation before the meeting.` - This means she is actively making progress on completing her presentation.

The infinitive form of a verb is often used after certain verbs, like `continue`. In this case, `continue to focus` is the structure of choice due to the combination with the verb `continue`. For example:

`He plans to continue to learn new skills for his career.` - This means he intends to keep learning as part of his career development.

The verb form to be used will depend pretty much on what precedes it.
