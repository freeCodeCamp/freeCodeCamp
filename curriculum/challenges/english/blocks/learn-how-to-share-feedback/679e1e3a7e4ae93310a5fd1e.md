# --instructions--

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`You've caught BLANK issues, which has really BLANK the team.`

## --blanks--

`several`

### --feedback--

This word means more than a few but not necessarily a large number.

---

`helped`

### --feedback--

The `Present Perfect` tense of the verb `help` is used here, showing that the positive effect continues into the present.

# --explanation--

`Several` means more than a few but not necessarily a large number. It indicates an unspecified amount that is more than two. For example:

`We've received several requests for a new feature.` - This means there were multiple requests, but not a specific large number.

The `Present Perfect` tense in `which has really helped the team` is used because the positive impact of catching the issues started in the past and still affects the team now. For example:

`Her comments in the software have made it easier for new employees to understand the code.` - This means her comments are still beneficial today.
