# --explanation--

`So` is used to show intent or purpose when performing an action. The word `that` is optional after `so` in this structure. For example:

`I sent an email so (that) everyone is aware of the deadline.` - This means the purpose of sending the email was to inform everyone about the deadline.

In this dialogue, `so they know we're working on it` explains why Maria wants to keep the client informed.
