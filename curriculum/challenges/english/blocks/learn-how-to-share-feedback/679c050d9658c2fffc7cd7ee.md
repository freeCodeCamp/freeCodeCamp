# --explanation--

`To get an email` means to receive an email message. For example:

`I got an email from my manager about the new project.` - This means the manager sent an email that the person received.

`Just` before `got` means that the action happened very recently. For example:

`I just got a new laptop.` - This means the speaker recently bought a new laptop.
