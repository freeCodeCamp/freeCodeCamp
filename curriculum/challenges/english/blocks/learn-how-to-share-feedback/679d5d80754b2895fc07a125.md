# --explanation--

`The full scope of an issue` refers to understanding all aspects of a problem, including its causes and effects, before taking action. For example:

`Before fixing the bug, we need to assess the full scope of its impact on other features.` - This means analyzing how the bug affects different parts of the system.

`Let's make sure` is used to emphasize confirming or verifying something before proceeding. For example:

`Let's make sure we have all the requirements before starting development.` - This means they should verify that everything is ready before beginning the process of developing.
