# --explanation--

The phrase `I've noticed that` is used to introduce an observation. The Present Perfect tense is used here because, even though Bob's observation happened in the past, it is still relevant in the present, as this is something she could improve and it affects Jessica's current review. For example:

`I've noticed that the reports contain a few errors.` - This means the speaker has observed errors over time - the issue still exists.
