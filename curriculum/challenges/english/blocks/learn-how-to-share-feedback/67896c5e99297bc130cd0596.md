# --explanation--

The structure `to be` + adjective + `to` + verb in the infinitive form is used to describe someone's reaction, feeling, or state regarding an action. For example:

- `She was surprised to receive such a thoughtful gift.` - Here, `surprised` is the adjective, and `to receive` is the infinitive form of the verb.

- `He was excited to join the new project.` - In this sentence, `excited` expresses his eagerness, and `to join` is the action he is eager about.

By saying what she said, Jessica is expressing her feelings in relation to what Bob said about her QA work.
