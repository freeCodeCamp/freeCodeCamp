# --explanation--

`To make progress` means to move forward or achieve improvement in a task or goal. For example:

`The team made significant progress on the project last week.` - This means the team achieved improvements or completed important parts of the project.

`Everyone` is a singular pronoun that refers to all people in a group. The verb that follows it is in the third-person singular form, like `has` in this dialogue. For example:

`Everyone knows the importance of teamwork.` - The singular verb `knows` matches the singular pronoun `everyone`.

The sentence contains a mixed conditional structure where the `if` clause uses the first conditional (`If everyone has a different opinion`) and the consequence uses `could` to express a future possibility (`it could be difficult to make progress`). This is acceptable, as `could` softens the statement. For example:

`If the weather improves, we could go to the park later.` - This expresses a possible future action if the condition (weather improving) is met.
