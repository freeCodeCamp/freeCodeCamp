# --explanation--

The structure `if + verb in the Simple Past` followed by `might` in the consequence clause is used to describe a hypothetical situation with a possible outcome. For example:

`If you studied more, you might pass the exam.` - This means there is a possibility of passing if the person studies more.

In this dialogue, `If we all agreed on everything, we might miss important details` expresses a possible negative consequence of complete agreement.
