# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Which features did he BLANK? Do you think it's a BLANK issue?`

## --blanks--

`mention`

### --feedback--

In past simple questions, the main verb does not take a past ending because the auxiliary verb "did" already marks the past.

---

`coding`

### --feedback--

This word describes something related to programming or writing software.

# --explanation--

In `Past Simple` questions, the main verb remains in its base form because the auxiliary verb `did` already carries the past tense. For example:

`What time did you arrive?` (Not `did you arrived`)  

`Coding` as an adjective refers to things related to writing software. A `coding issue` means a problem with the code that affects the functionality of a program. For example:

`The development team is working on fixing a coding issue that caused system crashes.` - This means a problem in the code was affecting the system.
