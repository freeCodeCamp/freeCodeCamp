<!-- (Audio) Maria: If we keep them in the loop, it might help ease their frustration, right? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

What expression similar to `absolutely` could James use to say he totally agrees with Maria?

## --answers--

`Exactly.`

---

`By no means.`

### --feedback--

This would mean the opposite of `Absolutely`.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Exactly` works almost the same way as `absolutely` in the sense of indicating that you fully agree with the other person. For example:

- Person 1: `Focusing on understanding the problem first will prevent frustration later.`

- Person 2: `Exactly.` - This means you agree with the other speaker's comment.
