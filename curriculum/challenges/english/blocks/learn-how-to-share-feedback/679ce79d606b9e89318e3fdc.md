<!-- (Audio) Maria: Did you hear anything about this? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

How could James tell Maria he has no information and ask about the content of the email?

## --answers--

`No, I didn't. What did he say?`

---

`Don't worry. The project has no issues.`

### --feedback--

We heard from Maria the client is complaining about an issue, so that's not the case.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Since Maria asks her question starting with `Did you hear...`, a short answer to that normally uses `did` as well. For example:

- Person 1: `Did you hear anything about the new policy changes?`

- Person 2: `Yes, I did.` - The answer implies you received some news regarding the policy changes.
