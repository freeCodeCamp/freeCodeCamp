# --explanation--

When a verb follows a preposition (such as `without`), it takes the `-ing` form. In this case, `without causing` means avoiding an action that leads to disruption. This is true for all prepositions. For example:

- `She left without saying goodbye.` - This means that she did not say goodbye prior to leaving.

- `We succeeded by working together.` - The preposition `by` implies the manner through which they succeeded - working as a team.

- `They talked about improving the process.` - The preposition `about` comes before the topic of the conversation - how to improve the process.
