# --explanation--

`What do you think about` is used to ask for someone's opinion or thoughts on a specific topic. It is a common and polite way to encourage someone to share their perspective. For example:

`What do you think about the new project proposal?` - This means the speaker wants to know the other person's opinion of the proposal.

In this context, Brian is trying to make up his mind about the recent team meeting and asks Lisa to share what she thought of it so they could discuss it.
