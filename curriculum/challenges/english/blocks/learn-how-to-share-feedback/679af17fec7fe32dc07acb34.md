# --questions--

## --answers--

`I guess you're right.`

---

`None of this makes sense to me.`

### --feedback--

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Using `I guess`, you are telling other people you believe something is true, although you're not 100% sure of it.

If you say `I guess you're right`, you agree with the other person, but you're also implying you're not so certain of it. For example:

- Person 1: `You should try eating less sweets. This will help you stay healthy.`

- Person 2: `I guess you're right.` - This means that you think what the speaker is saying makes sense, though you're not totally convinced of it.
