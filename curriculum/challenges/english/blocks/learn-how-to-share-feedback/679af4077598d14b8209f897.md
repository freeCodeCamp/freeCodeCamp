# --explanation--

`Enough` means having a sufficient amount of something. For example:

`We don't have enough resources to complete the project.` - This means the available resources are insufficient.

`Actual` means real or essential, as opposed to just discussing or planning. For example:

`The meeting took longer than expected, so we had little time for the actual work.` - This means the real tasks were delayed due to discussions.

`To get something done` means to complete a task or finish something that needs to be accomplished. For example:

`We need to get this report done by Friday.` - This means the report must be completed before the deadline.
