### --feedback--

This word is used in questions to refer to any information, without specifying what it is.

# --explanation--

`Anything` is commonly used in questions to ask if there is any information, object, or detail related to the topic. It does not specify a particular thing. For example:

`Did she say anything about the deadline?` - This asks if she provided any information about the deadline.  

`Anything` is also used in negative sentences. For example:

`I didn't hear anything about the meeting.` - The speaker has no information about the meeting.

However, in affirmative sentences, `something` is usually used instead of `anything`. For example:

`I heard something interesting about the meeting.` - The speaker has been told an interesting information.
