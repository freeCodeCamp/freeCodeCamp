# --explanation--

The structure `if` + `Present Simple` tense, `will` + base verb is used to describe a conditional sentence where a specific action leads to a likely result. For example:

`If you practice every day, you will get better at coding.` - Practicing daily results in improvement.

`To follow someone's work` means to understand or keep track of someone's progress, actions, or output. For example:

`The new intern is following your work closely to learn from you.` - This means the intern is observing and understanding what you do to gain knowledge.
