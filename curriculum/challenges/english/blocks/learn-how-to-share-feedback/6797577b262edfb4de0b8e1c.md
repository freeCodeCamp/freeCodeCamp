# --explanation--

The structure `how + comparative adjective` is used to emphasize or evaluate the degree or extent of something in comparison to another thing. For example:  

- `I see how better documentation could help the team.` - This shows Jessica understands the benefits of improved documentation.

- `He realized how faster responses could improve customer satisfaction.` - This emphasizes the impact of quicker responses.

The verb `focus` means to give attention or effort to something specific. For example:

`She is focusing on learning new skills for her career.` - This means she is directing her attention toward improving her skills.
