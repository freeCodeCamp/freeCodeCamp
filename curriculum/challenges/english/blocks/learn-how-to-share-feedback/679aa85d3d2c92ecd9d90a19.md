## --answers--

`I understand.`

---

`No, I disagree with you.`

### --feedback--

# --explanation--

`Don't you think?` can be used to ask for someone's opinion after sharing with them your thoughts.

To say that what you told them makes sense, they could answer `I understand`, which does not necessarily express agreement, but conveys the idea that they think what you told them is logical. For example:

- Person 1: `Studying is better than not doing anything, don't you think?`

- Person 2: `I understand, but...` - This means the person acknowledges the logic behind what you said. Using `but` right after indicates they might say something to contrast with this initial idea.
