# --explanation--

The `search function` is a tool that allows users to find specific content within an application or website. For example:

`The app's search function helps users quickly find their saved documents.` - This means users can look for specific files using the search feature.

In a user interface (UI), `buttons` are interactive elements that users click to perform actions. For example:

`The submit button on the form allows users to send their responses.` - This means clicking the button completes the action of submitting the form.
