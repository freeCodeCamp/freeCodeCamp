# --explanation--

`Let's hope` is used to express a shared desire or wish for a positive outcome. It encourages optimism or patience. For example:

`Let's hope the weather stays nice for the trip.` - This means you wish to have good weather during the trip and suggest that the listener does the same.

In this dialogue, James is suggesting that he and Maria both hope for an easy solution.
