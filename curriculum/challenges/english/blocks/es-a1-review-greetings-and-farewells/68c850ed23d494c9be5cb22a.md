# --description--

Congratulations! You're almost done with this module!

The article below will help you review some key grammar points covered in the tasks, so you can feel confident before taking the Module Quiz.

Once you've read it, just mark the task as complete and move on to the next part of the review.

## Grammar Highlights

### Subject Pronoun Omission

In Spanish, it's common to omit the subject pronoun (like `yo`) because the verb form already tells who the subject is. For example:

- `Soy Camila.` – I am Camila.  

- `Me llamo Esteban.` – My name is Esteban.

<br />

### Using `soy` to Talk About Identity

The verb `ser` (to be) is used to describe who you are; like your name or profession.

`Soy` means "I am". It's often followed directly by a noun and no article is needed. For example:

- `Soy diseñadora.` – I am a designer.  

- `Soy analista.` – I am an analyst.

### No Articles Before Professions

In English, people say "a developer", but in Spanish, you **don't use** an article (`un` or `una`) before a profession.

You can use `Soy analista`.

### Greeting with Time of Day

Spanish greetings change depending on the time of day. They are treated as **set phrases**. For example:

- `Hola, buenos días.` – Hello, good morning.  

- `Hola, buenas tardes.` – Hello, good afternoon.  

- `Hola, buenas noches.` – Hello, good evening.

- `Adiós, buenas noches.` – Goodbye, good night.


### Combined Farewells

In Spanish, it's polite and common to use **multiple farewell phrases together**, such as:

- `Hasta luego. Adiós.` – See you later. Goodbye. 

- `Hasta mañana. Chao.` – See you tomorrow. Bye.

### Accents and Pronunciation

Accents in Spanish show where to put the stress and sometimes change the meaning of a word. Examples from this lesson:

- `Días` – days (stress on the `í`).

- `Adiós` – goodbye (stress on the `ó`).

### Special Letters in Spanish

`ll` in the word `llamo`. For example:

`Me llamo...` – my name is...

`Ñ` is a separate letter in the Spanish alphabet. For example: 

`Mañana` – tomorrow
