# --explanation--

This exercise helps you to practice how to write and identify numbers in Spanish.

The number **20** is called `veinte`.

Numbers from **21** to **29** are written as one word, starting with `veinti-`. For example:

- `Veintiuno` - Twenty-one.

- `Veintidós` - Twenty-two.

- `Veintitrés` - Twenty-three.

The number **30** is called `treinta`.

Numbers from **31** to **39** are written with `treinta y` + number. For example:

- `Treinta y uno` - Thirty-one.

- `Treinta y cuatro` - Thirty-four.

- `Treinta y nueve` - Thirty-nine.
