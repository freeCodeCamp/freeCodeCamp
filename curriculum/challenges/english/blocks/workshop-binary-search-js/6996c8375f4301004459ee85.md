# --description--

Now that you've calculated the `mid` index, you need to actually retrieve the value from the `searchList` at that index. This value is what you will compare against your `value` parameter, which is the target you are searching for.

Create a `valueAtMiddle` variable and assign it the element from `searchList` that is located at the `mid` index.

# --hints--

You should create a `valueAtMiddle` variable set to `searchList[mid]`.

```js

```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function binarySearch(searchList, value) {
  let pathToTarget = [];
  let low = 0;
  let high = searchList.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
      let mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
