# --description--

In a previous lesson, you learned about binary search and how it differs from linear search.

In this workshop, you will put that into practice by building a binary search algorithm.

To begin, create a `binarySearch` function with a `searchList` and `value` parameters.

`searchList` is the array of elements the function will search within, and `value` is the target the function will try to find within the `searchList`.

# --hints--

You should create a `binarySearch` function.

```js
```

Your `binarySearch` function should have a `searchList` and `value` parameters.

```js
```
