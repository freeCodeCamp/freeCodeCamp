# --description--

To get started with the loop, you need to find the middle index of the current search space.

You can get the middle index by calculating the average of the `low` and `high` variables. You will have to use floor division to get the average after adding the two values, so the answer would always be an integer rounded down, as the indices must be integers.

Within your `while` loop and create a `mid` variable set to the average of `low` and `high`.

# --hints--

Within the while loop you should create a `mid` variable set to `Math.floor((low + high) / 2)`.

```js
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function binarySearch(searchList, value) {
  let pathToTarget = [];
  let low = 0;
  let high = searchList.length - 1;
    while (low <= high) {
