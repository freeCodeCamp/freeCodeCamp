# --description--

This workshop introduces Python numbers and basic math operators through a simple "split the bill" scenario. Learners will work with integers, floats, and common operators to calculate how much each person will pay.

Create a variable called `running_total` and set it to `0`. This variable will be used to keep track of the total bill as costs are added.

# --hints--
You should have a variable named `running_total`.

```js
//test wil be added later
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```python
--fcc-editable-region--
# Declare your variable below:
--fcc-editable-region--
```
