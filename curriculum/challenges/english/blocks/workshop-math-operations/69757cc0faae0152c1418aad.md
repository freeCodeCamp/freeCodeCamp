# --description--

In this workshop, you will apply your knowledge of Python numbers and basic mathematical operations to build a bill splitter. This tool will calculate how much each person owes after adding meal costs and a tip.

To start, you need a way to keep track of the total amount as costs are added. In Python, you can use a variable to store a number that changes over time.

Create a variable named `running_total` and assign it the value `0`.

# --hints--

You should have a variable named `running_total`.

```js
//test wil be added later
```

You should assign the integer `0` to your `running_total` variable.

```js
//test will be added later
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```python
--fcc-editable-region--

--fcc-editable-region--
```
