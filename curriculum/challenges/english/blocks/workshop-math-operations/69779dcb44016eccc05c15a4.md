# --description--

The service was excellent, so the group decides to leave a 25% tip. To calculate a percentage in Python, you can multiply the total by the decimal equivalent of the percentage.

For example, to find 10% of a value, you would multiply it by `0.10`:

```py
tax = total * 0.10
```

Create a variable named `tip` and assign it the result of multiplying `running_total` by `0.25`.

Finally, use `print()` to display the string `'Tip amount:'` followed by the value of your `tip` variable.

# --hints--

You should have a variable named `tip`.

```js
// test will go here
```

Your `tip` variable should be the result of `running_total * 0.25`.

```js
// test will go here
```

You should print the string `'Tip amount:'` followed by the `tip` variable.

```js
//test will go here
```

# --seed--

```py
running_total = 0

num_of_friends = 4

benjis_bill = 37.89
mortys_bill = 57.34
marcys_bill = 39.39
my_bill = 64.21

running_total = benjis_bill + mortys_bill + marcys_bill + my_bill
print('Total bill so far:', running_total)
