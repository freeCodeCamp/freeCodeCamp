# --description--

With the tip now included, you have the final amount for the entire group. The last step is to determine how much each person owes by dividing the total bill by the number of friends. 

In Python, you use the forward slash `/` to perform division. For example:

```py
half = 10 / 2
```

Create a variable named `each_pays` and assign it the result of dividing `running_total` by `num_of_friends`. 

Finally, use the `print()` function to display the value of `each_pays`.

# --hints--

You should define a variable named `each_pays`.

```js
//test will go here
```

You should use the `/` operator to divide `running_total` by `num_of_friends`.

```js
//test will go here
```

You should print the final result using `print(each_pays)`.

```js
//test will go here
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
running_total = 0
num_of_friends = 4

marks_bill = 37.89
jeffs_bill = 57.34
elons_bill = 39.39
my_bill = 64.21

running_total = marks_bill + jeffs_bill + elons_bill + my_bill
tip = running_total * 0.25
running_total += tip
