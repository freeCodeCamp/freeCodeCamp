# --description--
Each person receives their own bill. Benji's bill is `$37.89`, Morty's bill is `$57.34`, Marcy's bill is `$39.39`, and your bill is `$64.21`.

Create four variables for each friend (and yourself): `benjis_bill`, `mortys_bill`, `marcys_bill`, `my_bill`. Then, assign them their respective values and update `running_total` by adding all four variables together.

# --hints--
You should define a variable named `benjis_bill`.

```js
//test will be added later
```

You should define a variable named `mortys_bill`.

```js
//test will be added later
```

You should define a variable named `marcys_bill`.

```js
//test will be added later
```

You should define a variable named `my_bill`.

```js
//test will be added later
```

You should update running_total to be the sum of all four bills.

```js
//test will be added later
```

# --seed--

```py
running_total = 0

benjis_bill = 37.89
mortys_bill = 57.34
marcys_bill = 39.39
my_bill = 64.21

running_total = benjis_bill + mortys_bill + marcys_bill + my_bill
```
