# --description--

Each person receives their own bill. Benji's bill is `$37.89`, Morty's bill is `$57.34`, Marcy's bill is `$39.39`, and your bill is `$64.21`.

Create four variables named `benjis_bill`, `mortys_bill`, `marcys_bill`, and `my_bill`. Then, assign them their respective values and update `running_total` by adding all four variables together. 

Finally, use `print()` to display the string `"Total bill so far:"` followed by the value of your `running_total` variable.
