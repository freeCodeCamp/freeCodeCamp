# --description--

Next, you need to account for the number of people sharing the bill. You can store whole numbers, also known as integers, in variables just like you did in the previous step.

For example, if you were splitting a bill between two people, you might write:

```py
people = 2
```

Create a variable a variable named `num_of_friends` and assign it the value of `4`. This will be used later in the workshop to calculate the final split.

# --hints--

You should have a variable named `num_of_friends`.

```js
// test will be added later
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
running_total = 0
