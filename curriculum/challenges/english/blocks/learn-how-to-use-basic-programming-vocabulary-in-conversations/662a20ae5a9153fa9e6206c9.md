# --description--

`Many` and `much` are used to talk about quantities, but they are used with different types of nouns. `Many` is used with countable nouns, which are things you can count, like `apples`, `cars`, or `books`. For example, you can say `There are many books on the shelf.`

`Much` is used with uncountable nouns, which are things you cannot count individually, like `water`, `sand`, or `information`. For example, you might say `There is not much water left in the bottle.`
