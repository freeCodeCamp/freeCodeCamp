**NOTE**: Some of the interactive examples might use CSS that you haven't learned yet. Don't worry about trying to understand all of the code. The goal of the examples is to show you previews for these design concepts so you better understand how things work.

When you are designing web pages, it is important to create cohesive and visually appealing designs. One way to achieve this is through the use of alignment.

Alignment is the process of arranging text and images in a way that creates a visual connection between elements.

It helps to create a sense of order and organization on the page, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the content.

There are several types of alignment you can use, but the basic ones are:

- left alignment
- center alignment
- right alignment
- justified alignment
- vertical alignment

Left, right, and center alignments are all subtypes of horizontal alignment, while vertical alignment is used to align elements along a vertical axis.

Let's take a closer look at each type of alignment and how you can use them in your designs.

Left alignment is commonly used with text where each element is aligned to the left margin. Aligning all of the headings and paragraphs on a web page to the left margin makes it easier for the user to read and follow the content.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #222;
    max-width: 700px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  h1, h2, h3, p {
    text-align: left;
    margin: 10px 0;
  }

  p {
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
</style>

<h1>Why Left Alignment Matters</h1>
<p>Left alignment is one of the most common and effective ways to present text on web pages.</p>

<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>Aligning all headings and paragraphs to the left margin creates a clean and consistent reading flow.</p>

<h3>Easy to Follow</h3>
<p>Users can easily scan and follow content without confusion or misalignment.</p>
```

:::

The opposite of left alignment is right alignment, where each element is aligned to the right margin. This is often used on websites to display additional content like promotional banners or advertisements.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #222;
    max-width: 700px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  h1, h2, h3, p {
    text-align: right;
    margin: 10px 0;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
  }
</style>

<h1>Right Alignment in Web Design</h1>
<p>Right alignment is commonly used to display additional or promotional content on websites.</p>

<h2>Secondary Content</h2>
<p>Aligning text to the right margin can help separate it visually from the main content.</p>

<h3>Promotional Use</h3>
<p>This alignment is often chosen for banners, advertisements, or sidebar messages.</p>
```

:::

For example, an ad that is aligned to the right margin makes it stand out from the rest of the content on the page but doesn't distract the user from the main content.

Center alignment is where elements are centered on the page. This is often used for headings, logos, and other important elements that you want to draw attention to.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #222;
    max-width: 700px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  h1, h2, h3, p {
    text-align: center;
    margin: 10px 0;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    max-width: 600px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
  }
</style>

<h1>Center Alignment for Impact</h1>
<p>Center alignment is perfect for drawing attention to headings and important elements.</p>

<h2>Eye-Catching Layout</h2>
<p>By centering key content, you make it stand out and create a balanced visual appeal.</p>

<h3>Common Uses</h3>
<p>This technique is often used for logos, hero headings, and call-to-action messages.</p>
```

:::

Justified alignment is when text is aligned to both the left and right margins. This is typically used for descriptive passages or articles, and creates a clean and professional look.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Georgia, serif;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #222;
    max-width: 700px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  h1 {
    text-align: center;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }

  p {
    text-align: justify;
    line-height: 1.7;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>

<h1>Justified Alignment for Clean Text Blocks</h1>

<p>
  Justified alignment ensures that each line of text stretches evenly between the left and right margins. 
  This creates a smooth, block-like appearance that looks very polished and professional. 
  Itâ€™s commonly used in newspapers, magazines, and formal documents where a uniform look is desired.
</p>

<p>
  However, care should be taken with justified text to avoid uneven spacing or "rivers" of white space, 
  especially on narrow columns or screens. Proper hyphenation and responsive design can help maintain readability.
</p>
```

:::

The last type of alignment is vertical alignment, which is used to align elements along a vertical axis.

Vertical alignment can be used, for example, for a contact form on a website. Aligning all of the form inputs like the name, email, and message fields along a vertical axis makes it easier for the user to fill out the form.

:::interactive_editor

```html
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #222;
    max-width: 400px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }

  form {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 15px;
  }

  label {
    font-weight: bold;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
  }

  input, textarea {
    padding: 8px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 4px;
    width: 100%;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }

  button {
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: #007bff;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
    color: white;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  button:hover {
    background-color: #0056b3;
  }
</style>

<form>
  <label for="name">Name</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="e.g., Jane Doe">

  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="janedoe@example.com">

  <label for="message">Message</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" placeholder="Write your message here"></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```
