# --description--

In JavaScript, a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text data. Strings are one of the primitive data types in the language, along with numbers, booleans, `null`, and `undefined`.

To create a string in JavaScript, you can use single quotes (`'`), or double quotes (`"`).

Here is an example of creating two variables that hold string values:

```js
let singleQuotes = 'This is a string';
let doubleQuotes = "This is also a string";
```

Even though you can use single or double quotes to create strings, it's important to be consistent. If a string begins with a single quote, it must also end with a single quote.

The same applies to double quotes. The following example will throw an error because it starts with a double quote and ends with a single quote:

```js
const improperStr = "Do not do this';
```

Another thing to take into account is that strings are immutable. In programming, immutability means that once something is created, it cannot be changed. So, when you create a string, you can't change its characters directly. Instead, you would create a new string if you want to make changes.

Here is an example of assigning a new string to a `developer` variable:

```js
let developer = "Jessica";
developer = "Quincy";
```

Since strings are immutable, we can't update the first string directly. That is why we are assigning a new string to the `developer` variable.

Strings are an important part of programming, and in future lectures, you will learn advanced techniques for manipulating them and harnessing their full potential to create dynamic and interactive applications.
