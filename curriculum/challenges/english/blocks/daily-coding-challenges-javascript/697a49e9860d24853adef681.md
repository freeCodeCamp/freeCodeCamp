# --description--

Given a 2D array of medal winners, return a medal count for each country as a CSV string.

- In the given array, each sub-array represents a single event: `[gold_winner, silver_winner, bronze_winner]`

- The returned CSV string should have the following format, with the first line being headers:

```sh
Country,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total
country_name,gold_count,silver_count,bronze_count,total_medals
```

- Separate new lines with the new line character (`"\n"`).
- Do not include spaces around commas or at the end of lines.
- Sort the returned CSV by gold medal count, highest first. If two countries have the same gold medal count, sort the tied ones alphabetically.

For example, given:

```js
[
  ["USA", "CAN", "NOR"],
  ["NOR", "USA", "CAN"],
  ["USA", "NOR", "SWE"]
]
```

Return:

```sh
"Country,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total\nUSA,2,1,0,3\nNOR,1,1,1,3\nCAN,0,1,1,2\nSWE,0,0,1,1"
```

Which looks like this when printed:

```sh
Country,Gold,Silver,Bronze,Total
USA,2,1,0,3
NOR,1,1,1,3
CAN,0,1,1,2
SWE,0,0,1,1
```
