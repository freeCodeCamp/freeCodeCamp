`It BLANK BLANK the release, but it's better than having a broken product.`

## --blanks--

`might`

### --feedback--

---

`delay`

### --feedback--

This verb means to postpone or make something happen later than planned.

# --explanation--

James uses `might delay` to explain that fixing critical bugs could cause a delay, but it is better than releasing a broken product. Another example:

`We might delay the update.` - Postpone the update to a later time.

Remember, modal verbs are always followed by the base form of the verb (without `to`).
