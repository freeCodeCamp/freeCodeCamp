# --explanation--

`Extent` refers to the degree, scope, or limit of something. It's often used to describe how large, serious, or severe something is. For example:

- `We don't know the extent of the damage yet.` - They are not sure how bad the damage is.

- `He helped with the project, but only to a small extent.` - He helped a little, but not a lot.
