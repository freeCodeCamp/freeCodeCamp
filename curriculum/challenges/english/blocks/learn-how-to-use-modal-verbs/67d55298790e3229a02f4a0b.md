# --explanation--

A `data breach` happens when sensitive information is accessed by unauthorized people. For example:

- `A data breach can happen if hackers get access to private information.` - If cybercriminals steal information, it's called a data breach.

- `Companies must act quickly if there is a data breach.` - When a data breach happens, businesses need to respond fast to fix it.

Jessica says encrypting data and securing encryption keys is essential to prevent this risk.
