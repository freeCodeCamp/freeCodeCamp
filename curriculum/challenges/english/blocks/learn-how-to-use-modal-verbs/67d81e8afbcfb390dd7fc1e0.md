<!-- (audio) Lisa: Have you checked which files were compromised? -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Jake hasn't checked that yet and says the team should focus on something else. What would he say?  

## --answers--

`Not yet, but we should focus on the critical systems first.`

---

`I already checked, and everything looks fine.`

### --feedback--

Jake hasn't checked yet, so he wouldn't be able to confirm this.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

Securing critical systems is usually the first priority before assessing individual files.

`Not yet.` means Jake hasn't checked which files were compromised.

`We should focus on the critical systems first.` means that instead of looking at files, the team should prioritize protecting essential parts of the system.
