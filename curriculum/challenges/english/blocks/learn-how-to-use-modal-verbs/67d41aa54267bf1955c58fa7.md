## --answers--

`Got it. Does that apply to the development team as well?`

---

`I don't understand. Can you repeat that?`

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

The correct answer shows that Mark understood the task and is asking for clarification about whether the rule applies to everyone, including the development team.

`Got it` shows that Mark understands the task.

`Does that apply to the development team as well?` is asking for further details, which makes sense since Jessica's instruction was about setting up multi-factor authentication for all user accounts.
