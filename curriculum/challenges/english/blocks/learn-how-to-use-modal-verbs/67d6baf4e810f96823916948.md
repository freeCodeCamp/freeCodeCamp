Sophie decided to start a discussion on the forum to explore possible challenges in the upcoming software release and get insights from others.

`Forum Post: Preparing for Possible Outcomes in Our Next Software Release`

`Hey everyone,`

`We're getting ready for our next software release, and I wanted to discuss some possible outcomes. Ideally, the deployment will go smoothly, but there's always a chance of bugs appearing. If we run into critical issues, we might have to roll back the deployment and fix them before trying again, which could delay the release.`

`Another concern is performance under high traffic. If too many users join at once, our servers could struggle to handle the load. In that case, we may need to scale up quickly to prevent downtime.`

`How do you usually prepare for these situations? Any best practices for reducing bugs before deployment or ensuring server stability? Let's share some insights!`

What possible problem could happen during the software release?

## --answers--

A security breach.

### --feedback--

Sophie does not mention security concerns.

---

A lack of user interest.

### --feedback--

The concern is too many users, not too few.

# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, look at the problems Sophie describes in the post.

`Bugs appearing` – This tells you there may be technical issues after deployment.

`Servers could struggle to handle the load` – This shows a concern about performance when many users access the system.

These two points help you understand that the possible problems during the release are bugs or traffic-related performance issues.
