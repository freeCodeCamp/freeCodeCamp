Mark decided to email Jessica to update her on his progress and to ask for guidance on a specific issue.

`Subject: Security Protocols Update â€“ Encountering an Issue`

`Hi Jessica,`

`I've started working on the security protocols for the new project. I've updated my software tools to the latest versions and informed the team about setting up multi-factor authentication. Everyone, including QA, is aware that it's mandatory, and we're making sure it's properly implemented.`

`However, I've run into a problem with data encryption. I understand that all sensitive data must be encrypted and that encryption keys must be stored securely, but I'm not sure if we have a specific method or tool for this. Do we have any guidelines on which encryption standards to follow? Also, should we run any tests after encryption to ensure everything is secure?`

`Let me know how to proceed. Thanks for your help!`

`Best,`

`Mark`

Why does Mark ask if tests should be run after encryption?

## --answers--

To check if encryption is slowing down the system.

### --feedback--

Mark is not asking about performance impact.

---

To ensure the encryption process is secure.

---

To verify if encryption is reversible.

### --feedback--

Encryption should protect data, not be easily reversible.

---

To make sure multi-factor authentication is working.

### --feedback--

Mark's question is not about authentication.

# --explanation--

Mark asks if tests should be run `after encryption` to confirm that the process is secure. Testing ensures that encrypted data remains protected and that there are no vulnerabilities in the implementation.

Focus on how Mark is proactively thinking about security validation, not just the encryption process itself.
