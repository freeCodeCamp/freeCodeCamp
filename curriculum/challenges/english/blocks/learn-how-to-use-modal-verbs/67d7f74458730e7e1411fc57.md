# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence is grammatically correct?

## --answers--

`I don't can access my account because I forgot my password.`

### --feedback--

Modal verbs do not use `do` or `does` for negation.

---

`I can't access my account because I forgot my password.`

---

`I no can access my account because I forgot my password.`

### --feedback--

`No can` is incorrect grammar. The correct form is `can't` or `cannot`.

---

`I can accessing my account because I forgot my password.`

### --feedback--

The verb `accessing` is incorrect here. `Can` should be followed by the base form of the verb (`access`).

# --explanation--

To form the negative of a modal verb, you simply add `not` after the modal verb. For example:

- `You shouldn't ignore security updates on your computer.` - It's important to install security updates, so don't skip them.

- `We might not have enough time to finish the project by the deadline.` - There's a chance that they won't finish the project on time.

With modals `can` and `should`, the negative form is usually shortened (`can't` and `shouldn't`).
