<!-- (audio) Jake: It can't be just a random breach. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`It BLANK be just a random breach.`

## --blanks--

`can't`

### --feedback--

This contraction means `cannot` and expresses strong certainty that something is not possible.  

# --explanation--

`It can't be` is used when someone is certain that something is not true or not possible. For example:

- `It can't be true!` - You are sure it is false.

- `That error can't be from my code.` - You are confident your code is correct.

Jake is sure that the security breach was not random â€” he believes it must have been targeted for a reason.
