Jake decided to email the security team to inform them about a recent security breach and request their assistance in the investigation.

`Subject: URGENT. Security Breach Investigation in Progress`

`Hi team,`

`We detected unusual activity on our internal network last night, indicating a potential security breach. While reviewing the logs, we found a high volume of traffic from a specific IP address, which suggests a targeted attack. At this point, we are unsure how they got past our firewall, but we are investigating whether an open port or another vulnerability was exploited.`

`Our immediate steps are:`

`1. Isolating affected systems to prevent further access.`

`2. Running a full security scan to assess the extent of the breach.`

`3. Reviewing access logs to determine which files or systems were compromised.`

`Please prioritize this investigation and report any findings as soon as possible. If you notice anything unusual in the logs or have any insights, let me know immediately.`

`Thanks,`

`Jake`

# --explanation--

To answer the question, look at the section where Jake lists the team's immediate steps.

The first step is `Isolating affected systems`, which is meant to stop the attacker from getting more access. This shows that the purpose is to limit the damage and protect sensitive data before continuing the investigation.

The idea is to act fast to contain the threat and reduce risk.
