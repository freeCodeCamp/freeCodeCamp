# --explanation--

A `targeted attack` is a deliberate cyberattack on a specific person, company, or system. For example:

`Hackers launched a targeted attack against the financial sector.` - This means the attackers had a specific goal instead of just randomly spreading malware.

He suspects that someone specifically planned the attack rather than it being a random cyber threat.
