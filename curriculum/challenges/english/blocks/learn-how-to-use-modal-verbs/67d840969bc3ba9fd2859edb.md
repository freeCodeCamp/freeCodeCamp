## --sentence--

`We should also notify the security team and follow our BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`incident response plan`

### --feedback--

It is a structured process for handling security breaches. Use three words.

# --explanation--

An `incident response plan` (`IRP`) helps organizations react quickly and effectively to cybersecurity threats. For example:

- `Every company should have an incident response plan for cyberattacks.` - Companies need a plan to handle security problems.

- `Without an incident response plan, it's hard to recover from a data breach.` - If there is no plan, fixing security issues can be difficult.
