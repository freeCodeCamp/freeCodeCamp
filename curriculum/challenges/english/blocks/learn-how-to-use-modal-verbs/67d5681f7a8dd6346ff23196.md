# --explanation--

Remember:

`Must` expresses strong necessity or obligation. For example:

`You must wear a seatbelt.`.

`Have to` also expresses obligation but is sometimes less strict than must. For example:

`You have to submit the report by Friday.`.

`Should` is used for recommendations or advice. For example:

`You should review your notes before the test.`.
