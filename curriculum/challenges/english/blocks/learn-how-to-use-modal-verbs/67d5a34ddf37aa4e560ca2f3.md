<!-- (audio) James: It's hard to say. We could have a smooth deployment, but there's always a chance that a few bugs might pop up. It depends on how well we've tested everything. -->

<!-- SPEAKING -->

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

`That makes sense` is used when you understand something and think it is logical. For example:

- Person 1: `If we want to speed up development, we need more people on the team.`

- Person 2: `That makes sense. More people will help us finish the project faster.` - This person agrees because adding more team members can increase productivity.
