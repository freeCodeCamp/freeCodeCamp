# --explanation--

`Unusual activity` refers to behavior that is different from normal. For example:

- `We should investigate any unusual activity on the website.` - They need to check if something strange is happening on the site.

- `If you notice unusual activity, please report it immediately.` - The speaker means people should inform someone right away if they see anything odd.

In this case, `unusual activity on the servers` means that something strange was happening on the network, which could be a sign of a security breach.
