# --explanation--

`Let me know if you need any help or have more questions` is a polite way to show openness and willingness to assist. It's like saying, `I'm here for you if you need anything`.

Jessica is giving Mark the opportunity to reach out if he feels unsure about something or needs further clarification, but she isn't forcing him to ask for help â€” it's optional.
