`must have been`  

### --feedback--  

This phrase is used to make a strong guess about the past based on evidence. Use three words.

# --explanation--

`Must have been` is used to express a strong logical conclusion about the past. For example:

`She is tired. She must have been working all day.` - You're confident she worked all day because she looks exhausted.

Lisa is sure that the firewall settings were not the problem and believes something else caused the breach.
