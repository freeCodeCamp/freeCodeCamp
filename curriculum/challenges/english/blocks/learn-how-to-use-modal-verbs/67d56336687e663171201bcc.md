# --explanation--

`Start with` means beginning a task before moving on to the next one. For example:

- `I will start with fixing the most urgent issues first.` - You'll begin by solving the most important problems.

- `Can we start with the budget planning for the project?` - Let's begin by talking about the budget for the project.

Mark will begin with updates — which likely means software updates — before setting up authentication.
