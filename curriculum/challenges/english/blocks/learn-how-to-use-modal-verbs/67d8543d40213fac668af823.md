Jake decided to email the security team to inform them about a recent security breach and request their assistance in the investigation.

`Subject: URGENT. Security Breach Investigation in Progress`

`Hi team,`

`We detected unusual activity on our internal network last night, indicating a potential security breach. While reviewing the logs, we found a high volume of traffic from a specific IP address, which suggests a targeted attack. At this point, we are unsure how they got past our firewall, but we are investigating whether an open port or another vulnerability was exploited.`

`Our immediate steps are:`

`1. Isolating affected systems to prevent further access.`

`2. Running a full security scan to assess the extent of the breach.`

`3. Reviewing access logs to determine which files or systems were compromised.`

`Please prioritize this investigation and report any findings as soon as possible. If you notice anything unusual in the logs or have any insights, let me know immediately.`

`Thanks,`

`Jake`
