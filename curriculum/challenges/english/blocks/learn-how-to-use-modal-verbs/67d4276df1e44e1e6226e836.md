## --sentence--

`It's a non-negotiable BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`requirement`

### --feedback--

This noun means something that must be done and cannot be skipped.

# --explanation--

A `requirement` is something that must be done. For example:

- `The job has a requirement for at least two years of experience.` - You need at least two years of experience for this job.

- `Fast internet is a requirement for remote work.` - You need fast internet to work from home.

Jessica uses it to emphasize that multi-factor authentication is not optional â€” it is a rule that applies to everyone.
