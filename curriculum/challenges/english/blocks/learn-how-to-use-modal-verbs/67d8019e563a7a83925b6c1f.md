# --explanation--

To find the correct answer, listen to how Lisa responds to the news of the breach.

She says `our firewall settings are usually solid`, which shows that she believes the firewall should have worked. 

This means she finds it strange that the firewall didn't stop the issue, and she thinks the cause must be something else.
