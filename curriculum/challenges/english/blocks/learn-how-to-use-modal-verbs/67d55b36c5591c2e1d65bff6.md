<!-- (Audio) Jessica: Besides that, you should run regular security audits. It's not mandatory, but it's a good idea to catch vulnerabilities early. -->

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Is running regular security audits required for Mark?

## --answers--

No.

---

Yes.

### --feedback--

Jessica says `should`, which suggests a recommendation, not a strict requirement.

## --video-solution--

1

# --explanation--

`Should` is used to suggest or recommend something, but it is not as strong as `must` or `have to`.

Jessica also says `it's not mandatory`, meaning it's not a strict requirement for Mark to run regular security audits. She's simply recommending it because it's a good idea to catch vulnerabilities early, but it's not something he must do.
