# --questions--

## --text--

What does Bob say about her work experience?

## --answers--

She has a long history with tech companies, working there for around ten years.

---

She recently started working with tech companies.

### --feedback--

Bob's statement emphasizes a long-term engagement, not something recent.

---

She no longer works with tech companies.

### --feedback--

Bob indicates that she is still working with them, not that she has stopped.

---

She worked with tech companies only for a short time.

### --feedback--

`about ten years` contradicts the idea of being a short time.
