# --description--

The structure `in + someone's early/late + numbers` is used to talk about a person's age without specifying exactly how old they are.

Examples:

`My brother is in his early 20s.` This gives a general idea that he is at the beginning of his twenties without specifying the exact age.

`My aunt is in her late 50s.` It suggests she is towards the end of her fifties, close to turning 60, but doesn't say the precise age.
