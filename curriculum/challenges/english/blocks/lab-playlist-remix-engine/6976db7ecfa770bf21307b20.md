# --description--
In this lab, you will build a program that creates a single remix playlist from multiple playlists submitted by listeners.

Each listener provides a list of songs they want to hear. Some songs may appear more than once, and some artists may show up too many times. Your job is to work through these playlists step by step: combine them into one list, score each song, remove duplicate songs, limit how often the same artist appears, and then create a final play order.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should accept an array of playlists where each playlist is an array of `{ trackId, artist, title, votes, bpm }`.

2. You should create `flattenPlaylists(playlists)` that converts multiple playlists into a single list of tracks annotated with source metadata indicating where each track originated.

3. You should create `scoreTracks(tracks)` that adds a score field derived from votes and BPM closeness to a target.

4. You should create `dedupeTracks(tracks)` that keeps the earliest submission of each trackId.

5. You should create `enforceArtistQuota(tracks, maxPerArtist)` that removes or reorders tracks exceeding the quota.

6. You should create `buildSchedule(tracks)` that outputs an array of `{ slot, trackId }` objects ready for broadcast.

7. You should create `remixPlaylist(playlists, maxPerArtist)` that turns the original playlists into a final remix schedule. Use the functions you built earlier to complete this process.

# --hints--

You should have a function named `flattenPlaylists`.

You should return an empty array from `flattenPlaylists` when the input is not an array.

Each track returned by `flattenPlaylists` should include a `source` field that is an array like `[playlistIndex, trackIndex]`.

You should have a function named `scoreTracks`.

Each track returned by `scoreTracks` should include a numeric `score` field.

You should calculate `score` using a target BPM of `120` and this formula: `votes * 10 - Math.abs(bpm - 120)`.

You should have a function named `dedupeTracks`.

When duplicate `trackId` values exist, `dedupeTracks` should keep the earliest one (the first time it appears).

You should have a function named `enforceArtistQuota`.

`enforceArtistQuota` should ensure no artist appears more than `maxPerArtist` times by removing extra tracks while keeping the earliest ones.

You should have a function named `buildSchedule`.

`buildSchedule` should return an array of objects with the shape `{ slot, trackId }`, where `slot` starts at `1`.

You should have a function named `remixPlaylist`.

`remixPlaylist` should call the helper functions in order to produce the final schedule.
