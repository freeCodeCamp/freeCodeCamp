<!-- (Audio) Wang Hua: 你好 (nǐ hǎo) -->

# --description--

Congratulations! You've learned Pinyin and now hold the key to unlocking the world of Chinese characters.

Remember that a syllable has three parts: an initial, a final, and a tone? A change in any of these parts can represent a completely different character.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

There's just **one** correct answer. If you need help, click on **explanation** at the bottom of the lesson.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which is the correct Pinyin for what Wang Hua says?

## --answers--

`ní hǎo`

### --feedback--

The tone of the first syllable sounds like the second tone, but it's not written that way.

---

`nǐ hǎo`

---

`nǐ haǒ`

### --feedback--

The tone on `hao` should be placed on `a`, not `o`.

---

`lǐ hǒu`

### --feedback--

The initial of the first syllable and the final of the second syllable are different from what Wang Hua says.

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

Wang Hua is saying `nǐ hǎo`. Both syllables are in the third tone.

Note that the tone of the first syllable sounds the second tone when spoken in this context. This is due to a tone change rule in Chinese called **Tone Sandhi**, which you'll learn about soon.
