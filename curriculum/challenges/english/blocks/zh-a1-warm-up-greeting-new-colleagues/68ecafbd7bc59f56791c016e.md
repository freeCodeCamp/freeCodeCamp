## The Neutral Tone

You've already learned the four main tones in Pinyin: first tone (`ˉ`), second tone (`ˊ`), third tone (`ˇ`), and fourth tone (`ˋ`).

Now you'll learn about the fifth tone: the neutral tone.

The neutral tone is marked by no tone mark and is pronounced with a light and short sound. For example, in `你们好 (nǐ men hǎo)`, the syllable `men` is pronounced with a neutral tone.

Here are more examples of syllables with the neutral tone:

| Word | Meaning| Pinyin |
|------|--------|--------|
| `谢谢` | thank you | `xiè xie` |
| `妈妈` | mom | `mā ma` |
| `爸爸` | dad | `bà ba` |
| `哥哥` | older brother | `gē ge` |
