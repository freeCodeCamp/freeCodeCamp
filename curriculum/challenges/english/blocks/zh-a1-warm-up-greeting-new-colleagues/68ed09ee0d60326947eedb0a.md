# --explanation--

Chen Na is saying `jiā ná dà rén`. The tones are first tone, second tone, fourth tone, and second tone.

Note that the initial of the second syllable might be mispronounced as `l`. The difference between `n` and `l` is that `n` is produced by letting air pass through the nose, while `l` lets air flow around the sides of the tongue.
