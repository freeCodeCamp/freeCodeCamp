## Pinyin Rule - Tone Sandhi

You've just learned your first word in Chinese, `你好 (nǐ hǎo)`. You may have noticed that it sounds like `ní hǎo`. Why?

Both `你 (nǐ)` and `好 (hǎo)` are written in the third tone (`ˇ`). But when you say them together, you don't say two third tones. That's hard to pronounce. So Chinese has a rule called:

**Tone Sandhi Rule**: 3rd Tone + 3rd Tone → 2nd Tone + 3rd Tone

When two third-tone syllables appear together, the first syllable becomes second tone (`ˊ`) and the second syllable stays third tone (`ˇ`). You write the original tones, but say them differently.

Here are some more examples of the Tone Sandhi rule in action:

| Word | Meaning | Pinyin | Pronounced |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| `美好` | beautiful | `měi hǎo` | `méi hǎo` |
| `想法` | idea | `xiǎng fǎ` | `xiáng fǎ` |
| `很好` | very good | `hěn hǎo` | `hén hǎo` |
| `手表` | watch | `shǒu biǎo` | `shóu biǎo` |
| `所以` | so | `suǒ yǐ` | `suó yǐ` |
| `可以` | can | `kě yǐ` | `ké yǐ` |
