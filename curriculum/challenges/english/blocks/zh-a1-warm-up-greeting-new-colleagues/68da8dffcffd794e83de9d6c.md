# --explanation--

The question is asking what Chen Na is saying to greet **a group of people**.

`你好 (nǐ hǎo)` is a greeting to one person, while `您好 (nín hǎo)` is a polite greeting to one person. `您们好 (nín men hǎo)` is not standard in Chinese; `您` is polite singular, not usually pluralized.

The correct phrase for greeting a group is `你们好 (nǐ men hǎo)`, which is a common way to say "hello, everyone". `大家好 (dà jiā hǎo)` is another way to greet a group, which you'll learn as you progress.
