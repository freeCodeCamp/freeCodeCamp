<!-- (audio) Expert: Absolutely. My first suggestion is to not hit the snooze button multiple times. It may be tempting, but it disrupts your sleep cycle and you may feel groggy during the day. -->

# --description--

To `feel groggy` is an informal phrase that means to feel weak, tired, or not fully awake. This often happens after poor sleep or when someone wakes up suddenly. For example:

`I feel groggy if I don't get enough sleep.` - Here, `groggy` describes being tired because of not sleeping well.

`Sluggish` is an adjective that means slow, with little energy or alertness. It can describe people, animals, or even machines. For example:

`I felt sluggish after lunch, so it was hard to focus on work.` - This means you felt slow and tired, not very active.
