<!-- (Audio) James: An early coffee and then breakfast. I had never thought of that. -->

# --description--

`Early` refers to doing something sooner or before the usual time, like waking up early in the morning. For example:

`She likes to start her day early with a jog.` - This means she begins her day in the morning, sooner than usual, by going for a run.

`Late` means doing something after the expected or usual time, like arriving late to a meeting. For example:

`He often works late at the office.` - This means he stays at the office after normal hours and finishes work in the evening or at night.
