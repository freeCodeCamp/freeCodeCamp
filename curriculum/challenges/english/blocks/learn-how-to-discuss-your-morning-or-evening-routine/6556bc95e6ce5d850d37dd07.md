# --description--

Adjectives describe or provide more information about nouns or pronouns. They usually come before the noun they describe. For example:

- `Her older sister is a programmer.` — The adjective `older` describes the noun `sister`. Notice how the adjective `older` comes before the noun.

- `He joined an international company.` — The adjective `international` gives more information about the noun `company`.

- `He has a quick shower in the morning.` - The adjective `quick` describes how short the shower is.

Adjectives can also make language more expressive by giving details about a person, place, or thing. For example, instead of saying `It seems like you have a lot of energy this morning`, you could say `You look energetic this morning`. Here, the adjective `energetic` is more concise and expressive, showing that someone has a lot of energy in a positive way.
