<!-- (Audio) James: Good morning, Sarah. Wow, it seems like you have a ton of energy this morning. -->

# --description--

`It seems like...` is used to share an impression or guess about something, usually based on what you see or notice. For example:

`It seems like it's cold outside!` - This means you haven't gone out yet, but you see people wearing coats, so you think it must be cold.

You can also say, `It seems like it's going to rain`, if you see dark clouds, or `It seems like you're happy today`, if someone is smiling a lot. This phrase is useful when you want to describe what something looks or feels like to you.
