<!-- (Audio) Jake: I want to have a good evening routine too, but it's complicated with my two kids running around. -->

# --description--

Remember, regular verbs usually form the past tense by adding `-ed`. Some of these words can also be used as adjectives.

`Complicated` comes from the regular verb `complicate`. As a verb, it means to make something more difficult. For example, `The problems on the road complicated our trip`. As an adjective, it means something is not simple or easy to do.

`Running around` means moving quickly in different directions, often in a hurried or chaotic way. For example, `The kids are running around the playground`.
