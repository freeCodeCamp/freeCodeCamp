<!-- (Audio) Jake: I want to have a good evening routine, too, but it's complicated with my two kids running around. -->

# --description--

Regular verbs usually add `-ed` to form the past tense. This can also result in some adjectives as in the dialogue.

* `Complicated` is the past tense form of the regular verb `complicate`, as well as the adjective that means something is not simple or easy to do. One example of it as a verb can be: `The problems on the road complicated our trip.`
* `I walked to the store` (Past tense of `walk`)
* `She cleaned her room yesterday` (Past tense of `clean`)

Extra note to help with the audio:

`Running around` means moving about in a hurried or energetic way, often chaotically. For example:

`The kids are running around the playground`
