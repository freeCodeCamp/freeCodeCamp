<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Then, I go straight to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. It's my morning fuel! -->

# --description--

The word `fuel` typically refers to a substance that is used to produce energy, like gasoline for cars or coal for trains. However, in everyday language, people often use `fuel` to describe something that gives them energy or motivation. 

For example, someone might call food or drink their `fuel` if it helps them to start the day with energy.
