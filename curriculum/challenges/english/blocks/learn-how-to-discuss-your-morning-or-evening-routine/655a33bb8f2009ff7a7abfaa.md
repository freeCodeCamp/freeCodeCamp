<!-- (Audio) Expert: Absolutely. My first suggestion is to not hit the snooze button multiple times. It may be tempting, but it disrupts your sleep cycle and you may feel groggy during the day. -->

# --description--

There is a difference between `may be` and `maybe`. Let's take a closer look.

`May be` is the modal verb `may` followed by the verb `be`. It suggests a possibility. For example:

`It may be raining outside.` — Here, `may be` means it is possible that it is raining.

`Maybe` is an adverb. It means perhaps or possibly. For example:

`Maybe I will go out later.` — Here, `maybe` shows uncertainty about going out.

The main difference is that `may be` is a verb phrase, while `maybe` is an adverb.
