# --description--

You can create adjectives that express the highest degree of something. These are the superlative adjectives. They show that nothing else can exceed a certain level.

For short adjectives, you add the article `the` and `-est` to the end of the word. For example, `She enjoys her weekdays to the fullest` (`the` + `full` + `est`).

For longer adjectives, you form the superlative by adding `the most` before the adjective. For example, `This is the most interesting book I've read` (`the most` + `interesting`).

This is an introduction to these adjectives. You'll learn more in the future.
