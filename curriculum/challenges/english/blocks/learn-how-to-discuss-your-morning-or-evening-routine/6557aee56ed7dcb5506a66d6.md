<!-- (Audio) Sarah: Then, I get dressed. Jeans and a T-shirt, you know. Our company has a relaxed dress code and I like to keep it casual. -->

# --description--

A `dress code` is a set of rules about what you should wear in a certain place or event. Different places have different dress codes. For example:

- A `relaxed dress code` means you can wear casual, comfortable clothes.

- A `formal dress code` requires more official and elegant clothes.

Note: Remember, dress codes can vary depending on the culture and the specific place.
