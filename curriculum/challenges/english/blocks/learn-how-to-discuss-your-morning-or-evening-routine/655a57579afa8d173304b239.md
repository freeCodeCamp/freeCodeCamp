<!-- (Audio) Expert: Don't forget to have enough hours of sleep to feel well-rested in the morning. Have a great morning! -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is the final advice the expert gives to Sophie?

## --answers--

`Have a great morning!`

### --feedback--

While encouraging, this is more of a closing remark than the main piece of advice about the morning routine.

---

`Don't forget to have enough hours of sleep to feel well-rested in the morning`

---

`Forget to have enough hours of sleep`

### --feedback--

This goes against the expert's emphasis on the importance of adequate sleep for a good morning routine.

---

`Feel well-rested in the morning`

### --feedback--

This is a desired outcome of following the advice, not the advice itself.
