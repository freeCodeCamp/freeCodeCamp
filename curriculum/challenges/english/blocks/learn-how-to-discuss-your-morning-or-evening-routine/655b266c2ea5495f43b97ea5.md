<!-- (Audio) Maria: On Mondays, I have dance classes from 6 to 7:30. I love dancing. -->

# --description--

To talk about time, you can use the structure: `on` + day(s) + `from` + start time + `to` + end time. This structure helps show both the day and the exact period of time something happens. For example:

- `On Tuesday, I work from 9 to 5.` - This shows the day and the full work schedule.

- `On Sundays, we play football from 4 to 6.` - This shows a routine activity with start and end times.
