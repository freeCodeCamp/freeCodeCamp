<!-- (Audio) Jake: Hey, Sarah. Sophie said you have some good tips for a great morning. -->

# --description--

Past tense verbs are used to talk about actions that already happened. Some verbs change their form in the past tense. For example, `say` becomes `said`:

- `Yesterday, she said she would join us.` - Here, `said` is the past tense of `say`.

- `He said the meeting was at noon.` - Here, `said` tells you about something in the past.

Another similar verb is `tell`, which becomes `told` in the past tense. For example:

- `He told me about the plan last week.` - Here, `told` shows the action happened in the past.

- `Last night, they told stories about our last project.` - Here, `told` is used to describe past storytelling.

The difference is that `say` focuses on the words someone spoke, while `tell` is usually followed by a person and shows who received the information.

Don't worry if irregular verbs feel difficult at first. Practice will help you remember them more easily.
