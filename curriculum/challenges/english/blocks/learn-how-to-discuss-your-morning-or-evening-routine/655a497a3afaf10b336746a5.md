<!-- (Audio) Expert: Another thing: don't skip breakfast. Breakfast gives you the energy to start the day. If you skip it, you probably compensate later by eating too much or you feel sluggish in the morning. Have a balanced breakfast instead. -->
# --description--

Conditional sentences often use the word `if` to describe a situation that will cause a particular result. They typically consist of two parts: the condition (the `if` part) and the result. For example:
