<!-- (Audio) Maria: On Fridays, I like to hang out with friends. We normally meet at a bar, chat, and have something to eat and drink. But I'm not really a night owl, so I like to be back home by 9:30 tops. -->

# --description--

A `night owl` is someone who stays up late. For example, `He's a night owl, often working past midnight`. This means he goes to bed very late.

To `hang out` means to spend time relaxing or socializing. For example, `We hang out at the park on weekends`. This means they spend free time together in the park.

To `be back` means to return. For example, `I'll be back by dinner`. This means you will return before dinner time.

`Tops` is used informally to indicate the maximum amount or time. For example, `The meeting will last one hour, tops`. This means the meeting will take no more than one hour.
