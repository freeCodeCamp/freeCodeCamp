<!-- (Audio) Sophie: So, I'm here because I feel sleepy during the mornings. I don't get productive until it's almost midday. -->

# --description--

Words ending in `-y` often describe a state or quality.

For example, if you add `-y` to the noun `sleep`, you create the adjective `sleepy`, which means feeling a need to sleep or being tired. 

The `-y` ending transforms the noun `sleep` into an adjective describing a condition. Similarly:

- `snow` + `y` = `snowy` (having a lot of snow)

- `rain` + `y` = `rainy` (having a lot of rain)
