<!-- (Audio) Jake: Do you have any ideas that could help? -->

# --description--

Understanding the difference between `can` and `could` is crucial. 

`Can` is used to talk about what someone is able to do, what is possible, or to ask for permission in the present or future. For example:

- `I can code very well.` - Here, `can` shows a present ability.

- `Can I leave early today?` - Here, `can` asks for permission.

`Could` is used in different ways. It can show ability in the past, make a polite request, or suggest something in a softer way. For example:

- `Could you pass me that tool, please?` — Here, `could` makes a polite request.

- `When I first learned programming, I could spend hours debugging without getting tired.` — Here, `could` shows a past ability.
