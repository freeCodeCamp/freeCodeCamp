<!-- (Audio) Maria: On Tuesdays, I learn Japanese. I take online lessons at 7. -->

# --description--

To `take` can mean different things depending on the situation. In the context of learning, to `take` means to attend or participate in a class or course. For example:

- `I take online lessons at 7.` - Here, `take` means to attend the lessons.

- `She is taking a programming course this semester.` - Here, `taking` means she is enrolled in and attending the course.

So, when you say `take lessons` or `take a course`, you are talking about joining or attending them, not physically taking something.
