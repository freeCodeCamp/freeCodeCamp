# --description--

Flex properties are properties that you can apply to flex containers to determine the distribution of child elements. We'll cover some of the most commonly used ones: `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.

Let's start with `flex-wrap`. This property determines how flex items are wrapped within a flex container to fit the available space. `flex-wrap` can take three possible values: `nowrap`, `wrap`, and `wrap-reverse`. `nowrap` is the default valueâ€”flex items won't be wrapped onto a new line, even if their width exceeds the container's width.

In the code below, we have three `div` elements. Let's focus on the `width`. The `main` container bordered in red has a `width` of `200px`, while its three child `div` elements combined have a `width` of `240px` (`80px` each):

```css
main {
  width: 200px;
  display: flex;
  border: 2px solid red;
}

div {
  width: 80px;
  height: 50px;
}

#first-div {
  background-color: #4d70b2;
}

#second-div {
  background-color: #5c4db2;
}

#third-div {
  background-color: #4da3b2;
}
```

The width of the `div` elements exceeds the width of their container, but by default they will be shrunk to fit the available space. If you do want to wrap them when they exceed the width of their container, you can set `flex-wrap: wrap` on the flex container:

```css
flex-wrap: wrap;
```

The `div` elements will be rearranged in rows when they exceed the width of their container. You can wrap flex items in reverse order with `flex-wrap: wrap-reverse`. The `flex-flow` property is a shorthand property for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`. In this example, we set `flex-direction` to `column` and `flex-wrap` to `wrap-reverse`:

```css
flex-flow: column wrap-reverse;
```

Great. Now let's talk about `justify-content`. `justify-content` aligns the child elements along the main axis of the flex container. If you assign the value `flex-start` to `justify-content`, the flex items will be aligned to the start of the main axis. This could be horizontal or vertical:

```css
justify-content: flex-start;
```

With `justify-content: flex-end`, flex items are aligned to the end of the main axis, horizontally or vertically. To center the flex items along the main axis, you can use `justify-content: center`. To distribute the elements evenly along the main axis, you can use `justify-content: space-between`. This will add some space between the flex items if needed.

`justify-content: space-around` distributes flex items evenly within the main axis, adding a space before the first item and after the last item. This additional space is half of the space between each pair of adjacent items. If there's only one item to distribute, it will be centered.


And last but not least, we have `justify-content: space-evenly`, which distributes the items evenly along the main axis. The space between the items and the space before and after the first and last elements, are exactly the same:

```css
justify-content: space-evenly;
```

Great. Now you know how to distribute flex items along the main axis. But you may also want to distribute them along the cross axis. Remember that the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis. You can do this with the `align-items` property. To center the items along the cross axis, you just need to add `align-items: center` to the flex container: 

```css
align-items: center;
```

In this example, the flex items are centered along the cross axis, which is vertical by default. If the cross axis is horizontal, they will be centered horizontally instead. In contrast, `align-items: flex-start` aligns the items to the start of the cross axis:

```css
align-items: flex-start;
```

The opposite is `align-items: flex-end`. This will align flex items to the end of the cross axis, vertically or horizontally. To stretch the flex items along the cross axis, you can use `align-items: stretch`. This also works with elements that are automatically sized, such as those without set `width` or `height`, or with only a minimum `width` or `height`. The flex items will stretch to fill the container in the direction of the cross axis.

And finally, you can use the `align-self` property to assign a different alignment on the cross axis to an individual flex item. For example, you can stretch it with `align-self: stretch`. You can center it with `align-self: center`. You can align it to the start of the cross axis with `align-self: flex-start`. Or you can align it to the end of the cross axis with `align-self: flex-end`.

## Controlling Item Order and Growth

Two additional properties give you precise control over individual flex items: `order` and `flex-grow`.

The `order` property lets you rearrange flex items without changing the HTML structure. By default, all items have an `order` of `0` and appear in source order. Items with higher `order` values appear later, while negative values move items earlier:

```css
.first-item {
  order: 3; /* Appears last */
}

.second-item {
  order: 1; /* Appears first */
}

.third-item {
  order: 2; /* Appears middle */
}
```

The `flex-grow` property controls how much an item should grow relative to other items when extra space is available. A value of `0` (the default) means the item won't grow. Higher numbers mean the item will claim more of the available space:

```css
.sidebar {
  flex-grow: 0; /* Stays at its natural size */
}

.main-content {
  flex-grow: 1; /* Takes all available space */
}

.featured-section {
  flex-grow: 2; /* Grows twice as much as items with flex-grow: 1 */
}
```

These properties are particularly useful for creating responsive layouts where content needs to reorder for different screen sizes or where sections should dynamically resize based on available space.

There are other flex properties and values that you can choose from to create the responsive layout that you envision, but these are the most commonly-used ones. With these CSS flex properties and your new knowledge of the CSS flex model, you can start creating responsive layouts to create a smooth and inclusive user experience across devices.

## --text--

What happens when you apply `order: -1` to a flex item that normally appears third in the source HTML?

## --answers--

It moves to the end of the flex container after all other items.

### --feedback--

Think about how negative order values affect positioning.

---

It becomes invisible with negative positioning.

### --feedback--

The order property doesn't affect visibility, only positioning.

---

It moves to the beginning of the flex container before all other items.

---

It stays in the same position since order can't be negative.

### --feedback--

Order values can be negative and they affect positioning.

## --text--

In a flex container with three items where item A has `flex-grow: 0`, item B has `flex-grow: 1`, and item C has `flex-grow: 2`, how is extra space distributed?

## --answers--

All items get equal extra space.

### --feedback--

Think about how flex-grow values determine space distribution.

---

A gets none, B gets 1/3 of the extra space, C gets 2/3 of the extra space.

---

Only item C gets all the extra space since it has the highest value.

### --feedback--

Multiple items can share extra space based on their flex-grow ratios.

---

A gets all the space since flex-grow: 0 means it claims everything.

### --feedback--

flex-grow: 0 means the item doesn't grow at all.
