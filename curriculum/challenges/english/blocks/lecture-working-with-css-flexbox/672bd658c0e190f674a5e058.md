# --description--

When working with flexbox layouts that span multiple lines, you need to understand the difference between `align-items` and `align-content`. This distinction is crucial for creating professional layouts like pricing card grids, dashboard widgets, and responsive galleries.

Let's start with a common scenario: you have a flex container with `flex-wrap: wrap` that creates multiple lines of items. Here's where `align-content` becomes essential.

## Understanding align-content vs align-items

The `align-items` property aligns individual flex items within their line along the cross axis. Think of it as controlling how each item sits within its own row or column.

The `align-content` property, however, aligns the entire lines themselves when you have multiple lines. It controls the spacing and alignment of the wrapped lines as a group.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  height: 400px;
  align-content: space-between; /* Aligns the lines themselves */
  align-items: center; /* Aligns items within each line */
}
```

## align-content Values and Their Effects

Here are the key `align-content` values and when to use them:

**`align-content: flex-start`** - Packs lines to the start of the cross axis. Useful for top-aligned card grids.

**`align-content: flex-end`** - Packs lines to the end of the cross axis. Great for bottom-aligned layouts.

**`align-content: center`** - Centers the lines in the cross axis. Perfect for centered card layouts.

**`align-content: space-between`** - Distributes lines with equal space between them. Ideal for evenly spaced sections.

**`align-content: space-around`** - Distributes lines with equal space around them. Creates consistent spacing.

**`align-content: space-evenly`** - Distributes lines with equal space between and around them. Modern browsers only.

**`align-content: stretch`** - Stretches lines to fill the container. The default value.

## Real-World Example: Pricing Card Layout

Consider a pricing card layout where you want three cards per row on desktop, but they should wrap to fewer cards per row on smaller screens:

```css
.pricing-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  min-height: 500px;
  align-content: space-around; /* Distributes rows evenly */
  gap: 20px;
}

.pricing-card {
  flex: 1 1 300px; /* Grow, shrink, basis */
  min-width: 280px;
  align-self: stretch; /* Individual card alignment */
}
```

This creates a responsive layout where cards wrap naturally and the resulting rows are evenly distributed vertically.

## The flex-grow Property in Multi-line Contexts

When working with multi-line layouts, `flex-grow` affects how items grow within their specific line, not across lines:

```css
.card {
  flex-grow: 1; /* Grows to fill available space in its line */
}

.featured-card {
  flex-grow: 2; /* Grows twice as much as regular cards */
}
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using align-content on single-line containers** - It has no effect unless `flex-wrap: wrap` creates multiple lines.

2. **Confusing align-content with justify-content** - `justify-content` works along the main axis, `align-content` works along the cross axis for multiple lines.

3. **Forgetting container height** - `align-content` needs available space to distribute. Set a `min-height` or `height` on the container.

## Best Practices for Multi-line Layouts

1. **Always set flex-wrap: wrap** when you want items to wrap to new lines.

2. **Use align-content for line distribution** and `align-items` for individual item alignment.

3. **Combine with gap property** for consistent spacing between items.

4. **Test responsiveness** - ensure your layout works as items wrap to different numbers per line.

Understanding `align-content` unlocks powerful layout possibilities, especially for card-based designs, dashboard layouts, and responsive galleries where content needs to flow naturally across multiple lines.

# --questions--

## --text--

In a flex container with `flex-wrap: wrap` that creates three lines of items, which property controls the spacing between those three lines?

## --answers--

`align-items`

### --feedback--

Think about which property controls the alignment of multiple lines as a group.

---

`justify-content`

### --feedback--

This property works along the main axis, not for line distribution along the cross axis.

---

`align-content`

---

`gap`

### --feedback--

While gap affects spacing, it doesn't control the distribution of lines themselves.

## --text--

What happens when you apply `align-content: space-between` to a flex container with only one line of items?

## --answers--

The items are spaced evenly across the line with equal space between them.

### --feedback--

Think about when align-content actually has an effect.

---

Nothing happens because align-content only works with multiple lines.

---

The items are centered within the container.

### --feedback--

This would be the effect of align-items: center, not align-content.

---

The items stretch to fill the container height.

### --feedback--

This would be align-items: stretch, and align-content needs multiple lines to work.

## --text--

In a pricing card layout, you want the cards to wrap to new lines as needed and have the resulting rows distributed evenly with space around each row. Which CSS would achieve this?

## --answers--

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-around;
}
```

### --feedback--

This affects horizontal spacing of items, not vertical distribution of lines.

---

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: space-around;
}
```

### --feedback--

align-items doesn't accept space-around as a value, and it works on individual items, not lines.

---

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-content: space-around;
}
```

---

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-content: space-around;
}
```

### --feedback--

flex-direction: column changes the layout direction, and you'd need flex-wrap for multiple lines.
