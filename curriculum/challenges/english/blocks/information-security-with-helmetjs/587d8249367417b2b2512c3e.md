# --description--

As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project cloned from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">GitHub</a>.

If you are releasing an update for your website, and you want the users to always download the newer version, you can (try to) disable caching on clientâ€™s browser. It can be useful in development too. Caching has performance benefits, which you will lose, so only use this option when there is a real need.

# --instructions--

Use the `helmet.noCache()` method on your server.

# --hints--

helmet.noCache() middleware should be mounted correctly

```js
const response = await fetch(code + '/_api/app-info');
if (!response.ok) {
  throw Error(await response.text());
}
const data = await response.json();
assert.include(data.appStack, 'nocache');
assert.equal(
  data.headers['cache-control'],
  'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate'
);
```
