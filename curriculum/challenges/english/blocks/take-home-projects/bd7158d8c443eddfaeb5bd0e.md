# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://chart-the-stock-market.freecodecamp.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://chart-the-stock-market.freecodecamp.rocks/</a>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** You can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.

**User Story:** You can add new stocks by their symbol name.

**User Story:** You can remove stocks.

**User Story:** You can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
