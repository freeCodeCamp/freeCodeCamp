# --description--

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV</a>.

**Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2:** Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see the weather in my current location.

**User Story:** I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.

**User Story:** I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

**Note:** Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (`https://`) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API <a href="https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/</a> which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to <a href="https://codepen.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">CodePen.io</a> via `https://`.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
