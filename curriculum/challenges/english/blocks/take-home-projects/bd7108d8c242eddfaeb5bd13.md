# --description--

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/mVEJag>.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

**User Story:** I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

**User Story:** I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/meteorite-strike-data.json>

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
