# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: <a href="https://image-search-abstraction-layer.freecodecamp.rocks/query/lolcats%20funny?page=10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://image-search-abstraction-layer.freecodecamp.rocks/query/lolcats%20funny?page=10</a> and browse recent search queries like this: <a href="https://image-search-abstraction-layer.freecodecamp.rocks/recent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://image-search-abstraction-layer.freecodecamp.rocks/recent/</a>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** You can get the image URLs, description and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given search string.

**User Story:** You can paginate through the responses by adding a `?page=2` parameter to the URL.

**User Story:** You can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
