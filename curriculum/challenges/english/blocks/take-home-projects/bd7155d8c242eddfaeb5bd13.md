Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can create recipes that have names and ingredients.

**User Story:** I can see an index view where the names of all the recipes are visible.

**User Story:** I can click into any of those recipes to view it.

**User Story:** I can edit these recipes.

**User Story:** I can delete these recipes.

**User Story:** All new recipes I add are saved in my browser's local storage. If I refresh the page, these recipes will still be there.

**Hint:** You should prefix your local storage keys on CodePen, i.e. `_username_recipes`
