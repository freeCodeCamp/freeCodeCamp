# --description--

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/</a>.

The Twitch API is a RESTful API that lets developers build creative integrations for the broader Twitch community.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

**User Story:** I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.

**User Story:** If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

**Hint:** Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: `["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]`

**UPDATE:** Due to a change in conditions on API usage, Twitch.tv requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use <a href="https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/</a> instead of Twitch's API base URL and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
