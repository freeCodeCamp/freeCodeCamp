<!-- (audio) Sophie: Wow, that's incredible! But what about ethical concerns? -->

# --description--

`Ethical concerns` are like moral questions we ask ourselves about what is right and wrong. In everyday life, we think about what is fair, honest, and kind. In the world of programming, `ethical concerns` are the moral decisions and worries that programmers have about the impact of their work on people and society. For example, programmers need to think about user privacy, fairness, and safety when creating software.

Examples: `Programmers need to consider ethical concerns in their work.`

`When you have ethical concerns, you think about the impact of the content on users and society.`
