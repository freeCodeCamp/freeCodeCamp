<!-- (Audio) Tom: Well, AI is everywhere, from chatbots that help with customer service to self-driving cars that use AI to navigate safely. -->

# --description--

In English, the phrase `from... to...` is used to show a range or a journey between two points or values. It indicates where something starts from one point and ends at another.

For example, if you say, `I work from Monday to Friday`, it means your workdays are from Monday (the starting point) to Friday (the ending point). It's a way of expressing the entire span between two specific things or times.

In simpler terms, `from... to...` helps you talk about the beginning and ending parts of something, like a time period, a place, or a range of numbers.

Complete the sentence with the correct phrase.
