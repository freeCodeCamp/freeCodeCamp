# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --questions--

## --text--

What is Sophie asking Brian to do?

## --answers--

She is asking Brian to solve the coding challenge for her.

### --feedback--

Sophie is seeking Brian's perspective, not asking him to solve it entirely.

---

She wants Brian to ignore her coding work.

### --feedback--

This option is the opposite of her request; she's asking for input, not for it to be ignored.

---

She is inviting Brian to collaborate on a different project.

### --feedback--

Sophie's request is specific to the coding challenge she's currently working on, not a different project.
