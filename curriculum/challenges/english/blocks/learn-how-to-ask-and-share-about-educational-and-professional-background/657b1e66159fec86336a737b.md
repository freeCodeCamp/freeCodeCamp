<!-- (Audio) Sophie: No, not really. I played around with coding, but most of my projects involved circuit designs and electrical systems. -->

# --description--

Typically, the `Past Simple` tense is formed by adding `-ed` to regular verbs. For example, the verb `play` becomes `played`.

To `play around` means to try something in a casual or experimental way, often just to see what happens. It's usually followed by `with`. For example:

`He played around with the new software to see how it works.` - This means he tried using the software without a serious plan, just to explore it.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does `I played around` in Sophie's sentence suggest about her experience with coding?

## --answers--

She casually experimented with coding in the past.

---

She is currently playing a coding game.

### --feedback--

`Played` is in the past tense, indicating a past action, not something happening currently.

---

She plans to start coding soon.

### --feedback--

`Played` implies she already has some experience with coding, not that she is planning to start.

---

She never tried coding.

### --feedback--

Using `played` confirms she did engage in coding, contradicting the idea of never trying it.
