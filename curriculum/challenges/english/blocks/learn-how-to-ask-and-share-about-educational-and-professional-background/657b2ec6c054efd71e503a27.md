# --description--

`Actually` is used to show the real fact about something. You use it when you want to correct someone or make your point stronger. It's like saying: "This is the truth". For example:

`He thought the project was finished, but actually, there are still some tasks left.` - This corrects the idea. The project is not finished yet.
