<!-- (Audio) Anna: Hello. Thanks for coming in today. Could you tell me about your previous roles and responsibilities? -->

# --description--

`Previous` is used to describe something that happened before the current time or situation. It's often used to refer to past experiences, jobs, or events. For example:

- `In my previous job, I worked as a web designer.` - Here, `previous` describes the job the person had before the current one.

- `We talked about this in the previous meeting.` - Here, `previous` shows that the meeting happened before the current one.
