<!-- (Audio) Candidate: We were responsible for the checkout process, and it was a successful implementation. -->

# --description--

The term `checkout process` refers to the steps involved in completing a purchase, whether in a physical store or online. In a physical store, this usually involves taking items to a cashier, paying, and receiving a receipt. In online shopping, it includes adding items to a cart, entering shipping and payment details, and finalizing the order.
