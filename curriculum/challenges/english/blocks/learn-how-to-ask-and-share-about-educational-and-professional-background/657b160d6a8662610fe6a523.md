# --description--

The `Past Simple` tense is used for actions or situations that were completed in the past.

Regular verbs in the past tense usually end with `-ed`, while irregular verbs have unique past forms. For example, as you learned in previous tasks, `was` and `were` are the past forms of `is` and `are`.

Here's more examples of the `Past Simple` tense:

- `I worked at a company.` - Here, `work` becomes `worked`.
- `I was happy.` - Here, `is` becomes `was`.
- `We were busy.` - Here, `are` becomes `were`.
