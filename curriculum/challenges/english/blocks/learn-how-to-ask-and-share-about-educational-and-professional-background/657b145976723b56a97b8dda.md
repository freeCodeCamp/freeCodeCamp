<!-- (Audio) Candidate: I have a bachelor's degree in computer science from California State University. During my studies, I was introduced to various programming languages and software development principles. -->

# --description--

`I was introduced to...` is in the `past simple` passive form. It uses the verb `to be` (`was`) plus the past participle `introduced`. This structure is often used to show that something happened to the subject, not by the subject. For example:

`At college, I was introduced to many programming languages.` - During college, the speaker started learning or became familiar with different programming languages.
