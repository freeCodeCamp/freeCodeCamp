<!-- (Audio) Anna: I saw that tech companies appreciate innovation and care for their employees' well-being. -->

# --description--

An `employee` is a person who works for a company or another person.

Talking about `employees' well-being` means you're discussing the health and happiness of the people working at a place. The `'` after `employees` shows that the well-being belongs to them.

Another example is `the project's code`, which means the code belongs to one project. If you're talking about several projects and say `the projects' code`, it means the code belongs to more than one project.
