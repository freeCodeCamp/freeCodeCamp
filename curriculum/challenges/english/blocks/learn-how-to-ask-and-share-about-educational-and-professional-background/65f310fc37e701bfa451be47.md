<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Hey! Yeah, I joined the team a few months ago. I didn't study computer science at university, but I majored in electrical engineering. It wasn't exactly tech-related, but I learned a lot about problem solving and critical thinking. -->

# --description--

When you study at a university, you choose a main subject. This is called `majoring`. For example, if someone says, `I majored in biology`, it means their main area of study was biology. 

The word `major` is a regular verb. In the past tense, you can often add `-ed` to the end of regular verbs. So, `major` becomes `majored` to talk about the past.
