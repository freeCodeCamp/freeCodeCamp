<!-- (Audio) Anna: I actually studied psychology in college. My plan was to become a therapist or counselor. -->

# --description--

Both a `therapist` and a `counselor` help people with their feelings and problems, but there is a small difference:

- A `counselor` usually gives short-term help. They listen, give advice, and guide people through specific problems, like stress at work or family issues.

- A `therapist` usually gives longer-term help. They may have more training and work with deeper mental health issues, like anxiety, depression, or trauma.
