<!-- (Audio) Brian: That's interesting. So you didn't work on many programming projects during your studies, did you? -->

# --description--

When you want to ask about something that happened in the past, you can often use `did` to start the question. The word `did` helps to turn a statement into a question. For example:

- `You worked on the project.` - This is a statement in the past tense. The verb `worked` shows the action happened in the past.

- `Did you work on the project?` - This is a question. Here, `did` is added at the beginning, and the main verb `work` stays in the base form.
