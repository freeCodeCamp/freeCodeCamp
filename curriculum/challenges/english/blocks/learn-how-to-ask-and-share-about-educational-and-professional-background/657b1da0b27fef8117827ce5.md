<!-- (Audio) Brian: Hey, how's it going? I noticed you're relatively new here. -->

# --description--

You've already learned about the `Past Simple` tense. Now, you can explore it further.

The `Past Simple` tense is often formed by adding `-ed` to a verb. But, when a verb ends with an `-e`, you just add a `-d`. For example, `notice` becomes `noticed`.

To `notice` means to become aware of something, often because you see or realize it. For example:

`She noticed a mistake in the report.` - This means she saw the mistake.
