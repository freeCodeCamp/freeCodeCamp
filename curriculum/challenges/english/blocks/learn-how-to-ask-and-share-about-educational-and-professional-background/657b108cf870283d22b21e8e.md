<!-- (Audio) Candidate: Good afternoon. Sure. I was a programmer in Acme Tech. -->

# --description--

The `Present Simple` tense is used to describe habitual or usual actions. However, when you are talking about past roles or experiences, like in an interview, you should use the `Past Simple` tense. 

The `Past Simple` tense often involves changing verbs: `is` becomes `was` for singular subjects and `are` becomes `were` for plural subjects. For example:

- `I am a teacher` in the present becomes `I was a teacher` for past experiences.

- `They are engineers` changes to `They were engineers` when speaking about the past.
