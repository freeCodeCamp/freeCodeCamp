<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Alice. How did you get into tech?
Alice: My background is a bit unconventional. -->

# --description--

`Unconventional` means something that is different from the normal way of doing things. It shows that a person, idea, or action does not follow the usual rules or traditions. For example:

`The team had an unconventional meeting outside the office.` - This means the meeting was not in the usual place, but somewhere different.

# --questions--

## --text--

What does `unconventional` imply about Alice's background in tech?

## --answers--

Her background is different from the usual way people get into tech.

---

Her background is exactly the same as most people in tech.

### --feedback--

`Unconventional` means not following the usual conventions, which contradicts being the same as most people.

---

She doesn't have any background in tech.

### --feedback--

`Unconventional` suggests a different approach, not the absence of a background.

---

She followed a very traditional path into tech.

### --feedback--

`Unconventional` indicates a non-traditional path, not a very traditional one.
