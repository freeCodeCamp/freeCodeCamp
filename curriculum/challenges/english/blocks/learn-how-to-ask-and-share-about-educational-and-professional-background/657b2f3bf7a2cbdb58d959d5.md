<!-- (Audio) Anna: But during my last year, I took a course in organizational psychology. -->

# --description--

`Last` helps you talk about the time that just passed. 

When you say `last year`, it means the year that finished before this one. `Last month` is the month that ended before this one. And `last week` is the week that came before this week. 

Using phrases like `last year`, `last month`, `last week`, or `last day` is a way to talk about things that happened not too long ago.
