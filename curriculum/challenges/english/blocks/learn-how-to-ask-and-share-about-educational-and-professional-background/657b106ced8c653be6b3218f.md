<!-- (Audio) Anna: Good afternoon! Thanks for coming in for this interview. Can you tell me about your previous job experiences? -->

# --description--

`Can you tell me about...?` is a polite way to ask for information. You use it when you want someone to explain or give details about something. For example:

`Can you tell me about the project?` - This asks for more information about the project.

`Previous` is an adjective that means earlier than now or before the present time or event. It is often used to talk about something that happened earlier in time or something that came before another thing. For example:

`I couldn't join the previous meeting.` - Here, `previous` means the meeting that happened before this one.
