<!-- (Audio) Brian: I studied at a small college as well and majored in information technology. -->

# --description--

The rule for conjugating verbs in the past tense that end with `-y` depends on the letter before the `-y`. Here's how it works:

If the verb ends with a **vowel followed by `-y`**, simply add `-ed` to the end of the verb. For example, `stay` becomes `stayed`.

If the verb ends with a **consonant followed by `-y`**, change the `-y` to `-i` and add `-ed`. For example, `study` becomes `studied`.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I BLANK at a small college as well and BLANK in information technology.`

## --blanks--

`studied`

### --feedback--

The `past simple` tense of `study` is formed by changing `-y` to `-i` and adding `-ed`.

---

`majored`

### --feedback--

This word follows the regular `past simple` tense formation by just adding `-ed`.
