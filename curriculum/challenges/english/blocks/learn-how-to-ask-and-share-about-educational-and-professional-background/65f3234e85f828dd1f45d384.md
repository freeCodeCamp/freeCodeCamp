<!-- (Audio) Brian: That's interesting. So you didn't work on many programming projects during your studies, did you? -->

# --description--

When someone uses a question like `did you?` at the end of a sentence, they are usually asking for confirmation about what they believe is true. It's a way of checking information. It is usually formed with an auxiliary verb (`do`, `to be`, `have`, or a modal verb) and the subject.

- If the main sentence is positive, the tag is negative. For example, `You studied programming, didn't you?`

- If the main sentence is negative, the tag is positive. For example, `You didn't study programming, did you?`

In the dialogue, Brian adds `did you?` after his statement to check if what he thinks about Sophie's programming experience is correct.
