## Introduction to Dynamic Programming

- **Definition**: Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results to avoid redundant calculations. 
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: The same smaller problems appear multiple times when solving the larger problem. Instead of recalculating these subproblems repeatedly, we store their solutions.
- **Optimal Substructure**: The optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems. This means we can build up the best solution by combining the best solutions to smaller parts.

## Dynamic Programming Solutions

- **Memoization (Top-Down Approach)**: Memoization stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again. 

```py
def climb_stairs_memo(n, memo={}):
    """Dynamic programming with memoization"""
    # Check if we've already calculated this value
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]  # Return cached result - O(1) lookup!
    
    # Base cases
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Calculate once and store in memo for future use
    memo[n] = climb_stairs_memo(n-1, memo) + climb_stairs_memo(n-2, memo)
    return memo[n]
```

- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)**: Tabulation builds the solution from the ground up, filling a table with solutions to subproblems.

```py
def climb_stairs_tabulation(n):
    """Dynamic programming with tabulation"""
    if n <= 2:
        return n
    
    # Create array to store results for all steps from 0 to n
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[1] = 1  # 1 way to reach step 1
    dp[2] = 2  # 2 ways to reach step 2
    
    # Build up the solution iteratively
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # Ways to reach step i = ways to reach (i-1) + ways to reach (i-2)
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]
```

## Real-World Applications Using Dynamic Programming

- **Route Optimization**: GPS systems use dynamic programming algorithms to find shortest paths between locations.
- **Text Processing**: Spell checkers and autocomplete features often rely on dynamic programming to calculate edit distances between words.
- **Financial Modeling**: Investment strategies and portfolio optimization frequently employ dynamic programming techniques.
- **Resource Allocation**: The knapsack problem and its variants appear in scheduling, budgeting, and resource management.

## When to Use Dynamic Programming

You should consider using dynamic programming in the following scenarios:

- The problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems.
- The problem exhibits optimal substructure.
- A naive recursive solution would involve repeated calculations.
- You need to optimize for time complexity at the cost of space complexity.
