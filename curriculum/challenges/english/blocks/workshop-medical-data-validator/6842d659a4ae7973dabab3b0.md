- A key `diagnosis` with the value of `Hypertension`
- A key `medications` with the value of the list `['Lisinopril']`
- A key `last_visit_id` with the value of `V2301`.

# --hints--

You should have a `diagnosis` key with the value of the string `Hypertension` in your dictionary.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
assert medical_records[0].get("diagnosis", None) == "Hypertension"
`) })
```

You should have a `medications` key with the value of the list `['Lisinopril']` in your dictionary.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
assert medical_records[0].get("medications", None) == ['Lisinopril']
`) })
```

You should have a `last_visit_id` key with the value of the string `V2301` in your dictionary.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
assert medical_records[0].get("last_visit_id", None) == "V2301"
`) })
```

You should have a `patient_id` key with the value of the string `P1001` in your dictionary.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
assert medical_records[0].get("patient_id", None) == "P1001"
`) })
```

You should have a `age` key with the value of the integer `34` in your dictionary.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
assert medical_records[0].get("age", None) == 34
`) })
```

You should have a `gender` key with the value of the string `Female` in your dictionary.

```js
({ test: () => runPython(`
assert medical_records[0].get("gender", None) == "Female"
`) })
```
