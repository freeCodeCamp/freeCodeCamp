If you are using your mobile to navigate throught the Spanish curriculum you will need to make sure your phone is ready to use accents. With just a few settings and tricks, you can quickly add characters like `á`, `é`, or `ñ` right from your mobile keyboard.  

## The Quick Press-and-Hold Trick  

The simplest way to type accented letters is by pressing and holding the letter you need.  

1. Open a text field in any app, such as messages or notes.

2. Press and hold the letter key, for example `a` or `n`.

3. A pop-up menu will appear with accented versions like `á`, or `ñ`.

4. Slide your finger to the character you want and lift to select it.  

This is perfect when you only need accents occasionally.  


## Adding Language Keyboards  

It can feel a bit troublesome to find the correct accent in Spanish, so adding a Spanish keyboard layout helps. This gives you quicker access to accents and other characters.


### On Android  

1. Open **Settings**.

2. Go to **System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard**.

3. Choose your keyboard app, like Gboard.

4. Tap **Languages**.

5. Add Spanish.

6. Tap **Done** to finish.  


### On iPhone  

1. Open **Settings**.

2. Go to **General > Keyboard**.

3. Tap **Keyboards**, then **Add New Keyboard**.

4. Select Spanish.

5. Use the globe icon on your keyboard to switch between language layouts.


## Trying Third-Party Keyboards  

You can also explore apps like **SwiftKey**, **Gboard**, or **Grammarly**. These often include smart suggestions, multilingual support, and faster ways to type accents.  

Now you are all set to go through the Spanish curriculum and complete the tasks, specially those that require accents.
