If you're using your mobile device to go through the Spanish curriculum, you'll need to make sure that your device is ready to type accent marks and special characters, like `á`, `é`, or `ñ`.

## The Quick Press-and-Hold Trick  

The simplest way to type accented letters is by pressing and holding the letter you need.

1. When the keyboard is displayed, press and hold the letter key, for example `a` or `n`.

2. A pop-up menu will appear with accented versions like `á`, or `ñ`.

3. Slide your finger to the character you want and lift to select it.

This is perfect when you only need accents occasionally. 


## Adding Language Keyboards  

Another alternative would be adding a Spanish keyboard layout, which can be helpful to have quicker access to accents and other characters.

### On Android  

1. Open **Settings**.

2. Go to **System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard**.

3. Choose your keyboard app, like Gboard.

4. Tap **Languages**.

5. Add Spanish.

6. Tap **Done** to finish.


### On iPhone  

1. Open **Settings**.

2. Go to **General > Keyboard**.

3. Tap **Keyboards**, then **Add New Keyboard**.

4. Select Spanish.

5. Use the globe icon on your keyboard to switch between language layouts.


## Third-Party Keyboards  

You can also install different apps for your phone or tablet to use the Spanish keyboard with ease. These apps often offer handy features like smart suggestions, support for multiple languages, and faster ways to type accent marks.

Now you're all set to go through the Spanish curriculum and complete the tasks, specially those that require accent marks.
