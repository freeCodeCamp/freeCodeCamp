Welcome to the **A1 Spanish for Professionals** certification, Camper! We're thrilled to have you here. This program is all about guiding you **step by step** as you build real, practical Spanish skills from the ground up that you can use in professional settings.

Here’s the breakdown of how the certification is structured and how you'll learn:


## Chapters and Modules

The entire certification is divided into **chapters**, and each chapter contains several **modules**. You can think of a chapter as a major topic and a module as a specific, focused lesson within that topic.

Every **module** focuses on a specific communication goal based on different professional situations. To help you get into a smooth learning rhythm, the modules will often follow the same structure:

1.  **Warm-up:** You'll start by meeting new **words and phrases** or reviewing content that's relevant to the module. You’ll complete short tasks to recognize and get familiar with the key vocabulary.
2.  **Learn:** This is where you see the new words in action! You'll listen to short **monologues or dialogues** and answer questions to understand their meaning and how they're used in real conversations.
3.  **Practice:** Time to try it out! You'll complete more open-ended tasks that test your comprehension and your ability to write in Spanish.
4.  **Review:** At the end of each module, you'll find a **grammar summary** and a **glossary**. These are super useful reference tools you can use to reinforce what you've learned and revisit later if you need a quick refresher.
5.  **Quiz:** Finally, there's a short quiz to assess what you remember. Quizzes usually include **10 to 20 questions** and are designed to test your knowledge without hints. Don't worry, you can retake them as many times as you need, and your score is completely private.


## Learn at Your Own Pace

This certification is **self-paced**, which means you are **free to learn on your own schedule**. Whether you power through it on a weekend or do a little bit each day, it's completely up to you!

If you ever get stuck or just need a little support, you can click on the **Ask for Help** button. That will connect you with other learners in the forum where you can ask questions and help each other out.


## A Quick Tech Note

Since you'll be doing some writing practice, you'll need to make sure you have the **Spanish Keyboard** setup on your laptop or mobile device. This is important for easily typing accents and other special characters.

***The instructions on how to set up the Spanish keyboard are up next!***
