If you'll use a computer to go through the Spanish curriculum, you'll need to make sure it's ready to type accents and special characters, like the `ñ`. 

Setting this up is quick, whether you use Windows or Mac. It only takes a few minutes.

## Setting Up on Windows 11

1. Open **Settings** from the Start menu.

2. Go to **Time & language**, then click on **Language & region**.

3. Go to **Preferred languages** and choose **Add a language**.

4. Search for **Spanish** and choose a variant such as `Español (Latin America)`.

5. Click **Next** and then follow the steps.

Once the language is installed:  

- Find it in your **Preferred languages** list.

- Click on the ellipsis to show additional options and select **Language options**.

- Go to **Keyboards**, click on **Add a keyboard** and select the Spanish layout you prefer.

To switch between keyboards:  

- Press **Windows key + Spacebar**.

- Or click the language icon on your taskbar (often marked as **ENG**) and choose Spanish.

## Setting Up on Mac

1. Open the **Apple Menu** and select **System Settings**.

2. Go to **Keyboard**.

3. Go to **Text Input** > **Input Sources**.

4. Click on **Edit...**

5. Click on the **plus (+)** button at the bottom and select **Spanish** from the list.

6. Click on **Add**.

Now you're all set to go through the Spanish curriculum and complete the tasks, including those that require accent marks and special characters.
