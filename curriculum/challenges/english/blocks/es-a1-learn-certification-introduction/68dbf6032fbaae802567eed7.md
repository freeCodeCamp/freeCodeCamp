If you are using your computer for the Spanish curriculum, you'll need to make sure it's ready to type accents and special characters like the `ñ`. Setting this up is quick, whether you use Windows or Mac. It only takes a few minutes.

## Setting Up on Windows 10 or 11  

1. Open **Settings** from the Start menu.

2. Go to **Time & Language**, then click **Language**.

3. Under **Preferred languages**, choose **Add a language**.

4. Search for **Spanish** and pick a variant such as `Español (latin America or Mexico)`.

5. Click **Next** and then **Install**.


Once the language is installed:  

- Find it in your **Preferred languages** list.

- Click on it and select **Options**.

- Under **Keyboards**, choose **Add a keyboard** and select the Spanish layout you prefer.
 

To switch between keyboards:  

- Press **Windows key + Spacebar**.

- Or click the language icon on your taskbar (often marked as **ENG**) and pick Spanish.


## Setting Up on Mac  

1. Open the **Apple Menu** and select **System Preferences**.

2. Go to **Keyboard**.

3. Click the **Input Sources** tab.

4. Select the **plus (+)** button and add **Spanish** from the list.  

Now you are all set to go through the Spanish curriculum and complete the tasks, including those that require accents
