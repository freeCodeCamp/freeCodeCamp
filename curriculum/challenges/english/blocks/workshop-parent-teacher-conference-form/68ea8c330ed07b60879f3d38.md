# --description--

Now it is time to add the form elements to collect the students grade information.

Start by adding another `label` element with the text `Student Grade: ` and `for` attribute set to `"grade"`.

Then below your `label` element, add an `input` element with the `type` attribute set to `"number"`. The `name` and `id` attributes should be set to `"grade"`. The `placeholder` attribute should be set to `"Ex. 4"`. Lastly, your number `input` should be required.
