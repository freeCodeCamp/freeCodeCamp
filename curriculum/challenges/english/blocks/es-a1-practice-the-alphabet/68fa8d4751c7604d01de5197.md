# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and answer the question below.

# --questions--

## --text--

Is it true or false: The letter `n` is in the audio.

## --answers--

True

### --feedback--

Listen to the audio one more time. A very similar letter is pronounced, but it's not the letter `n`.

---

False

## --video-solution--

2

# --explanation--

These are the three letters pronounced in the audio: `g`, `m`, `t`.

The letter `m` sounds very similar to the letter `n`, but they are different letters in Spanish. You will learn to identify them with practice.

Therefore, the answer is false because the letter `n` is not pronounced in the audio.
