# --description--

So far, you've exercised how to ask questions with `do` / `does` and make negative sentences with `don't` / `doesn't`. Let's review them. Remember:

- Affirmative: `He does work on weekends.` (means the person works on weekends)

- Negative: `He doesn't work on weekends.` (means the person does not work on weekends)

- Interrogative: `Does he work on weekends?` (asks if the person works on weekends)

# --instructions--

Read the dialogue excerpt and fill in the blanks using `do` or `don't`.
