<!-- (audio) Sophie: She schedules team meetings every Monday morning to plan the week ahead. -->

# --description--

When you have meetings to `plan ahead`, it means you discuss and decide on things that will happen in the future. It helps everyone know what to do before things happen. For example:

- `He plans ahead for his meetings every week.` - He organizes his meetings before they happen.

- `Plan ahead if you want to finish the project on time.` - Prepare early to finish the project before the deadline.
