<!-- (audio) Sophie: Electric, for sure. Back to your hobbies, though. Do you have any favorite photography themes? -->

# --description--

You sometimes use special words or short phrases to return to a topic that was mentioned earlier. This helps the listener follow the conversation and reminds them what you were talking about. For example:

- `Back to our budget discussion, I think we need more details.` - This shows you are moving the conversation back to talking about the budget after talking about something else.

- `As I was saying, the project deadline is next Friday.` - This means you are continuing from a point you were making before you were interrupted or before the topic changed.
