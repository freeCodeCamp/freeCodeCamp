<!-- (audio) Sophie: Occasionally, yeah. It depends on the project's needs. -->

# --description--

`It depends on` is used to say that the answer to a question can change based on different things. For example:

How long it takes to make a website depends on how big or small the job is.
Choosing the coding language depends on the computer or system we use.

Notice that after `depends` there's always the preposition `on`. 

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio to complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Occasionally, yeah. It depends BLANK the project's needs.`

## --blanks--

`on`

### --feedback--

The missing word is not `of,` `in,` or `at,` which are also prepositions but don't fit in this phrase.
