<!-- (audio) Sophie: Occasionally, yeah. It depends on the project's needs. -->

# --description--

To `depend on` is used to say that something can change based on different things. For example:

- `The project depends on good teamwork.` - The project will succeed only if the team works well together.

- `Developers depend on tests to find errors.` - Programmers need tests to see if the code has mistakes.

Notice that after `depend` there's always the preposition `on`.
