# --description--

When you speak about what another person does every day, like your friend or a teacher, and you use `he,` `she,` or `it` you will often need to conjugate the verb of your sentence. 

As you already studied, for most verbs conjugation can be simple. You just  add `s` or `es` to the end of the verb.

For example:

Verb `to talk` conjugation:

- `I talk`, `you talk`, `we talk`, and `they talk`.

- `He talks`, `she talks`, and `it talks`.

Verb `to do` conjugation:

- `I do`, `you do`, `we do`, and `they do`.

- `He does`, `she does`, and `it does`.
