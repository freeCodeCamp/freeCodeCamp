# --description--

You learned that `do` is an auxiliary verb that helps ask questions. You have also learned that when you want to ask about something specific, you can use the question word `what`. 

When you want to ask about someone's job or role, you use `what` with `do` to form a question. For example, `What do you do?` means `What is your job?`

When talking about another person like Maria, you say `What does she do?` because `she` is a third person singular (`she`, `he`, `it`), and with these subjects, `do` changes to `does`.
