# --description--

`To look like` is used to describe someone's or something's appearance, often implying a comparison.

When you're curious about someone's physical characteristics, such as their hair color, height, or overall look, you might use expressions like:

`What does (he/she) look like?` or `What do they look like?`

The choice between these depends on the number and gender of the person you're asking about. Use `does` with singular pronouns `(he, she)` when referring to one person and `do` with `they` when referring to someone whose gender might not be known or if referring to people in a non-binary or plural sense.

**Note:** Remember that questions about a person's appearance can be sensitive. Some people may not feel comfortable discussing physical traits, and it's important to respect their feelings. Always use this question politely and in the right context, where it is appropriate to do so.
