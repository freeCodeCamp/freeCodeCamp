<!-- (audio) Tom: How about you? Do you have any hobbies? -->

# --description--

So far you have learned how to create questions with the verb `to be`. In sentences with the verb `to be` (`am`, `is`, `are`) you just have to change the order of the noun and the verb to create a question. Like this:

| Affirmative | Interrogative |
| --- | --- |
| `You are a developer.` | `Are you a developer?` |

Changing the order of the noun and the verb doesn't work in every situation. Most sentences need you to add an auxiliary verb to create questions. One of the most common auxiliary verbs is `do`.

You can use the verb `do` as an auxiliary to most verbs. In the present tense it assumes the form of `do` (for `I`, `you`, `we`, `they`) and `does` (for `he`, `she`, `it`). It is like a marker you will add to the beginning of your sentence; this will let everyone know that sentence is a question. For example:

| Affirmative | Interrogative |
| --- | --- |
| `You debug on Fridays.` | `Do you debug on Fridays?` |
