<!-- (audio) Sarah: Oh, yeah! 'Gartic' is another favorite. Maybe we can play some 'Gartic' on the next game night? -->

# --description--

In this part of the dialogue, Sarah suggests playing `Gartic` on the next game night. She uses the phrases `Maybe` and `we can` to express the possibility of this happening.

`Maybe` is a word used when you are suggesting a possibility, but you are not sure if this possibility will happen or not. It shows that you are not making a definite plan, but you are open to the idea. For example: if someone asks you if you want to go to the movies, you can say `Maybe` if you are not sure if you want to go or if you are available.

`We can` is used to suggest an idea or propose something in a polite way. It shows that the people in the conversation have the ability or the option to do something. For example, if you want to suggest playing a game, you can say `We can play a game` to offer the idea.

The difference between `maybe` and `we can` is that `maybe` suggests a possibility without making a definite plan, while `we can` suggests an idea or proposal in a polite way.
