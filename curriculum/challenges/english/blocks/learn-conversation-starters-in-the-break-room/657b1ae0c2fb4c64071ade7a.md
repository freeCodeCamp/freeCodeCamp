# --description--

When you want to ask about something specific, you can use the question word `what`. `What` is commonly used to talk about things. 

You usually put `what` at the beginning of a question. Then you follow it with the verb `to be` (like `is` or `are`) or other verbs, and then the subject (like `you` or `the team`). 

For example: `What is your name?` or `What are they doing?`

# --questions--

## --text--

Choose the correct question that Tom is asking Sarah:

`Absolutely! They are really fun. What is the team's favorite?`

## --answers--

What do they like the most?

---

What is the team's favorite color?

### --feedback--

Color is not the answer; Tom is asking about a fun thing the group likes to do.

---

What time is the game night?

### --feedback--

Tom isn't asking `when`. He wants to know `what` the group enjoys.

---

What are you doing later?

### --feedback--

Tom is not asking about what Sarah will do later; he is asking about what everyone enjoys together.
