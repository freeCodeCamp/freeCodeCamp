<!-- audio: "Many of us enjoy the monthly game night." -->

# --description--

The suffix `-ly` can be added to words to indicate the frequency of an event. Here's how it applies to different time periods:

- `Daily` means it occurs once every day.
- `Weekly` indicates something that happens once every week.
- `Monthly` describes something that happens once every month. 
- `Yearly` (or annually) describes something that happens once every year.
