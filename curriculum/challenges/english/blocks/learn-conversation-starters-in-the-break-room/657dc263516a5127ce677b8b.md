<!-- (audio)Sophie: Not too long. They usually take about 30 to 45 minutes. -->

# --description--

When talking about the duration of time something requires, you use the word `take.` For example, you can say, `It takes me 10 minutes to get to the subway.`

When expressing opinions about time, phrases like `too long` or `not too long` are used. `Too long` suggests that the time is more than what is preferred, while `not too long` suggests that the time is just right or reasonable.
