<!-- (audio) Tom: Hmm... Do we discuss all our ongoing projects in these meetings?
Sophie: We do. It's a chance to update everyone on project progress. -->

# --description--

`Ongoing` means that something is happening right now and it has not finished yet. It continues for some time, and it is still in progress. For example:

`There is an ongoing project at the company.` - The project is still happening and not completed.

Think of `ongoing` as something that is still active and not done.
