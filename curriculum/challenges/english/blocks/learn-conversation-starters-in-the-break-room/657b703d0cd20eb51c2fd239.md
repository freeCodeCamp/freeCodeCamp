# --description--

Let's practice creating negative sentences with an auxiliary verb.

# --questions--

## --text--

Choose the sentence that correctly uses `don't` to express what someone does not do.

## --answers--

`I don't coding on weekends.`

### --feedback--

When used with `don't`, `coding` should be in the base form `code`.

---

`I don't code on weekends.`

---

`I don't codes on weekends.`

### --feedback--

When used with `don't`, the verb should not have an `-s` at the end.

---

`I does not code on weekends.`

### --feedback--

`Does not` is used with third-person singular subjects (`he`, `she`, `it`); with `I`, it should be `do not`.
