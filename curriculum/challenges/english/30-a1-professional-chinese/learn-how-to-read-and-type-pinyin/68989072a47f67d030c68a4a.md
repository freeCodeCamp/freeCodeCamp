# --description--

`e` is the third of the six single finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce `e`, open your mouth slightly and keep the lips relaxed without rounding. The tongue is positioned in the middle of the mouth, neither high nor low. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.
