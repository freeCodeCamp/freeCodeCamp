<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: c, ci, cu -->

# --description--

The initial `c` is pronounced like `z`, but with a strong puff of air. Place the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper teeth, then release it with a sharp burst of breath.  

When `c` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `ci` and `cu`.

Remember that the `i` in `ci` is not a regular vowel. It's a buzzing sound made by extending the `c` sound without moving your tongue.
