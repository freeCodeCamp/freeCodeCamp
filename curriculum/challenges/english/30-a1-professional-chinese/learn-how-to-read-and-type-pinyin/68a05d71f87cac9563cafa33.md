<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uen -->

# --description--

`uen` is a smooth, connected sound. To pronounce it, you begin with a rounded `u`, then pass quickly through a light `e` sound, and finish with the front nasal `n` by lightly touching the tongue tip behind your upper front teeth.

In standard spelling, `uen` is usually written as `un`.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `u` in `un`. For example, `Å«n`.

[ ] pronouncing `uen`
