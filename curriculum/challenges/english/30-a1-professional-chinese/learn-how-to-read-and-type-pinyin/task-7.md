<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: u -->

# --description--

`u` is the fifth of the six simple finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce `u`, round your lips and push them slightly forward, but do not make them too tight. The tongue is raised high at the back of the mouth while the jaw stays relaxed. The sound should be short and focused, not overly long.

[ ] pronouncing `u`

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final.
