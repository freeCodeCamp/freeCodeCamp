# --description--

In the previous compound final tasks, you may have noticed how the tone marks were placed in Pinyin, such as `ái`, `ào`, and `uó`.

Tone marks are always placed on vowels, not on consonants.

Here are three rules for deciding which vowel gets the tone mark:

- If `a` is present, the tone mark is placed on `a`.

- If there is no `a`, but there is `o` or `e`, the tone mark goes on whichever appears. These two will never appear together in the same final.

- If `i` and `u` appear together, the tone mark goes on the second one.
