<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uan -->

# --description--

`uan` is a smooth blend that starts with the rounded vowel `u` and ends with the nasal `n` sound.

Begin by rounding your lips tightly to pronounce `u`, then quickly open your mouth slightly to produce a short vowel like `a`, and finish with the nasal `n` sound by gently touching the tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

Although the spelling is `u-a-n`, the middle `a` is very short and light. It should feel like one connected syllable, not three separate parts.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `uan`. For example, `u√°n`.
