<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ch, chi, chu -->

# --description--

The initial `ch` is pronounced by curling the tip of your tongue backward toward the roof of your mouth and releasing it with a strong, sharp puff of air. While `c` uses a flat tongue placed behind the upper teeth, `ch` requires the tongue to curl backward, creating a deeper and more resonant sound.

When `ch` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `chi` and `chu`.

Remember that the `i` in `chi` is not pronounced as a separate vowel but rather as a buzzing extension of the `ch` sound itself, created by maintaining the curled tongue position and allowing the sound to vibrate gently.
