<!-- (Audio) A: ang -->

# --description--

`ang` is the first back nasal final you learn.

Unlike front nasals which end in `n` with the tongue tip behind the upper teeth, back nasals end with `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

To pronounce `ang`, start with the open vowel `a`, then let the sound continue into the back nasal `ng`. Keep the mouth open and allow the sound to resonate at the back of the throat.  

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `ang`.
