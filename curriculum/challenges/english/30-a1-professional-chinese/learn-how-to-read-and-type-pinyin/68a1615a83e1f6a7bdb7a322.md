<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ang -->

# --description--

`ang` is the first back nasal final you learn.

Unlike front nasals which end in `n` with the tongue tip behind the upper teeth, back nasals end with `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.

To pronounce `ang`, start with the open vowel `a`, then let the sound continue into the back nasal `ng`. Keep the mouth open and allow the sound to resonate at the back of the throat. The transition should be smooth without any break.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `ang`.

[ ] pronouncing `ang`
