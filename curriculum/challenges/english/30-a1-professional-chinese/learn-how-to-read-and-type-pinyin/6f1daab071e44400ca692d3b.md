<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uei, dui, tui, gui, kui, zhui, shui -->

# --description--

To pronounce `uei`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`, then smoothly transition to the position for `e`, and finally to the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

In syllables, `uei` is often written as `ui`.

When `uei` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `dui`, `tui`, `gui`, `kui`, `zhui`, `shui`.
