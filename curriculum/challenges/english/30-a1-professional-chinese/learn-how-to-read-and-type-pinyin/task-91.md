<!-- (Audio) A: iou, liu, jiu, qiu, xiu, you -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`iou` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`, then smoothly transition to the position for `o`, and finally to the position for `u`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `iou` is combined with the initials `l`, `j`, `q`, `x`, `y`, you get the syllables: `liu`, `jiu`, `qiu`, `xiu`, `you`.
