<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: en, ben, men, fen, zhen, shen, ren -->

# --description--

`en` is a front nasal final. Like `an`, it ends with the nasal `n` sound.

To pronounce `en`, you begin with a tighter mouth shape than `an`, then lightly press the tip of your tongue behind your top teeth to finish with `n`.

This nasal final is short, quick, and forward in the mouth.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `ben`, `pen`, `men`, `fen`, `zhen`, `chen`, `shen`, and `ren`.
