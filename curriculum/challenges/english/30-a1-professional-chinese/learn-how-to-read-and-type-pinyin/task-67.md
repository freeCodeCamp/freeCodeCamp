<!-- (Audio) A: ai, bai, tai, gai, kai, cai, zhai -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`ai` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth open wide for the `a` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `a` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `i` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ai` is combined with the initials `b`, `t`, `g`, `k`, `c`, `zh`, you get the syllables: `bai`, `tai`, `gai`, `kai`, `cai`, `zhai`.

This principle applies to all compound finals, whether they contain two or three vowels, ensuring a seamless and connected pronunciation within the syllable.
