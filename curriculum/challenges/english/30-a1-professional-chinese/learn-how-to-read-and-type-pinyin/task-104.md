<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: en, ben, pen, men, fen, zhen, chen, shen, ren -->

# --description--

`en` is a front nasal final. Like `an`, it ends with the nasal `n` sound.

To pronounce `en`, you begin with a tighter mouth shape than `an`, then lightly press the tip of your tongue behind your top teeth to finish with `n`.

This nasal final is short, quick, and forward in the mouth.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `e` in `en`. For example, `Ã©n`.
