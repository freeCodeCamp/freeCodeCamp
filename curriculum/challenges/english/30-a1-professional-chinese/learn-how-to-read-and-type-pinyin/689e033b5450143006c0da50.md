# --description--

In Mandarin Chinese, tones are an integral part of pronunciation.

Each Pinyin syllable is spoken with a specific tone, and these tones are just as important as the initials and finals in determining its pronunciation.

A change in tone can completely alter the meaning of a syllable, even when the initials and finals remain exactly the same.

There are four main tones:

- First tone (`ˉ`): A high, level pitch maintained consistently throughout the syllable.

- Second tone (`ˊ`): A rising pitch that starts in the mid-range and moves upward to a high ending point.

- Third tone (`ˇ`): A dipping tone that begins in the mid-range, descends to a low point, then rises back up.

- Fourth tone (`ˋ`): A sharp falling pitch that starts high and drops quickly to the bottom of the vocal range.

(Here is the Mandarin Four Tones Chart)

Here are the six simple finals in all four tones:

| Final | 1st Tone | 2nd Tone | 3rd Tone | 4th Tone |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| a     | ā(audio)        | á(audio)        | ǎ(audio)        | à(audio)        |
| o     | ō(audio)        | ó(audio)        | ǒ(audio)        | ò(audio)        |
| e     | ē(audio)        | é(audio)        | ě(audio)        | è(audio)        |
| i     | ī(audio)        | í(audio)        | ǐ(audio)        | ì(audio)        |
| u     | ū(audio)        | ú(audio)        | ǔ(audio)        | ù(audio)        |
| ü     | ǖ(audio)        | ǘ(audio)        | ǚ(audio)        | ǜ(audio)        |

There is also a neutral tone, which is short and soft. It is not marked with any tone mark. You'll learn more about the neutral tone later.
