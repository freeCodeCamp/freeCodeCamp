<!-- (Audio) A: l, la, le, li, lu, lü -->

# --description--

The initial `l` is pronounced by placing the tip of your tongue firmly against the ridge behind your upper front teeth while letting air flow smoothly around the sides of your tongue. Unlike the nasal `n` sound where air passes through your nose, with `l` all the air escapes through your mouth around your tongue.

When `l` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, `i`, `u`, and `ü`, you get the syllables: `la`, `le`, `li`, `lu`, and `lü`.

Like `n`, `l` is one of few consonants that pair with `ü`.
