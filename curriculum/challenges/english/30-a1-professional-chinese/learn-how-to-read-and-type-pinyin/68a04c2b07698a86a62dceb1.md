<!-- (Audio) A: an -->

# --description--

There are 16 nasal finals in Pinyin. These are syllables that end with a nasal sound, either `n` (front nasal) or `ng` (back nasal).

The nasal final `an` is the first one you learn. It's made of a simple vowel plus a nasal ending.

To pronounce `an`, start with the short vowel `a`, then lightly close the airflow with your tongue touching behind your top teeth to make the `n` sound. Your lips should stay relaxed and slightly open.

This is a front nasal final because the tongue tip makes the nasal sound in the front of the mouth.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `an`. For example, `ƒÅn`.
