<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: s, si, su -->

# --description--

The initial `s` is pronounced by placing the tip of your tongue close to the back of your upper front teeth, allowing air to flow steadily through the narrow gap.

When `s` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `si` and `su`.

Note that the `i` in `si` is not a regular vowel sound. It simply extends the `s` sound with a soft buzzing quality.
