<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ian -->

# --description--

The front nasal final `ian` may look like it has three parts: `i`, `a`, and `n`, but its real pronunciation is more like a fast blend of `i` and a light nasal ending.

Start by forming the high front vowel `i`, with your tongue close to the roof of your mouth and your lips slightly spread. Then, glide quickly into a very short transition sound similar to `ɛ` (like the `e` in `bed` in English), and end with the front nasal `n`, using the tip of your tongue behind your upper teeth. The sound should be smooth and continuous.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `ian`. For example, `ián`.
