<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: er -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`er` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `e` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue toward the position for `r`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `e` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `r` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate sounds.

[ ] pronouncing `er`
