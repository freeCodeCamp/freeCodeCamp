<!-- (Audio) A: ua, hua, kua, gua, shua -->

# --description--

`ua` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`. Then, without breaking the sound, open the mouth wider into the position for `a`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ua` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `hua`, `kua`, `gua`, `shua`.
