<!-- (Audio) A: üe -->

# --description--

`üe` begins with rounded lips and the tongue pushed slightly forward for `ü`. Then, as the sound continues, the lips relax and the tongue moves down into the position for `e`.

The movement is smooth but requires attention to keep the `ü` sound clear before opening into `e`.

On most systems, you type `ü` by writing `v`. For example, to type `üe`, you can type `ve`. The software will convert it into `üe`.

For tone marks, when `a` is absent but `e` is present, the mark is written on `e`. For example, `üè`.
