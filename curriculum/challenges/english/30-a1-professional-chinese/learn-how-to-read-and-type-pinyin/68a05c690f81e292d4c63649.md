<!-- (Audio) A: üan -->

# --description--

`üan` starts with the special vowel `ü`, which is pronounced by shaping your lips like you're saying `u` (rounded), but placing your tongue as if you're saying `i`.

To pronounce `üan`, begin with `ü`, then open your mouth slightly for a short `a`-like sound, and finish with the nasal `n` by touching your tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

It's important to keep the rounded lip shape at the start. Don't pronounce it like `uan`.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `üan`. For example, `üán`.
