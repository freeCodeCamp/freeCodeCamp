<!-- (Audio) A: ai -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`ai` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth open wide for the `a` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `a` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `i` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

This principle applies to all compound finals, whether they contain two or three vowels, ensuring a seamless and connected pronunciation within the syllable.
