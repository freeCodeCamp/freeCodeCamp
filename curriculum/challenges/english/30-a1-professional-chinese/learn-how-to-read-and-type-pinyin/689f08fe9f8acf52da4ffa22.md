<!-- (Audio) A: ou -->

# --description--

`ou` starts with the lips rounded slightly for `o`. As you keep the sound going, bring the lips closer together and raise the tongue toward the middle of the mouth to reach `u`.

Keep the transition steady so the two parts connect naturally. The `o` sound is emphasized slightly longer, while the `u` is shorter and lighter.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

This is the compound final which glides smoothly from `o` to `u` without any break between the sounds.
