<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ou -->

# --description--

`ou` starts with the lips rounded slightly for `o`. As you keep the sound going, bring the lips closer together and raise the tongue toward the middle of the mouth to reach `u`.

Keep the transition steady so the two parts connect naturally. The `o` sound is emphasized slightly longer, while the `u` is shorter and lighter.

[ ] pronouncing `ou`

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final.
