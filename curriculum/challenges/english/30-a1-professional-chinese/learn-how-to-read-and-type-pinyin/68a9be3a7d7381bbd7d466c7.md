<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: w, wu, wo -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, the letter `w` acts as a ​spelling guide​ (like `y`) for syllables beginning with the vowel `u`. While `w` isn't a full consonant, its behavior differs slightly depending on the syllable.

The `w` ​in `wu` is silent. It simply marks that the syllable starts with the vowel `u`.

The `w` in `wo` adds a subtle `u`-like glide (a very quick `u` sound) before the main vowel. This glide helps transition smoothly into the `o` sound.
