<!-- (Audio) A: iao, biao, miao, diao, jiao, qiao, xiao -->

# --description--

To pronounce `iao`, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`, then smoothly transition to the position for `a`, and finally to the position for `o`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `iao` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `biao`, `miao`, `diao`, `jiao`, `qiao`, `xiao`.
