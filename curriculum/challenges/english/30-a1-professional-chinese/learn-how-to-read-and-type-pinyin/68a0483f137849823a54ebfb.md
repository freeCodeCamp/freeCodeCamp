<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: er -->

# --description--

`er` is the last of the compound finals you'll learn here.  

To pronounce it, start with your mouth slightly open and the tongue low, then curl the tongue tip slightly backward toward the roof of the mouth while making the `er` sound. Keep the lips relaxed.  

For tone marks, since `er` contains only one vowel, the mark is always placed directly on it. For example: `Ä›r`.
