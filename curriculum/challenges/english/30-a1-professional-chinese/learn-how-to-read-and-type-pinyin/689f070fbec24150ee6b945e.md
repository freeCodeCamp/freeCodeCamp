<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ao -->

# --description--

`ao` starts with the mouth wide open as for `a`. Then, without stopping the sound, slowly round your lips and lower your jaw slightly to move toward `o`.

Make the movement steady so that the sound changes naturally from the first part to the second.

[ ] pronouncing `ao`

# --assignment--
