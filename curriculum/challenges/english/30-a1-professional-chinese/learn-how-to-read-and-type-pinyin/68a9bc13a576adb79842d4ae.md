<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: y, yi, yu -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, the letter `y` isn't a full consonant. It acts as a ​spelling helper​ used when a syllable begins with the vowel sounds `i` or `ü`. Its main job is to make the syllable easier to read and write.

Examples:

- `yi` is simply the vowel `i`, and the `y` is added to show the syllable starts with this sound.

- `yu` represents the vowel `ü`, but the two dots are dropped when written with `y`.

In both cases, the `y` itself is silent. It only signals that the following vowel is the core of the syllable. This rule helps learners avoid confusion and pronounce these vowel-opening syllables correctly.

[ ] pronouncing `y`  
[ ] pronouncing `yi`  
[ ] pronouncing `yu`

# --assignment--
