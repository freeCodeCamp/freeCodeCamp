<!-- (Audio) A: o -->

# --description--

`o` is the second of the six single finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce it, round your lips and push them slightly forward. Keep your tongue pulled back and raised up, and keep your jaw relaxed. Hold the sound steadily for two seconds: `o——`. Avoid making it too short or tight. Let the sound flow smoothly.
