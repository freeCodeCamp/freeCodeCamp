<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: g, ga, ge, gu -->

# --description--

The initial `g` is pronounced by raising the back of your tongue to touch the soft roof at the back of your mouth, then quickly releasing it without a puff of air. It sounds like a crisp, short click in your throat, with no vibration in your throat and no burst of breath.

When `g` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ga`, `ge`, and `gu`.
