<!-- (Audio) A: iao -->

# --description--

Up to now, the compound finals you have learned, such as `ai`, `ei`, `ao`, and `ou`, are made of two vowel sounds. Now you will learn a group of four compound finals that are made of three vowel sounds.  

`iao` can be thought of as `ia` + `o`. Start with the tongue high and close to the roof of the mouth for `i`. Then open the mouth wide for `a`. Finally, round the lips slightly to move into `o`. Make the change between each part smooth and natural.

Since `a` is included, the tone mark is always placed on `a`. For example, `i«éo`.
