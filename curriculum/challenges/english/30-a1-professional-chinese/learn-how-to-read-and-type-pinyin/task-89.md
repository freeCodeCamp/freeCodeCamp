<!-- (Audio) A: iao, biao, miao, diao, jiao, qiao, xiao -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`iao` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`, then smoothly transition to the position for `a`, and finally to the position for `o`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `iao` is combined with the initials `b`, `m`, `d`, `j`, `q`, `x`, you get the syllables: `biao`, `miao`, `diao`, `jiao`, `qiao`, `xiao`.
