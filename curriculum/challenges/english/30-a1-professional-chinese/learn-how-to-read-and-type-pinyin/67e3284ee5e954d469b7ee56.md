<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: z, za, ze, zu -->

# --description--

The initial `z` is pronounced by placing the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper front teeth. It's similar to the English "ds" sound in "beds" or "dz" sound in "adze".

When `z` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `za`, `ze`, and `zu`.
