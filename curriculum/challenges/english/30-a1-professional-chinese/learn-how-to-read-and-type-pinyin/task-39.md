<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: k, ka, ke, ku -->

# --description--

The initial `k` is pronounced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate, just like `g`. But unlike `g`, `k` is aspirated. When you release it, there is a strong puff of air.

To practice, try saying `k` and feel a strong puff of air hit your hand if you hold it in front of your mouth. Then, try the same with `g` and you should feel almost no air. 

When `k` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ka`, `ke`, and `ku`.
