<!-- (Audio) A: pa, po, pi, pu -->

# --description--

To pronounce the initial `p`, firmly press your lips together and then release them with a quick, strong burst of air. This puff of air is what makes `p` different from `b`, which uses the same lip position but releases the sound gently without pushing out air.

It should feel like a small explosion at your lips, with clear airflow that you can feel if you hold your hand in front of your mouth while saying it.

When `p` combines with the finals `a, o, i, u`, you get the syllables: `pa, po, pi, pu`.
