<!-- (Audio) A: ong, dong, tong, gong, kong, hong, zhong, chong, shong, rong -->

# --description--

`ong` is a back nasal final. It begins with a sound close to `u`, with the lips rounded, then moves into the back nasal `ng`, made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.

The transition should be smooth and continuous without any break between the parts.

When `ong` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `dong`, `tong`, `gong`, `kong`, `hong`, `cong`, `zhong`, `shong`, and `rong`.
