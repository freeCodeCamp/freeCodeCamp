<!-- (Audio) A: a -->

# --description--

There are six single finals in Pinyin: `a`, `o`, `e`, `i`, `u`, `ü`. Each is a pure vowel sound pronounced with a steady mouth shape.

The first simple final you'll learn is `a`.

To pronounce it, open your mouth wide naturally, keep your jaw relaxed, and place your tongue flat and low in your mouth. Make sure the sound is steady and clear. Do not round your lips or spread them too much. Practice by holding the sound for two seconds: `a——`.
