<!-- (Audio) A: b, ba, bo, bi, bu -->

# --description--

You know a Pinyin syllable has three parts: initial, final, and tone. You have already learned the finals and practiced tones. Now you focus on initials.

There are 23 initials in total. You'll learn them in groups by mouth position to make pronunciation easier. The first group is `b`, `p`, `m`, `f`.

The very first initial you learn here is `b`. To pronounce the `b`, gently press your lips together and then release them while making a short, soft sound without a strong puff of air and without vibration in your vocal cords. It should feel quick and smooth, as your lips come together and part gently.

When `b` is combined with the finals `a`, `o`, `i`, `u`, you get the syllables: `ba`, `bo`, `bi`, `bu`.
