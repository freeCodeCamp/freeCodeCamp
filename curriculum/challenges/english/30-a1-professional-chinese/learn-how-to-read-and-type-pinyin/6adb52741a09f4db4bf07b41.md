<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: d, da, de, di, du -->

# --description--

Now you'll learn another group of initials: `d`, `t`, `n` and `l`.

To pronounce `d`, place the tip of your tongue lightly against the bumpy ridge right behind your upper front teeth. Release it quickly and cleanly. There should be no vibration in your throat and no strong puff of air after the sound. Keep it short and crisp.

When `d` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, `i`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `da`, `de`, `di`, and `du`.
