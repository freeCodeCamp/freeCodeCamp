<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uen, lun, dun, tun, gun, kun, hun -->

# --description--

`uen` is a smooth, connected sound. To pronounce it, you begin with a rounded `u`, then pass quickly through a light `e` sound, and finish with the front nasal `n` by lightly touching the tongue tip behind your upper front teeth.

In spelling, `uen` is usually written as `un`.

When `uen` is combined with initials, you can form syllables like `lun`, `dun`, `tun`, `gun`, `kun`, and `hun`.
