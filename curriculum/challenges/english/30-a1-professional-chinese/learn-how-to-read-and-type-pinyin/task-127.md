<!-- (Audio) A: ing, bing, ping, ming, ding, ning, ling -->

# --description--

`ing` is a back nasal final.  

It begins with the high front vowel `i`, made with the tongue close to the roof of the mouth and the lips spread. Then it moves directly into the back nasal `ng`, produced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

This makes `ing` different from `in`, which ends with the front nasal `n`. In `ing`, the nasal sound resonates at the back of the mouth, giving it a deeper quality.  

When `ing` is combined with initials, you get syllables such as `bing`, `ping`, `ming`, `ding`, `ning`, and `ling`.
