<!-- (Audio) A: t, ta, te, ti, tu -->

# --description--

The initial `t` sound is made by pressing the tip of your tongue firmly against the ridge behind your upper front teeth, then releasing it with a strong burst of air.

Unlike the softer `d` sound which is made the same way but without the puff of air, `t` should produce a noticeable rush of air when you say it, like a quick, sharp exhale. Keep your throat relaxed without vibration and focus on making the air explosion clear. You can test it by holding your hand in front of your mouth to make sure you feel a strong puff.

when `t` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, `i`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ta`, `te`, `ti`, and `tu`.
