<!-- (Audio) A: uang -->

# --description--

`uang` combines the rounded vowel `u` with the back nasal final `ang`.  

It starts with `u`, made with rounded lips, then opens into `a`, and finishes with the back nasal `ng`, formed by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `uang`.
