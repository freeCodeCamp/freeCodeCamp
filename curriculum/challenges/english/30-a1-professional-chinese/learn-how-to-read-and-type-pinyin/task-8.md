# --description--

`端` is the sixth of the six simple finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce `端`, round your lips tightly, as if you're about to whistle. The tongue is positioned high in the front of the mouth, similar to `i`, but with rounded lips. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.
