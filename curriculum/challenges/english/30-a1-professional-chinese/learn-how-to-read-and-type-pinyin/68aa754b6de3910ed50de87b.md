<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: yu, ye, yue, yuan, yin, yun, ying -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, some syllables are learned as single units rather than being broken into initials and finals. These are called whole syllables.

You've already learned several of them, including `zhi`, `chi`, `shi`, `ri`, `zi`, `ci`, `si`, `yi`, and `wu`.

Now you'll focus on the important set that begins with `y`: `yu`, `ye`, `yue`, `yuan`, `yin`, `yun`, and `ying`.

Remember you should read these as single units rather than trying to separate them into parts.
