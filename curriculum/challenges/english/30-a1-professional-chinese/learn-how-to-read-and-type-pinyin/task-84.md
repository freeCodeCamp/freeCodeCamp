<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ue, jue, que, xue -->

# --description--

`ue` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`. Then, without breaking the sound, relax the tongue and lower the jaw slightly into the position for `e`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ue` is combined with the initials, you get the syllables like `jue`, `que`, `xue`.
