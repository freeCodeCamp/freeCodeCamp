<!-- (Audio) A: zhi, chi, shi, ri -->

In Pinyin, 16 syllables are regarded as single units rather than being broken into initials and finals. These are called **whole syllables**.

They are `zhi`, `chi`, `shi`, `ri`, `zi`, `ci`, `si`, `yi`, `wu`, `yu`, `ye`, `yue`, `yuan`, `yin`, `yun`, and `ying`. You've already seen some of them in previous lessons.

Here you'll learn `zhi`, `chi`, `shi`, `ri`. In these syllables, `i` does notï¿½?represent the standard vowel sound. Instead, it represents a unique vocal extension specific to the consonants `zh`, `ch`, `sh` and `r`.
