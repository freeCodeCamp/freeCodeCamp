<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: iong, jiong, qiong, xiong -->

# --description--

`iong` combines the high front vowel `i` with the back nasal final `ong`.  

It starts with `i`, where the tongue is high and the lips spread, then quickly moves into a rounded vowel similar to `u`, and ends with the back nasal `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

For tone marking, the mark goes on `o` in `iong`.
