<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: c, ca, ce, ci, cu -->

# --description--

The initial `c` is pronounced by placing the tip of your tongue against the back of your upper front teeth. It's similar to the English "ts" sound in "cats" but with more aspiration.

When `c` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, `i`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ca`, `ce`, `ci`, and `cu`.
