<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: a -->

# --description--

There are six simple finals in Pinyin: `a`, `o`, `e`, `i`, `u`, `Ã¼`. Each is a pure vowel sound pronounced with a steady mouth shape.

The first single final you'll learn is `a`.

To pronounce `a`, open your mouth wide naturally, keep your jaw relaxed, and the tongue lies flat and low in the mouth. Make sure the sound is steady and clear. Do not round your lips or spread them too much.

[ ] pronouncing `a`

# --assignment--
