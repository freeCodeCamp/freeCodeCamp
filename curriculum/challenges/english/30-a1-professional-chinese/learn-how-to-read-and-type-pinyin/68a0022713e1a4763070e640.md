<!-- (Audio) A: iou -->

# --description--

`iou` can be thought of as `i` + `ou`. Start with the tongue high and close to the roof of the mouth for `i`. Then round the lips for `o`. Finally, bring the lips closer for `u`.

In natural speech, the middle `o` is often very subtle. Focus on making a smooth glide from `i` to `u`, without a break.

`iou` is usually written as `iu` in Pinyin spelling. For tone marking, when `i` and `u` appear together, the rule says the mark is written on the second one. So in `iu`, the tone mark goes on `u`, such as `i√π`.
