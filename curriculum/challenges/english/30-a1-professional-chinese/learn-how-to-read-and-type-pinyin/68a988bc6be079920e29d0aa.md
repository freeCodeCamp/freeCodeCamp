<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: sh, shi, shu -->

# --description--

The initial `sh` is pronounced by curling the tip of your tongue up and back toward the roof of your mouth, creating a narrow gap for air to flow through continuously, resulting in a soft but deep friction sound. The main difference between `sh` and the earlier learned `s` lies in the tongue shape: while `s` uses a flat tongue placed close to the back of the upper teeth, `sh` requires the tongue to curl backward, producing a distinctly deeper and softer sound.

When `sh` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `shi` and `shu`.

Remember that the `i` in `shi` is not pronounced as a regular vowel; instead, it simply extends the `sh` sound with a subtle buzzing tone, requiring no change in tongue position.
