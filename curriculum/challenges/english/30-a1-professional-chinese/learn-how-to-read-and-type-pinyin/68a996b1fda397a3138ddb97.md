<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: r, ri, ru -->

# --description--

The initial `r` is pronounced by curling the tip of your tongue up and back toward the roof of your mouth, similar to the position for `sh`, but with one key difference: your vocal cords should vibrate, creating a soft, buzzing sound.  You should feel a hum in your throat while pronouncing it.

When `r` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `ri` and `ru`.

Note that the `i` in `ri` is not a separate vowel; it simply extends the `r` sound with the same buzzing quality.
