<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: p, pa, po, pi, pu --> 

# --description--

To pronounce the initial `p`, firmly press your lips together and then release them with a quick, strong burst of air. This puff of air is what makes `p` different from `b`, which uses the same lip position but releases the sound gently without pushing out air.

It should feel like a small explosion at your lips, with clear airflow that you can feel if you hold your hand in front of your mouth while saying it.

When `p` combines with the finals `a`, `o`, `i`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `pa`, `po`, `pi`, and `pu`.

Similar to `b`, when pronouncing these syllables, smoothly link the `p` sound directly into the vowel sound without pausing between them. The only difference will be the mouth shape you make for each specific vowel.
