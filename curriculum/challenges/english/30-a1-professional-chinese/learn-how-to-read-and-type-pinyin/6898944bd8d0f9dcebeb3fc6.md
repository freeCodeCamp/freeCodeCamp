<!-- (Audio) A: i -->

# --description--

`i` is the fourth of the six single finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce it, keep your lips ​naturally spread and flat, similar to a slight smile. ​Press the tip of your tongue gently against the back of your lower teeth.​​ ​Raise the front of your tongue close to the hard palate​ ​without touching it. Keep the sound steady and clear for two seconds: `i——`.
