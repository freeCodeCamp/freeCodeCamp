## Finals in Pinyin

In Pinyin, the final is the part of a syllable that comes after the initial. Every syllable must have a final, even if it does not have an initial.

It is usually a more open sound that can be made without closing the mouth completely. 

Click the audio to hear each sound.

### Simple Finals

These are single, basic sounds.

a <!-- audio: a -->  
o <!-- audio: o -->  
e <!-- audio: e -->  
i <!-- audio: i -->  
u <!-- audio: u -->  
ü <!-- audio: ü -->  

### Compound Finals

These are combinations of simple finals, read smoothly as one sound without pausing between the parts.

ai <!-- audio: ai -->  
ei <!-- audio: ei -->  
ao <!-- audio: ao -->  
ou <!-- audio: ou -->  
ia <!-- audio: ia -->  
ie <!-- audio: ie -->  
ua <!-- audio: ua -->  
uo <!-- audio: uo -->  
üe <!-- audio: üe -->  
iao <!-- audio: iao -->  
iou (written as iu) <!-- audio: iou -->  
uai <!-- audio: uai -->  
uei (written as ui) <!-- audio: uei -->  

### Nasal Finals with -n Ending

These finals end with the sound `n` which changes the tone quality of the final.

an <!-- audio: an -->  
en <!-- audio: en -->  
ian <!-- audio: ian -->  
uan <!-- audio: uan -->  
üan <!-- audio: üan -->  

### Nasal Finals with `-ng` Ending

These finals end with the sound `ng` which is longer and deeper than `n`.

ang <!-- audio: ang -->  
eng <!-- audio: eng -->  
ing <!-- audio: ing -->  
ong <!-- audio: ong -->  
iong <!-- audio: iong -->
