<!-- (Audio) A: ā -->

# --description--

For simple finals like `a`, the tone mark goes directly on the vowel. For example, `ā` (first tone).

As a reminder, in this curriculum, you can type the tone number after the Pinyin, and the tone mark will be added automatically.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the final with the correct tone mark.

# --fillInTheBlank--
