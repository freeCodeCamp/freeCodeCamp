<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ia, jia, qia, xia, lia -->

# --description--

`ia` starts with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `i`. Then, without breaking the sound, open the mouth wider into the position for `a`.

The first part is narrow and high, while the second part opens more.

When `ia` is combined with the initials `j`, `q`, `x`, `l`, you get the syllables: `jia`, `qia`, `xia`, `lia`.
