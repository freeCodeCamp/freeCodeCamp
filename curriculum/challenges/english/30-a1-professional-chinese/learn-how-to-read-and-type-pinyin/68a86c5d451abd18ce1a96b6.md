<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: h, ha, he, hu -->

# --description--

The initial `h` is pronounced by raising the back of your tongue close to the soft palate, creating a narrow opening. Gently exhale a steady stream of air through this space, allowing it to create a soft sound, similar to a light, breathy sigh from the throat.

When `h` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ha`, `he`, and `hu`.
