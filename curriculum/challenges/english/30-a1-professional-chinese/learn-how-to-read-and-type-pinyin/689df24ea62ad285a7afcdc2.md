<!-- (Audio) A: ü -->

# --description--

`ü` is the last one of the six single finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce `ü`, push the tip of your tongue gently against your lower front teeth while tightly rounding your lips (similar to saying `u`, but with a more forward tongue position).

Since there's no key on most keyboards for `ü`, you can type it as `v` in most input methods.

This is the sixth single final in Pinyin, pronounced with the tongue tip against the lower front teeth and the lips rounded and small.
