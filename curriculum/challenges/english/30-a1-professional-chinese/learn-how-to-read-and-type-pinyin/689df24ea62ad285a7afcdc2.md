<!-- (Audio) A: ü -->

# --description--

`ü` is the last one of the six single finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce it, push the tip of your tongue gently against your lower front teeth while tightly rounding your lips (similar to saying `u`, but with a more forward tongue position). Practice by holding it for two seconds: `ü——`.
