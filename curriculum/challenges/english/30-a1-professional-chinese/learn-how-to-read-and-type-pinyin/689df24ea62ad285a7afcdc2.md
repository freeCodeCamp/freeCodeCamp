<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ü -->

# --description--

`ü` is the last one of the six simple finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce `ü`, push the tip of your tongue gently against your lower front teeth while tightly rounding your lips (similar to saying `u`, but with a more forward tongue position).

Since there's no key on most keyboards for `ü`, you can type it as `v` in most input methods.

[ ] pronouncing `ü`

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final.
