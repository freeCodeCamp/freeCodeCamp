<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ei, bei, pei, mei, fei, dei, tei, nei, lei -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`ei` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `e` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `e` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `i` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ei` is combined with the initials `b`, `p`, `m`, `f`, `d`, `t`, `n`, `l`, you get the syllables: `bei`, `pei`, `mei`, `fei`, `dei`, `tei`, `nei`, `lei`.
