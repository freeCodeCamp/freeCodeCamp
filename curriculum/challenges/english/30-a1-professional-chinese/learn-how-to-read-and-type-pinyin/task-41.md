<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: h, ha, he, hu -->

# --description--

The initial `h` is pronounced by exhaling air through your throat, creating a soft friction sound. It's similar to the English "h" sound in "hello" or "house".

When `h` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ha`, `he`, and `hu`.
