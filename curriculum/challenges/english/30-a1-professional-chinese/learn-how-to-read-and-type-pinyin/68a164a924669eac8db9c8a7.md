<!-- (Audio) A: iang -->

# --description--

`iang` combines the high vowel `i` with the back nasal final `ang`.  

It starts with `i`, where the tongue is high and the lips are spread, then quickly opens into `a` before finishing with the back nasal `ng`, made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

For tone marking, the mark goes on `a` in `iang`.
