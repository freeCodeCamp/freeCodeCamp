<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uo -->

# --description--

`uo` starts with rounded lips and the tongue high in the back of the mouth for `u`. Then, without a break, relax the lips slightly and move the tongue forward for `o`.

Keep the flow steady so the two parts connect naturally.

[ ] pronouncing `uo`

# --assignment--
