<!-- (Audio) A: bà -->

# --description--

Remember there are four main tones in Pinyin: first tone (high and flat), second tone (rising), third tone (dipping), and fourth tone (falling). Each tone changes the meaning of the syllable.

The tone mark should always be placed on the final, not the initial.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the syllable with the correct tone mark.
