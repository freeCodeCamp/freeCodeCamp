<!-- (Audio) A: ou, mou, fou, dou, kou, zou, shou -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`ou` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the mouth in the position for the `o` sound, then smoothly transition the tongue and lips toward the position for `u`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the two sounds. The `o` is emphasized slightly longer, while the `u` is shorter and lighter, resulting in a natural glide rather than two separate vowels.

When `ou` is combined with the initials `m`, `f`, `d`, `k`, `z`, `sh`, you get the syllables: `mou`, `fou`, `dou`, `kou`, `zou`, `shou`.
