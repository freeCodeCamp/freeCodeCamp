<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uan, duan, tuan, guan, kuan, huan -->

# --description--

`uan` is a smooth blend that starts with the rounded vowel `u` and ends with the nasal `n` sound.

Begin by rounding your lips tightly to pronounce `u`, then quickly open your mouth slightly to produce a short vowel like `a`, and finish with the nasal `n` sound by gently touching the tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

Although the spelling is `u-a-n`, the middle `a` is very short and light. It should feel like one connected syllable, not three separate parts.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `duan`, `tuan`, `guan`, `kuan`, and `huan`.
