<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: g, ga, ge, gu -->

# --description--

The initial `g` is pronounced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate. Unlike `k`, `g` is unaspirated. When you release it, there is no puff of air.

To practice, try saying `g` and you should feel almost no air hit your hand if you hold it in front of your mouth. Then, try the same with `k` and you should feel a strong puff of air. 

When `g` combines with the finals `a`, `e`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `ga`, `ge`, and `gu`.
