<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: zh, zhi, zhu -->

# --description--

The initial `zh` is pronounced by curling the tip of your tongue upward until it approaches (but doesn't touch) the roof of your mouth. Release the airflow smoothly to create a soft but distinct sound. This curled-tongue position is what distinguishes `zh` from the `z`.

When `zh` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `zhi` and `zhu`.

Note that the `i` in `zhi` is not the regular `i` sound. Instead, simply extend the `zh` sound with a soft buzz. Keep your tongue curled and let the sound vibrate gently.
