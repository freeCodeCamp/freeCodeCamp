<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: in, bin, pin, min, nin, lin -->

# --description--

The nasal final `in` is a front nasal ending with the `n` sound, like `an` and `en`.

To pronounce `in`, start with the vowel `i`, where the tongue is high and close to the roof of the mouth. Then move into the nasal `n` sound by touching the tongue tip behind your top teeth.

When combined with the initials, you can form syllables like `bin`, `pin`, `min`, `nin`, and `lin`.
