## Typing Pinyin on Your Device

Before you start practicing Pinyin, let's make sure you know how to type it on your device.

## Step 1: Enable a Chinese Input Method

**On Windows**

- Go to Settings → Time & Language → Language.
- Click Add a language and choose Chinese (Simplified).
- Under options, make sure Microsoft Pinyin is installed.

**On macOS**

- Open System Settings → Keyboard → Input Sources.
- Click `+` and choose Chinese, Simplified – Pinyin.

**On Android**

- Go to Settings → System → Languages & input.
- Add Chinese (Simplified) and select a Pinyin keyboard.

**On iOS (iPhone/iPad)**

- Open Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards.
- Tap Add New Keyboard and choose Chinese (Simplified) – Pinyin.

**On Linux (Ubuntu example)**

- Open Settings → Region & Language.
- Click `+` to add an input source and select Chinese (Pinyin).
- Choose an input method such as IBus Pinyin or Fcitx Pinyin.
- Switch to the Pinyin input method to type in Chinese.

## Step 2: Typing Words in Pinyin

- Type the Pinyin letters for the word.
- Your device will show a list of Chinese characters that match.
- Example: Type `nihao` and choose `你好`.

## Step 3: Adding Tone Marks

Most built-in input methods do not support adding tone marks by typing numbers.

In this curriculum, you can type the tone number after the Pinyin, and the tone mark will be added automatically.

| Input        | Output  |
|--------------|---------|
| ma1          | mā      |
| ma2          | má      |
| ma3          | mǎ      |
| ma4          | mà      |
| ma (no number) | ma (neutral tone) |
