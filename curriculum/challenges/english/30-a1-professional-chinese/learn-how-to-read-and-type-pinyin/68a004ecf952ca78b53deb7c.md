<!-- (Audio) A: uai -->

# --description--

`uai` can be thought of as `ua` + `i`. It begins with rounded lips for `u`. Then the mouth opens wide for `a`. Finally, the tongue moves forward and close to the roof of the mouth for `i`.

Compared to `ai`, which has only two parts, `uai` adds the rounded beginning before moving into the `ai` sound.

Because this final contains `a`, the tone mark always falls on `a`. For example, `u√°i`.
