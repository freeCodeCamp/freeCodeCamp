<!-- (Audio) A: f, fa, fo, fu -->

# --description--

`f` is a sound made with your lips and teeth. To pronounce the `f`, gently place your upper teeth against your lower lip and let air flow smoothly between them.

Unlike `b` and `p` where your lips press together completely, for `f` your lips never fully close as you make this soft, continuous sound by steadily exhaling through the small space between your teeth and lower lip.

When `f` combines with the finals `a`, `o`, and `u`, you get the syllables: `fa`, `fo`, and `fu`.
