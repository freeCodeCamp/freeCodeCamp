## What Is Pinyin?

Pinyin is the Romanized system used to represent the sounds of Chinese characters. Each pinyin syllable includes:

- An initial (optional)  
- A final (required)  
- A tone (always required)

## Syllable Structure

A Chinese syllable = Initial + Final + Tone

Examples:

| Syllable | Initial | Final | Tone |
|----------|---------|-------|------|
| mā       | m       | a     | First |
| hǎo      | h       | ao    | Third |
| ài       | (none)  | ai    | Fourth |
