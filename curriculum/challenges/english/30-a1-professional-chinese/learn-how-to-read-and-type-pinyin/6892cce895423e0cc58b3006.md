## What Is Pinyin?

Pinyin is the Romanized spelling system for the sounds of Chinese. It uses the Latin alphabet to write how Chinese characters are pronounced.

Pinyin does not change the meaning of a character. It only shows you how to pronounce it.

The Pinyin you learn in this curriculum will apply specifically to Mandarin. Other varieties of Chinese, like Cantonese, have different pronunciation systems.

## Why Learn Pinyin First

- You can read and type Chinese without knowing any Chinese characters yet.
- You can pronounce Chinese correctly from the beginning.  
- You can look up Chinese in dictionaries and apps using Pinyin.

Learning Pinyin first makes it much easier for you to start speaking and reading Chinese.

In this first block you will learn initials, finals, tones, syllable structure and the basic tone mark rule for writing.

In later blocks, as you learn Chinese characters, you will learn more advanced Pinyin knowledge like tone sandhi.

## Pinyin Syllable Structure

A syllable is a single unit of pronunciation. In Pinyin, one syllable matches one Chinese character.

Every Pinyin syllable is made of three parts, which work together like building blocks to make the complete sound.

**Initial**
The first part of the syllable, usually a consonant. For example: in `ma`, the initial is `m`.

**Final**
The part after the initial. Usually a vowel, and sometimes a combination of vowels and ending consonants. For example: in `ma`, the final is `a`.

Some syllables have no initial. For example: in `ai`, there is no initial, it starts directly with the final.

**Tone**
The pitch pattern of the syllable. Chinese has four main tones plus a light, unstressed tone called the neutral tone.

| Tone | Pitch Shape  |Example |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 1st (flat)     | ¯  | mā(audio) |
| 2nd (rising)         | ˊ     | má(audio) |
| 3rd (falling-rising) | ˇ    | mǎ(audio) |
| 4th (falling)        | ˋ     | mà(audio) |
| Neutral              | (no mark) | ma(audio) |

Tones change the meaning of a character, even if the initial and final stay the same. For example: `ma` with the first tone means mother, while `ma` with the third tone means horse.
