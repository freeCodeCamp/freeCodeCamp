<!-- (Audio) A: uei, dui, tui, gui, kui, zhui, shui -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`uei` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`, then smoothly transition to the position for `e`, and finally to the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `uei` is combined with the initials `d`, `t`, `g`, `k`, `zh`, `sh`, you get the syllables: `dui`, `tui`, `gui`, `kui`, `zhui`, `shui`.
