<!-- (Audio) A: er -->

# --description--

`​er`�?is often classified as a ​special final.

To pronounce `er`, you begin by producing the sound of the simple final `e`. While sustaining this vowel, gently raise the tip of your tongue, curl it slightly backward, and then release the tension quickly.

For now, just remember that `er` is a standalone syllable. Later, you will learn how it attaches to other syllables as a suffix.
