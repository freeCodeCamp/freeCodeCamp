<!-- (Audio) A: uai, kuai, guai, huai, shuai, zhuai -->

# --description--

In Pinyin, there are fourteen compound finals.

A compound final consists of two or three vowel sounds that blend smoothly together within a single syllable, creating a gliding sound without interruption.

`uai` is one of them. To pronounce it, you begin with the tongue high and close to the hard palate for `u`, then smoothly transition to the position for `a`, and finally to the position for `i`. The movement should be fluid, with no break between the three sounds.

When `uai` is combined with the initials `k`, `g`, `h`, `sh`, `zh`, you get the syllables: `kuai`, `guai`, `huai`, `shuai`, `zhuai`.
