<!-- (Audio) A: o -->

# --description--

`o` is the second of the six simple finals in Pinyin.

To pronounce `o`, round your lips gently, keeping them relaxed and not pushed forward. The back of your tongue should be slightly raised, while your jaw remains loose. The sound is produced as a short, clear vowel, without making it long or tense.

[ ] pronouncing `o`

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the final.
