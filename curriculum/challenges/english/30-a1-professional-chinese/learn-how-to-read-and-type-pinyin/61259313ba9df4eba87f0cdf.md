<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: w, wa, wo, wu, wai, wei, wan, weng -->

# --description--

`w` is also a spelling symbol. It's used when `u` is the main vowel sound in a syllable. It helps clarify syllable boundaries and makes syllables easier to read.

- If `u` is used as a syllable, add `w` in front of it: `u` �?`wu`.

- If a syllable starts with `u`, change it to `w`. Examples: `ua` �?`wa`, `uo` �?`wo`, `uai` �?`wai`, `uei` �?`wei`, `uan` �?`wan`, `ueng` �?`weng`.
