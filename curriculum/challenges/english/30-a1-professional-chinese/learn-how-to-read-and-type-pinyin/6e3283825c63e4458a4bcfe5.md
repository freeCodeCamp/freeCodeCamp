<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: y, ya, ye, yi, yao, you, yang, yu -->

# --description--

Sometimes you see `y` and `w` at the start of a syllable. ​They are not real consonants.​�?Think of them as ​special spelling symbols�?that clarify syllable boundaries and make syllables easier to read.

The rules for `y` are:

�? If `i` is used as a syllable, add `y` in front of it: `i` �?`yi`.

- If a syllable starts with `i`, change it to `y`. Examples: `ia` �?`ya`, `ie` �?`​ye`, `iao` �?`yao`, `iou` �?`you`, `iang` �?`yang`.

- If `ü` is used as a syllable, add `y` in front of it and remove the dots: `ü` �?`yu`.
