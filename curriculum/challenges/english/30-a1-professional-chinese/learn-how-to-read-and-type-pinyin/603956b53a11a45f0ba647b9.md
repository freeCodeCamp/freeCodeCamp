<!-- (Audio) A: ueng -->

# --description--

`ueng` is the last nasal final you learn.

It starts with `u`, made with rounded lips, then passes through a very light middle vowel sound, and ends with the back nasal `ng`, produced with the back of the tongue against the soft palate. The transition between all parts should be smooth and continuous.
