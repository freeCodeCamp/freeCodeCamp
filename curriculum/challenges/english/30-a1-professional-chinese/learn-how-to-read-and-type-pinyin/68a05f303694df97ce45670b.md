<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: ün -->

# --description--

The last front nasal final `ün` is made of `ü` plus the nasal `n`. You start with the rounded `ü` vowel, then move directly into the nasal `n` by touching the tongue tip behind your upper teeth.

Unlike `uen`, there is no middle `e` sound here. It's simply a quick connection from `ü` to `n`.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `ü` in `ün`. For example, `ǘn`.
