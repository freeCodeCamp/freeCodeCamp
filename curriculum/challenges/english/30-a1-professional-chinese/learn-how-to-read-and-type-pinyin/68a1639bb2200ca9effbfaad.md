<!-- (Audio) A: eng -->

# --description--

`eng` is a back nasal final, like `ang`, but with a different vowel quality.  

While `ang` starts with the open vowel `a`, `eng` begins with a mid vowel sound. The tongue root is pulled slightly further back than in `ang`, and the lips stay more relaxed.  

It ends with the back nasal `ng`, made by lifting the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

For tone marking, the mark goes on `e` in `eng`.
