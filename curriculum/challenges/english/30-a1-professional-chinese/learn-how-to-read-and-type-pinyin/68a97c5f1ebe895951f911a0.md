<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: z, zi, zu -->

# --description--

The initial `z` is pronounced by placing the tip of your tongue lightly against the back of your upper front teeth, creating a brief blockage of air. Release the tongue smoothly without any strong puff of air. The sound should be short and crisp, without any breathy explosion.  

When `z` combines with the finals `i` and `u`, you get the syllables: `zi` and `zu`.

Note that the `i` in `zi` is not pronounced like a regular `i` sound. Instead, after making the `z` sound, simply prolong the vibration gently without moving your tongue.
