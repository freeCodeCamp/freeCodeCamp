<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: iang, jiang, qiang, xiang, liang, niang -->

# --description--

`iang` combines the high vowel `i` with the back nasal final `ang`.  

It starts with `i`, where the tongue is high and the lips are spread, then quickly opens into `a` before finishing with the back nasal `ng`, made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.  

When `iang` is combined with initials, you can form syllables like `jiang`, `qiang`, `xiang`, `liang`, and `niang`.
