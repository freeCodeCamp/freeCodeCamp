<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: q, qi, qu -->

# --description--

The initial `q` is pronounced in the same way as `j`, by raising the middle of your tongue close to the hard palate, but with one key difference: release it with a strong puff of air. Imagine the gentle `j` sound turning into a crisp, breathy version. 

When `q` combines with the finals `i` and `ü`, you get the syllables: `qi` and `qu`.

Note that when `q` is paired with `ü`, the two dots are also omitted in writing. So `qu` is actually pronounced as `qü`.
