<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: j, ji, ju -->

# --description--

The initial `j` is pronounced by raising the middle of your tongue close to the hard palate, then releasing it softly with no puff of air.  

When `j` combines with the finals `i` and `ü`, you get the syllables: `ji` and `ju`.

Note that when `j` is paired with `ü`, the two dots are omitted in writing. So `ju` is actually pronounced as `jü`.

# --assignment--
