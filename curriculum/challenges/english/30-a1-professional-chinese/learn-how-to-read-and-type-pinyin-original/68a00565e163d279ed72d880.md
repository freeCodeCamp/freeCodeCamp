<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: uei dui, tui, gui, kui, zhui, shui-->

# --description--

`uei` can be thought of as `u` + `ei`. Start with rounded lips for `u`. Then relax the lips slightly and move the tongue forward for `e`. Finally, raise the tongue higher for `i`.

In natural speech, the middle `e` is often very light. Pay more attention to gliding smoothly from `u` into `i`.

`uei` is usually written as `ui` in Pinyin spelling. For tone marking, when `i` and `u` appear together, the rule says the mark is written on the second one. So in `ui`, the tone mark goes on `i`, for example, `u√¨`.
