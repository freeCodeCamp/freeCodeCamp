<!-- (Audio) A: ong -->

# --description--

`ong` is a back nasal final. It begins with a sound close to `u`, with the lips rounded, then moves into the back nasal `ng`, made with the back of the tongue against the soft palate.

The transition should be smooth and continuous without any break between the parts.

For tone marking, the mark goes on `o` in `ong`.

[ ] pronouncing `ong`

# --assignment--
