<!--SPEAKING-->

<!-- (Audio) A: x, xi, xu -->

# --description--

The initial `x` is pronounced similarly to `j`and `q`, by raising the middle of your tongue close to the hard palate, but instead of a stop-and-release, you create a continuous soft friction by gently blowing air through the narrow gap.

When `x` combines with the finals `i` and `ü`, you get the syllables: `xi` and `xu`. Note that when `x` is paired with `ü`, the two dots are also omitted in writing. So `xu` is actually pronounced as `xü`.

[ ] pronouncing `x`  
[ ] pronouncing `xi`  
[ ] pronouncing `xu`

# --assignment--

Listen to the audio and pronounce the initial and syllables.
