## The Neutral Tone

You've already learned the four main tones in Pinyin: First tone (`ˉ`), Second tone (`ˊ`), Third tone (`ˇ`), and Fourth tone (`ˋ`).

Now you'll learn about the fifth tone: the neutral tone.

The neutral tone is marked by no tone mark and is pronounced with a light and short sound.

For example, in `谢谢(xiè xie)`, the first `谢` uses the fourth tone, while the second `谢` uses the neutral tone.

### Examples

| Word | Pinyin | Meaning |
|------|--------|---------|
| `谢谢` | `xiè xie` (audio) | thank you |
| `妈妈` | `mā ma` (audio) | mother |
| `爸爸` | `bà ba` (audio) | father |
| `哥哥` | `gē ge` (audio) | older brother |
