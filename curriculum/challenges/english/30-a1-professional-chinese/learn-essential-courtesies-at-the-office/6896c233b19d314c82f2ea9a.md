<!-- (Audio) B：没关系 -->

# --description--

`没关系(méi guān xi)` has three Pinyin syllables: `méi`, `guān`, and `xi`.

`méi` begins with `m` and ends with `ei`. It uses the second tone. `guān` begins with `g` and ends with `uan`. It uses the first tone. `xi` begins with `x` and ends with `i`. It is pronounced with a neutral tone.

The character `系` is normally pronounced as `xì` (fourth tone), but here it becomes `xi` (neutral tone). It makes the phrase sound more casual and friendly.

This is another example of how the neutral tone helps make phrases flow more naturally.
