<!-- (Audio) A：你好 -->

# --description--

This greeting uses two specific pinyin syllables: `nǐ` and `hǎo`. Both have third tone marks, which sound like a dipping tone.

`nǐ` starts with the consonant `n` and ends with the vowel `ǐ`. `hǎo` starts with `h` and ends with `ǎo`. These tone marks are important for correct pronunciation.
