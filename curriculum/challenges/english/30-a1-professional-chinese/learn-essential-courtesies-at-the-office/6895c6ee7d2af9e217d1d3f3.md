## Pinyin Rule – Tone Sandhi of 不 (bù)

You've just learned `不客气(bù kè qì)`, which means you're welcome.

Maybe you noticed `不(bù)` is written as `bù`, but in the audio it sounds more like `bú`.

(audio)

### Why Does It Sound Like `bú kè qì`?

This is because of a tone change rule in Chinese called **Tone Sandhi Rule for 不**.

If `不(bù)` is followed by another syllable in the fourth tone, it changes to the second tone (`bú`).

This makes the phrase easier to say. Two falling tones in a row (like `bù` + `kè`) are hard to pronounce smoothly, so the first one changes.

### Examples

| Written     | Pronounced As |
|-------------|----------------|
| `bù yào` | `bú yào`(audio)   |
| `bù duì`       | `bú duì` (audio)      |
| `bù jiàn yì` | `bú jiàn yì` (audio) |

But if the next syllable is not in the fourth tone, `不(bù)` stays `bù`:

| Written     | Pronounced As |
|-------------|----------------|
| `bù chī`     | `bù chī` (audio)  |
| `bù hǎo`     | `bù hǎo`  (audio) |
| `bù xíng`     | `bù xíng` (audio)|
