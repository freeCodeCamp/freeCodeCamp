<!-- (Audio) A：谢谢你 -->

# --description--

`谢谢你` is made of three syllables: `xiè`, `xie`, and `nǐ`.

`xiè` begins with the consonant `x` and ends with the vowel `iè`. It uses the fourth tone, which is a sharp falling tone. The second `xie` is neutral, meaning it has no specific tone. `nǐ` uses the third tone, which sounds like a dip.
