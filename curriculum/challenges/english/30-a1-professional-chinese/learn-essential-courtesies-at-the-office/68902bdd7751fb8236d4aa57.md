<!-- (Audio) A: 你好 -->

# --description--

When you combine the two characters `你(nǐ)` and `好(hǎo)`, it becomes `你好(nǐ hǎo)`, which means hello and is used to greet someone politely.

This is the first word you are learning in Chinese. It can be used in almost any situation, such as at work, at school, or when meeting someone for the first time.
