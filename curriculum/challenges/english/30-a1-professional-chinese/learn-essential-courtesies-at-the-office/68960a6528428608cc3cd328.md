<!-- (Audio) A：对不起 -->

# --description--

`对不起(duì bu qǐ)` is made up of three characters: `对(duì)`, `不(bu)`, and `起(qǐ)`. Together, they form a single phrase that means sorry or I'm sorry.

In Chinese, many useful expressions are made of multiple characters but are understood as one unit.

Although `不` is usually pronounced in the fourth tone (`bù`), in this phrase it is often spoken in a neutral tone for smoother pronunciation.
