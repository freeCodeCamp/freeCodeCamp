<!-- (Audio) A：对不起 -->

# --description--

`对不起(duì bu qǐ)` has three Pinyin syllables: `duì`, `bu`, and `qǐ`.

`duì` begins with `d` and ends with `ui`. It uses the fourth tone. `bu` is pronounced in a neutral tone. `qǐ` begins with `q` and ends with `i`. It uses the third tone.

The character `不` is usually pronounced as `bù` (fourth tone), but here it becomes `bu` (neutral tone). It's sandwiched between two stressed syllables, and the neutral tone makes the phrase flow more naturally. This is a common pattern in Pinyin where certain characters change to neutral tone in specific contexts.
