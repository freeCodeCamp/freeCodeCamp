# --description--

You've just learned your first word in Chinese. Let's look at how it sounds when spoken.

(audio)

Why Does It Sound Like `ní hǎo`?

Both `你(nǐ)` and `好(hǎo)` are written in the third tone (`ˇ`). But when you say them together, you don't say two dipping tones. That's hard to pronounce. So Chinese has a rule called:

**Tone Sandhi Rule**: 3rd Tone + 3rd Tone → 2nd Tone + 3rd Tone

When two third-tone syllables appear together, The first syllable becomes second tone (`ˊ`) and the second syllable stays third tone (`ˇ`). You write the original tones, but say them differently.

| Written | Spoken |
|--------|--------|
| nǐ hǎo | ní hǎo |


Here are more examples:

| Written    | Pronounced as |
|------------|----------------|
| měi hǎo    | méi hǎo (audio)       |
| xiǎng fǎ   | xiáng fǎ (audio)      |
| hěn hǎo    | hén hǎo  (audio)      |
| shǒu biǎo  | shóu biǎo (audio)     |
| suǒ yǐ    | suó yǐ  (audio)       |
| kě yǐ      | ké yǐ   (audio)       |
