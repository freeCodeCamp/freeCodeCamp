<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/BpwMZv/' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/BpwMZv/</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can start and stop the board.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can set up the board.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can clear the board.
<strong>User Story:</strong> When I press start, the game will play out.
<strong>User Story:</strong> Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
