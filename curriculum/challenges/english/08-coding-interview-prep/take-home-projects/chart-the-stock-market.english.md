## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>http://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/</a> and deploy it to Heroku.
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <a href='/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects'>https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects</a>.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can remove stocks.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
