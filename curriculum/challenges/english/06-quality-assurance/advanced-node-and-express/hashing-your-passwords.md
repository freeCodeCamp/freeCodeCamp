# --description--

Going back to the information security section, you may remember that storing plaintext passwords is *never* okay. Now it is time to implement BCrypt to solve this issue.

`bcrypt@~5.0.0` has already been added as a dependency, so require it in your server. You will need to handle hashing in 2 key areas: where you handle registering/saving a new account, and when you check to see that a password is correct on login.

Currently on your registration route, you insert a user's plaintext password into the database like so: `password: req.body.password`. Hash the passwords instead by adding the following before your database logic: `const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(req.body.password, 12);`, and replacing the `req.body.password` in the database saving with just `password: hash`.

On your authentication strategy, you check for the following in your code before completing the process: `if (password !== user.password) return done(null, false);`. After making the previous changes, now `user.password` is a hash. Before making a change to the existing code, notice how the statement is checking if the password is **not** equal then return non-authenticated. With this in mind, change that code to look as follows to properly check the password entered against the hash:

```js
if (!bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) { 
  return done(null, false);
}
```

That is all it takes to implement one of the most important security features when you have to store passwords.

# --hints--

BCrypt should be a dependency.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/_api/package.json", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const packJson = await res.json()
  assert.property(
    packJson.dependencies,
    'bcrypt',
    'Your project should list "bcrypt" as a dependency'
  );
}
```

BCrypt should be correctly required and implemented.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/_api/server.js", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  assert.match(
    data,
    /require.*("|')bcrypt\1/gi,
    'You should have required bcrypt'
  );
  assert.match(
    data,
    /bcrypt.hashSync/gi,
    'You should use hash the password in the registration'
  );
  assert.match(
    data,
    /bcrypt.compareSync/gi,
    'You should compare the password to the hash in your strategy'
  );
}
```
