# --description--

As is, any user can just go to `/profile` whether they have authenticated or not by typing in the URL. You want to prevent this by checking if the user is authenticated first before rendering the profile page. This is the perfect example of when to create a middleware.

The challenge here is creating the middleware function `ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next)`, which will check if a user is authenticated by calling Passport's `isAuthenticated` method on the `request` which checks if `req.user` is defined. If it is, then `next()` should be called. Otherwise, you can just respond to the request with a redirect to your homepage to login.

An implementation of this middleware is:

```javascript
function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/');
};
```

Create the above middleware function, then pass `ensureAuthenticated` as middleware to requests for the profile page before the argument to the GET request:

```javascript
app
 .route('/profile')
 .get(ensureAuthenticated, (req,res) => {
    res.render('profile');
 });
```

# --hints--

The middleware `ensureAuthenticated` should be implemented and attached to the `/profile` route.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/_api/server.js", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  assert.match(
    data,
    /ensureAuthenticated[^]*req.isAuthenticated/,
    'Your ensureAuthenticated middleware should be defined and utilize the req.isAuthenticated function'
  );
  assert.match(
    data,
    /profile[^]*get[^]*ensureAuthenticated/,
    'Your ensureAuthenticated middleware should be attached to the /profile route'
  );
}
```

An unauthenticated GET request to `/profile` should correctly redirect to `/`.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/profile", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  assert.match(
    data,
    /Home page/,
    'An attempt to go to the profile at this point should redirect to the homepage since we are not logged in'
  );
}
```
