# --description--

It's time you start allowing clients to send a chat message to the server to emit to all the clients! In your `client.js` file, you should see there is already a block of code handling when the message form is submitted.

```js
$('form').submit(function() {
  /*logic*/
});
```

Within the form submit code, you should emit an event after you define `messageToSend` but before you clear the text box `#m`. The event should be named `'chat message'` and the data should just be `messageToSend`.

```js
socket.emit('chat message', messageToSend);
```

Now, on your server, you should be listening to the socket for the event `'chat message'` with the data being named `message`. Once the event is received, it should emit the event `'chat message'` to all sockets using `io.emit`, sending a data object containing the `username` and `message`.

In `client.js`, you should now listen for event `'chat message'` and, when received, append a list item to `#messages` with the username, a colon, and the message!

At this point, the chat should be fully functional and sending messages across all clients!

# --hints--

Server should listen for `'chat message'` and then emit it properly.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/_api/server.js", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  assert.match(
    data,
    /socket.on.*('|")chat message('|")[^]*io.emit.*('|")chat message('|").*username.*message/s,
    'Your server should listen to the socket for "chat message" then emit to all users "chat message" with name and message in the data object'
  );
}
```

Client should properly handle and display the new data from event `'chat message'`.

```js
async () => {
  const url = new URL("/public/client.js", code);
  const res = await fetch(url);
  const data = await res.text();
  assert.match(
    data,
    /socket.on.*('|")chat message('|")[^]*messages.*li/s,
    'You should append a list item to #messages on your client within the "chat message" event listener to display the new message'
  );
}
```
