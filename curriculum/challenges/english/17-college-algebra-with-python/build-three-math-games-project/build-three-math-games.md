For this challenge, you need to create three math games using Python that do the following:

- Scatter plot game
  - Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates
  - For added difficulty, make the graph larger
- Algebra practice game
  - Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values and the player has to input the answer
  - Use positive and negative values. For added difficulty, make the numbers larger
- Projectile game
  - Display a "wall" with random height and location. Player has to move sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall
  - For added difficulty, make a second level where players enter a, b, and c without sliders

Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
