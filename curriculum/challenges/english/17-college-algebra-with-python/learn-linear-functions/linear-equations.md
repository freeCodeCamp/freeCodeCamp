# --description--

This video will show you the math behind finding the y-intercept in a linear function, so you can develop the whole equation. Then the video will show you how to graph the whole function. You will also see how to do the whole process with Python code.

Here is the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UJ1w-XFTuCfK6FI3H2GT0lbxd2HO3tQ6?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Colab notebook to go with the last two videos,</a> so you can see the formulas.

# --assignment--

Add code to your algebra Colab notebook to graph a function from points or from equation input.

# --questions--

## --text--

If you know the slope ("m") and you have one (x,y) coordinate point, which of the following equations could you use to find "b", representing the y-intercept in Python?

## --answers--

`y = mx +b`

---

`b = y - m*x`

---

`ax + by = c`

---

`(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)=m`
