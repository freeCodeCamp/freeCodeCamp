# --description--

Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three units, and blue tiles measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five units in length in exactly fifteen different ways.

How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled? NOTE: This is related to Problem 116.

# --hints--

`euler117()` should return 100808458960497.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler117(), 100808458960497);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler117() {

  return true;
}

euler117();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
