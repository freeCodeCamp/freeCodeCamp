## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/Em-Ant/full/QbRyqq/' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I am presented with a random series of button presses.
<strong>User Story:</strong> Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button.
<strong>User Story:</strong> If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
<strong>User Story:</strong> If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
<strong>Hint:</strong> Here are mp3s you can use for each button: <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound1.mp3</code>, <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound2.mp3</code>, <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound3.mp3</code>, <code>https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/simonSound4.mp3</code>.
