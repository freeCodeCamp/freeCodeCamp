**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JqdoMV>.

Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see a list of the most recent posts on the freeCodeCamp forum.

**User Story:** For each topic, I can see the title and a list of links to users who have recently posted in it.

**User Story:** I can see the number of replies and views that each topic has had, and a timestamp of when the topic was last active.

**Hint:** To get the 30 most recent forum posts: <https://forum-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/latest>.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
