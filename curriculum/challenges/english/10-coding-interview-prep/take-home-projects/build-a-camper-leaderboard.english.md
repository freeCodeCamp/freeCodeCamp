<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JqdoMV' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JqdoMV</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see a list of the most recent posts on the freeCodeCamp forum.
<strong>User Story:</strong> For each topic, I can see the title and a list of links to users who have recently posted in it.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see the number of replies and views that each topic has had, and a timestamp of when the topic was last active.
<strong>Hint:</strong> To get the 30 most recent forum posts: <a href='https://fcc-forum-proxy.freecodecamp.repl.co/latest' target='_blank'>https://fcc-forum-proxy.freecodecamp.repl.co/latest</a>.
When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
