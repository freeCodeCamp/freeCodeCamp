# --description--

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/XWEONRz>.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can see a Force-directed Graph that shows which countries share borders.

**User Story:** I can see each country's flag on its node.

**Hint:** Here's a dataset you can use to build this: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DealPete/forceDirected/master/countries.json>

**Hint:** You can create a spritesheet of national flags at <https://www.flag-sprites.com>.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
