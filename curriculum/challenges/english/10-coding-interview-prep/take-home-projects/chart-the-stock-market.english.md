## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>https://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/</a>.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can remove stocks.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href='https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
