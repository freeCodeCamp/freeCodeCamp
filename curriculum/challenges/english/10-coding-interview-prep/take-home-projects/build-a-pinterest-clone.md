# --description--

**Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://build-a-pinterest-clone.freecodecamp.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://build-a-pinterest-clone.freecodecamp.rocks/</a>.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can link to images.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)

**Hint:** Masonry.js is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
