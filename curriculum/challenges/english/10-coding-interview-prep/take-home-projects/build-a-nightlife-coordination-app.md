# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/</a>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, you can view all bars in your area.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can add yourself to a bar to indicate you are going there tonight.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can remove yourself from a bar if you no longer want to go there.

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, when you login you should not have to search again.

**Hint:** Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
