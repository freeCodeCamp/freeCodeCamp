# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK de Medellín, Colombia.`

## --blanks--

`Soy`

### --feedback--

Choose between `soy` and `estoy`. The correct verb is used to talk about origin or where someone is from.

# --explanation--

In Spanish, both `ser` and `estar` translate to "to be", but they are used in different contexts.

`Ser` is used for permanent characteristics, origin, nationalities, and professions. 

`Estoy` is used for temporary states, locations, feelings, and conditions.

In the sentence `Soy de Medellín, Colombia.`, `soy` is used because it describes the speaker's origin, which is a permanent characteristic.
