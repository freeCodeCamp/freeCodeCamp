Fill in the blank with the correct verb: `soy` or `estoy`.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`BLANK ingeniero senior de software.`

## --blanks--

`Soy`

### --feedback--

Choose between `soy` and `estoy`. The correct verb is used to talk about permanent characteristics or professions.

# --explanation--

Both `ser` (to be) and `estar` (to be) translate to "to be" in English, but they are used in different contexts.

`Ser` is used for permanent characteristics, professions, nationalities, and origins. Think of it as describing what something is.

`Estoy` (from the verb `estar`) is used for temporary states, locations, feelings, and conditions. Think of it as describing how something is at the moment.

In the sentence `Soy ingeniero senior de software`, `soy` is used because being a "senior software engineer" is a profession.
