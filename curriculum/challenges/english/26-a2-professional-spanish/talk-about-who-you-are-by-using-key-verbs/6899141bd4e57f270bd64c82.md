# --explanation--

The verb `estar` (conjugated as `estoy`) is used to describe a temporary location or position, such as where someone is physically at the moment. 

The verb `ser` (conjugated as `soy`) is used for permanent characteristics, such as a person's identity, profession, or origin. 

The sentence `Soy en la sala de reuniones` is incorrect because being in a meeting room is a temporary state, not a permanent one. The verb `estoy` should be used instead.

The correct sentence would be `Estoy en la sala de reuniones`.
