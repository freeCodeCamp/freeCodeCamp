# --explanation--

`Soy` is used for permanent characteristics or personality traits. 

`No soy tímida` means "I am not shy", indicating that being shy is not a part of her personality. 

The person that this sentence is referring to is female because the adjectives `tímida` and `concentrada` are in their feminine forms.

In contrast, `estoy` is used for temporary states or conditions. 

`Estoy concentrada` means "I am focused", which is a temporary state while she is working.
