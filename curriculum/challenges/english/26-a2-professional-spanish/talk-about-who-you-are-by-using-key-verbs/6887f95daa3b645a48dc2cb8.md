# --explanation--

`No soy tímida` means "I am not shy".

`Solo estoy concentrada cuando trabajo` provides the reason why Luna is not shy. It translates to "I am just focused when I work".

Therefore, Luna's focused state during work can be mistaken for shyness, even though it's not her true personality.
