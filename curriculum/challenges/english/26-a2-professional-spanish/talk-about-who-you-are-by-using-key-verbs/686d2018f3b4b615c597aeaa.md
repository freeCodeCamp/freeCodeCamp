# --explanation--

`Ser` is used for permanent or inherent qualities, identities, professions, and origins. For example:

- `Soy alta.` - I am tall.
- `Soy m√©dico.` - I am a doctor.

`Estar` is used for temporary states, conditions, emotions, and locations. For example:

- `Estoy cansado.` - I am tired.
- `Estoy en casa.` - I am at home.

`Concentrado` ("focused" in masculine form) describes a temporary mental state. Therefore, `estar` is the correct verb to use, in the form of `estoy`.
