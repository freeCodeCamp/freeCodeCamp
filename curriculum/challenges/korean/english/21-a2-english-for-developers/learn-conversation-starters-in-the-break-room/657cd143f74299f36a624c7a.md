# --description--

You learned that `do` is an auxiliary verb that helps ask questions. You have also learned that when you want to ask about something specific, you can use the question word `what.` 

When you want to ask about someone's job or role, you use `what` with `do` to form a question.

For example, you ask `What do you do?` to mean `What is your job?` 

When talking about another person like Maria, you say `What does she do?` because `she` is a third person singular (she, he, it), and with these subjects, `do` changes to `does`.
