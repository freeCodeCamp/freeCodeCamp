<!-- (audio) Tom: Cool! I want to hear you play some day.
Sophie: Only if you show me your favorite pics.
Tom: It's a deal! -->

# --description--

The expression `only if` is used to set a condition for something to happen. It’s like saying `this will happen if that happens.` It's a way of making an agreement where one action depends on another.

For example: if your friend says, `I'll go out only if it doesn't rain,` it means they will go out but the weather must be good - no rain.
