<!-- (Audio) Tom: Don't worry. Debugging is a common challenge for many programmers. How much code are you working on? Sarah: Well, it's actually a lot of code, but the issue is in a specific function. I have a loop inside it. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

How does Sarah respond to Tom's question about the amount of code she's working on and the specific problem she is facing?

## --answers--

She says she isn't working on much code at all.

### --feedback--

This option is incorrect. Sarah actually indicates that she is working on a lot of code.

---

She mentions that she has finished working on the code.

### --feedback--

Sarah does not indicate completion; she is still addressing an issue within the code.

---

She explains that it's a lot of code, and she has identified a problem in a specific function.

---

She requests Tom to help her understand the code better.

### --feedback--

Sarah does not ask for help in understanding the code; she merely explains her current situation with the code and where the problem lies.
