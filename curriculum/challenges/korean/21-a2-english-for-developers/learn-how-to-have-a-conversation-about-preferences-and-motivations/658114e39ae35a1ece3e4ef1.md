<!-- (Audio) Maria: Hi Brian! Well, one thing that really motivates me is learning new things. -->

# --description--

Listen to the audio and answer the question.

# --question--

## --text--

What motivates Maria?

## --answers--

learned new things

### --feedback--

This option uses the past tense, which talks about things Maria has already learned, not what currently motivates her.

---

learning old things

### --feedback--

This option uses `old`, which is the opposite of what Maria finds motivating.

---

learning new thing

### --feedback--

This option is missing the plural `s` at the end of `thing`, which changes the meaning from many things to just one.

---

learning new things
