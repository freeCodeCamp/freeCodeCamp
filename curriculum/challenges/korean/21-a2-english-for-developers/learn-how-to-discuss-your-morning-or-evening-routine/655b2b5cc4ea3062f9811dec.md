# --description--
A `night owl` is someone who stays up late. For example: `He's a night owl, often working past midnight` (stays up late)

`Hang out` means to spend time relaxing or socializing. For example: `We hang out at the park on weekends` (spending leisure time)

`Be back` means to return, and `tops` is used informally to indicate the maximum amount or time. 예:
