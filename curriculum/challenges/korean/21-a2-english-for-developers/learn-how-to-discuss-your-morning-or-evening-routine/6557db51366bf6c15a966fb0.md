# --description--

When a verb follows a preposition, it often takes the `-ing` form, known as a gerund. Gerunds are verbs acting as nouns. This rule is common in many English expressions. 예시:

`After eating dinner, we watched a movie.` (`eating` follows the preposition `after`)

`She is interested in learning Spanish.` (`learning` follows the preposition `in`)

`Before going to bed, I like to read.` (`going` follows the preposition `before`)


# --question--

## --text--

What is the verb Sarah uses after the preposition `before`?

## --answers--

`morning`

### --feedback--

`Morning` is a noun and doesn't fit after `before` in the context of an action related to leaving.

---

`leave`

### --feedback--

`Leave` is the base form of the verb, but after a preposition, the verb should be in the `-ing` form.

---

`leaving`

---

`left`

### --feedback--

`Left` is the past tense of `leave` and isn't used after a preposition to describe an ongoing action.
