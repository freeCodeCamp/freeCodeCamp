Bob: I'm questioning if our current practices are robust enough to protect sensitive information.

# --description--

`Robust` means strong or powerful. 예시:

`A robust system can handle many users.`

`Enough` means as much as is necessary. 예:

`Do we have enough chairs?`

Together, `robust enough` means being strong or effective to the necessary degree. For example, this sentence asks if the password is strong enough to stop hackers:

`Is the password robust enough to prevent hacking?`
