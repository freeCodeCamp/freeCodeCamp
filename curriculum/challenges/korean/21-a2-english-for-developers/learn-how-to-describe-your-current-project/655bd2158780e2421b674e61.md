# --description--

`Data` means information, especially facts or numbers collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.

There are different types of data, like `quantitative data`, which is about numbers (like how many people visit a store), and `qualitative data`, which is about descriptions (like what people think about a product).

`Customer data` is specific information about customers, like their buying habits or preferences.

For example, a store might collect data on what times of day customers visit most often, or which products are most popular.
