<!-- (Audio) Sarah: They're useful for studying things like molecules and drugs. -->

# --description--

When you say something is `useful`, you mean it can help you to perform a certain task or activity. Example: `Computers are very useful for calculating things.` As you can see, after `useful`, we have the preposition `for`, meaning any verb that comes after it has to be in the `-ing` form (see the example).

`Molecules` are like tiny building blocks that make up everything. Everything you see and touch is made from molecules. They are groups of two or more atoms together.

`Drugs` are substances that change how our bodies feel or work. There are two kinds: medicine and illegal drugs. People can take drugs as pills, liquids, or in other ways.

Fill in the blanks with the correct word from the dialogue.
