<!-- (Audio) Tom: If you see her today, she's wearing a black and green jacket and a beige shirt. -->

# --description--

When talking about a person's clothes, it is common to refer to them by mentioning their size and color. Let's take a look at some colors in this challenge.

`Beige` is a color similar that of sand on a tropical beach or a very light brown paper.

`Black` is the darkest color. It looks like the sky at night when it's very dark and there are no lights. You can also hear people refer to `black` as the absence of colors. It is the opposite of `white`, which is referred to as the combination of all colors.

`Green` is the color of many plants and leaves. It looks like the color of grass in a park or the leaves on trees.

Listen to the audio and fill in the blanks.
