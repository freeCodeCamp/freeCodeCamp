<!-- (Audio) Bob: I think there was a mix-up. Maria: Oh really? I thought it was all okay. What happened? -->

# --description--

The verb `to think`, in English, is irregular. Different from other, regular verbs, which get `-ed` added to them to form the past, when you want to use the verb `think` in the past, you use the word `thought`. Example: `I thought you were out of town`, meaning you imagined that the other person traveled to some other place.

The question `What happened?` indicates you are asking someone to explain an event or situation. For example, if you see someone looking upset, you might ask, `What happened?` to understand why they are upset. It means you want to know what made the other person upset. If you see someone with an arm or a leg in a cast, you can ask `What happened?` to understand how the person got hurt.

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
