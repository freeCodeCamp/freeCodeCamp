<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Alice. How was it for you to get into tech?
Alice: My background is a bit unconventional. -->

# --description--

The word `unconventional` is used to describe something that's not based on or conforming to what is generally done or believed. It often implies a method or approach that is different from the norm.

# --question--

## --text--

What does `unconventional` imply about Alice's background in tech?

## --answers--

Her background is different from the usual way people get into tech

---

Her background is exactly the same as most people in tech

### --feedback--

`Unconventional` means not following the usual conventions, which contradicts being the same as most people.

---

She doesn't have any background in tech

### --feedback--

`Unconventional` suggests a different approach, not the absence of a background.

---

She followed a very traditional path into tech

### --feedback--

`Unconventional` indicates a non-traditional path, not a very traditional one.
