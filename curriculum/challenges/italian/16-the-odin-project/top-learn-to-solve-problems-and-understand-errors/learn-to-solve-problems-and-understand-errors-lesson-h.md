# --description--

At this point, you might be wondering how you can resolve these errors.

1. You can start by understanding that the error message is your friend - not your enemy. Error messages tell you exactly what is wrong with your code, and which lines to examine to find the source of the error. Without error messages it would be a nightmare to debug our code - because it would still not work, you just wouldn’t know why!

1. You shoud search your error on the web, most of the time you will be able to find a fix or explanation on StackOverflow or in the documentation. If nothing else, you will receive more clarity as to why you are receiving this error.

1. Another way is to use `console.log()` — it is a popular choice for quick debugging. For more involved troubleshooting, using the debugger might be more appropriate, but using `console.log()` is great for getting immediate feedback without needing to step through your functions. There are also other useful methods such as `console.table()`, `console.trace()`, and more!
