<!-- (Audio) James: Sarah, have you heard about Quantum Computing? I just heard about it for the first time. -->

# --description--

Sometimes, it is possible that a verb in the Simple Past and in the Present Perfect are conjugated the same way. In this dialogue, James asks if Sarah `has heard` about Quantum Computing and then says he just `heard` about it. The participle form of `hear` is `heard`, just like the past form of `hear` is `heard` as well. Examples: `On Monday, I heard you were coming to visit.` (someone told me this on Monday). `I have heard about the situation before.` (there is no reference as to when). In both cases, `heard` is used. James says he `just heard` about Quantum Computing, meaning it happened a short time ago, probably minutes before the conversation. `Just` is used here to express that something happened a bit before the moment the conversation is happening. Example: `I just saw him crossing the street.`

Listen to the dialogue and fill in the blanks.
