# --description--

`Guidelines` are instructions or rules that indicate how something should be done. For instance, `coding guidelines` help programmers understand how to write code for a project. `Consistency` means keeping things the same or uniform, especially in quality. In a work context, `ensuring consistency` might mean making sure that all parts of a project follow the same standards.
