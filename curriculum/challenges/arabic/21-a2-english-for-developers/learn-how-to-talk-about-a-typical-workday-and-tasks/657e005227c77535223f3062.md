<!-- (audio) Tom: Hey Brian, let me ask you about your daily routine as a web developer. What's your typical workday like? -->

# --description--

When talking about a typical day, especially in a professional context, we often use the present simple tense to describe regular activities or routines. Words like `routine`, `typical`, and `workday` are commonly used in this context.

- `Routine` refers to the regular way of doing things in a particular order. For example, `My morning routine includes jogging and reading the news.`
- `Typical` means what is normal or usual. For example, `A typical day at work involves meetings and writing reports.`
- `Workday` refers to the day or hours during which you work. For example, `My workday starts at 9 AM and ends at 5 PM.`
