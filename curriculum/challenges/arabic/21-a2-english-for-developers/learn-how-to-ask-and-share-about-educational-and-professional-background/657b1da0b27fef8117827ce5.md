<!-- (Audio) Brian: Hey, how's it going? I noticed you're relatively new here. What's your background in tech? -->

# --description--

You've already learned about the simple past tense. Now, you can explore it further. The simple past tense is often formed by adding `-ed` to a verb. But, when a verb ends with an `e`, you just add a `d`. For example, `notice` becomes `noticed`.

# --question--

## --text--

What does `noticed` in Brian's sentence indicate?

## --answers--

Brian observed something in the past

---

Brian is planning to observe something

### --feedback--

The simple past tense `noticed` indicates a completed action in the past, not a future plan.

---

Brian continuously observes something

### --feedback--

The simple past tense `noticed` is used for actions that were completed, not ongoing actions.

---

Brian never observes anything

### --feedback--

`Noticed` implies that Brian did observe something, not never observing.
