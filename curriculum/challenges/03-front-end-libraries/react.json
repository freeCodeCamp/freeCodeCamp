        "<strong>Intro:</strong> React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.",
        "React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. This has several benefits. It lets you use the full programmatic power of JavaScript within HTML, and helps to keep your code readable. For the most part, JSX is similar to the HTML that you have already learned, however there are a few key differences that will be covered throughout these challenges.",
        "For instance, because JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript, you can actually write JavaScript directly within JSX. To do this, you simply include the code you want to be treated as JavaScript within curly braces: <code>{ 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }</code>. Keep this in mind, since it's used in several future challenges.",
        "However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process. For your convenience, it's already added behind the scenes for these challenges. If you happen to write syntactically invalid JSX, you will see the first test in these challenges fail.",
        "It's worth noting that under the hood the challenges are calling <code>ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))</code>. This function call is what places your JSX into React's own lightweight representation of the DOM. React then uses snapshots of its own DOM to optimize updating only specific parts of the actual DOM.",

        "<strong>Instructions:</strong> The current code uses JSX to assign a <code>div</code> element to the constant <code>JSX</code>. Replace the <code>div</code> with an <code>h1</code> element and add the text <code>Hello JSX!</code> inside it."

        "In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag: <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.",

        "In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed. The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, on the other hand, can be written as <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>.

With this foundation, it's time to look at another feature very common in React: <b>props</b>. In React, you can pass props, or properties, to child components. Say you have an <code>App</code> component which renders a child component called <code>Welcome</code> that is a stateless functional component. You can pass <code>Welcome</code> a <code>user</code> property by writing:",
        "<blockquote>&lt;App&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Welcome user='Mark' /&gt;<br>&lt;/App&gt;</blockquote>",

For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set <code>propTypes</code> on your component to require the data to be of type <code>array</code>. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.",

You can define a <code>propTypes</code> property for a component in the same way you defined <code>defaultProps</code>. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type <code>function</code> for a prop called <code>handleClick</code>:",

Also notice that <code>func</code> represents <code>function</code>. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, <code>function</code> and <code>boolean</code> (written as <code>bool</code>) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element. Please refer to the documentation for all of the options.",

React provides a method for updating component <code>state</code> called <code>setState</code>. You call the <code>setState</code> method within your component class like so: <code>this.setState()</code>, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a <code>username</code> in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:",

Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the <code>setState</code> method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the <code>setState</code> method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind!

      "description": [
        "You saw a lot of examples that passed props to child JSX elements and child React components in previous challenges. You may be wondering where those props come from. A common pattern is to have a stateful component containing the <code>state</code> important to your app, that then renders child components. You want these components to have access to some pieces of that <code>state</code>, which are passed in as props.",
        "For example, maybe you have an <code>App</code> component that renders a <code>Navbar</code>, among other components. In your <code>App</code>, you have <code>state</code> that contains a lot of user information, but the <code>Navbar</code> only needs access to the user's username so it can display it. You pass that piece of <code>state</code> to the <code>Navbar</code> component as a prop.",
        "This pattern illustrates some important paradigms in React. The first is <em>unidirectional data flow</em>. State flows in one direction down the tree of your application's components, from the stateful parent component to child components. The child components only receive the state data they need. The second is that complex stateful apps can be broken down into just a few, or maybe a single, stateful component. The rest of your components simply receive state from the parent as props, and render a UI from that state. It begins to create a separation where state management is handled in one part of code and UI rendering in another. This principle of separating state logic from UI logic is one of React's key principles. When it's used correctly, it makes the design of complex, stateful applications much easier to manage.",
        "<hr>",

Pass the <code>name</code> property in its <code>state</code> down to the child component, then show the <code>name</code> in the <code>h1</code> tag that's part of the <code>Navbar</code> render method."

For example, the default behavior is that your component re-renders when it receives new <code>props</code>, even if the <code>props</code> haven't changed. You can use <code>shouldComponentUpdate()</code> to prevent this by comparing the <code>props</code>. The method must return a <code>boolean</code> value that tells React whether or not to update the component. You can compare the current props (<code>this.props</code>) to the next props (<code>nextProps</code>) to determine if you need to update or not, and return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> accordingly.",

Currently, this method returns <code>true</code> so <code>OnlyEvens</code> re-renders every time it receives new <code>props</code>. Modify the method so <code>OnlyEvens</code> updates only if the <code>value</code> of its new props is even.

        "The if/else statements worked in the last challenge, but there's a more concise way to achieve the same result. Imagine that you are tracking several conditions in a component and you want different elements to render depending on each of these conditions. If you write a lot of <code>else if</code> statements to return slightly different UIs, you may repeat code which leaves room for error. Instead, you can use the <code>&&</code> logical operator to perform conditional logic in a more concise way. This is possible because you want to check if a condition is <code>true</code>, and if it is, return some markup. Here's an example:",
        "<code>{condition && &lt;p&gt;markup&lt;/p&gt;}</code>",
        "If the <code>condition</code> is <code>true</code>, the markup will be returned. If the condition is <code>false</code>, the operation will immediately return <code>false</code> after evaluating the <code>condition</code> and return nothing. You can include these statements directly in your JSX and string multiple conditions together by writing <code>&&</code> after each one. This allows you to handle more complex conditional logic in your <code>render()</code> method without repeating a lot of code.",

      "description": [
        "Before moving on to dynamic rendering techniques, there's one last way to use built-in JavaScript conditionals to render what you want: the <em><strong>ternary operator</strong></em>. The ternary operator is often utilized as a shortcut for <code>if/else</code> statements in JavaScript. They're not quite as robust as traditional <code>if/else</code> statements, but they are very popular among React developers. One reason for this is because of how JSX is compiled, <code>if/else</code> statements can't be inserted directly into JSX code. You might have noticed this a couple challenges ago &mdash; when an <code>if/else</code> statement was required, it was always <em>outside</em> the <code>return</code> statement. Ternary expressions can be an excellent alternative if you want to implement conditional logic within your JSX. Recall that a ternary operator has three parts, but you can combine several ternary expressions together. Here's the basic syntax:",
        "<blockquote>condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse</blockquote>",
        "<hr>",
        "The code editor has three constants defined within the <code>CheckUserAge</code> component's <code>render()</code> method. They are called <code>buttonOne</code>, <code>buttonTwo</code>, and <code>buttonThree</code>. Each of these is assigned a simple JSX expression representing a button element. First, initialize the state of <code>CheckUserAge</code> with <code>input</code> and <code>userAge</code> both set to values of an empty string.",
        "Once the component is rendering information to the page, users should have a way to interact with it. Within the component's <code>return</code> statement, set up a ternary expression that implements the following logic: when the page first loads, render the submit button, <code>buttonOne</code>, to the page. Then, when a user enters their age and clicks the button, render a different button based on the age. If a user enters a number less than <code>18</code>, render <code>buttonThree</code>. If a user enters a number greater than or equal to <code>18</code>, render <code>buttonTwo</code>."

      "description": [
        "So far, you've seen how to use <code>if/else</code>, <code>&&,</code> <code>null</code> and the ternary operator (<code>condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse</code>) to make conditional decisions about what to render and when. However, there's one important topic left to discuss that lets you combine any or all of these concepts with another powerful React feature: props. Using props to conditionally render code is very common with React developers &mdash; that is, they use the value of a given prop to automatically make decisions about what to render.",
        "In this challenge, you'll set up a child component to make rendering decisions based on props. You'll also use the ternary operator, but you can see how several of the other concepts that were covered in the last few challenges might be just as useful in this context.",
        "<hr>",
        "The code editor has two components that are partially defined for you: a parent called <code>GameOfChance</code>, and a child called <code>Results</code>. They are used to create a simple game where the user presses a button to see if they win or lose.",
        "First, you'll need a simple expression that randomly returns a different value every time it is run. You can use <code>Math.random()</code>. This method returns a value between <code>0</code> (inclusive) and <code>1</code> (exclusive) each time it is called. So for 50/50 odds, use <code>Math.random() > .5</code> in your expression. Statistically speaking, this expression will return <code>true</code> 50% of the time, and <code>false</code> the other 50%. On line 30, replace the comment with this expression to complete the variable declaration.",
        "Now you have an expression that you can use to make a randomized decision in the code. Next you need to implement this. Render the <code>Results</code> component as a child of <code>GameOfChance</code>, and pass in <code>expression</code> as a prop called <code>fiftyFifty</code>. In the <code>Results</code> component, write a ternary expression to render the text <code>\"You win!\"</code> or <code>\"You lose!\"</code> based on the <code>fiftyFifty</code> prop that's being passed in from <code>GameOfChance</code>. Finally, make sure the <code>handleClick()</code> method is correctly counting each turn so the user knows how many times they've played. This also serves to let the user know the component has actually updated in case they win or lose twice in a row."

      "description": [
        "At this point, you've seen several applications of conditional rendering and the use of inline styles. Here's one more example that combines both of these topics. You can also render CSS conditionally based on the state of a React component. To do this, you check for a condition, and if that condition is met, you modify the styles object that's assigned to the JSX elements in the render method.",
        "This paradigm is important to understand because it is a dramatic shift from the more traditional approach of applying styles by modifying DOM elements directly (which is very common with jQuery, for example). In that approach, you must keep track of when elements change and also handle the actual manipulation directly. It can become difficult to keep track of changes, potentially making your UI unpredictable. When you set a style object based on a condition, you describe how the UI should look as a function of the application's state. There is a clear flow of information that only moves in one direction. This is the preferred method when writing applications with React.",
        "<hr>",
        "The code editor has a simple controlled input component with a styled border. You want to style this border red if the user types more than 15 characters of text in the input box. Add a condition to check for this and, if the condition is valid, set the input border style to <code>3px solid red</code>. You can try it out by entering text in the input."

        "The <code>map</code> array method is a powerful tool that you will use often when working with React. Another method related to <code>map</code> is <code>filter</code>, which filters the contents of an array based on a condition, then returns a new array. For example, if you have an array of users that all have a property <code>online</code> which can be set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, you can filter only those users that are online by writing:",

        "In the code editor, <code>MyComponent</code>&apos;s <code>state</code> is initialized with an array of users. Some users are online and some aren't. Filter the array so you see only the users who are online. To do this, first use <code>filter</code> to return a new array containing only the users whose <code>online</code> property is <code>true</code>. Then, in the <code>renderOnline</code> variable, map over the filtered array, and return a <code>li</code> element for each user that contains the text of their <code>username</code>. Be sure to include a unique <code>key</code> as well, like in the last challenges."

        "So far, you have been rendering React components on the client. Normally, this is what you will always do. However, there are some use cases where it makes sense to render a React component on the server. Since React is a JavaScript view library and you can run JavaScript on the server with Node, this is possible. In fact, React provides a <code>renderToString()</code> method you can use for this purpose.",
        "There are two key reasons why rendering on the server may be used in a real world app. First, without doing this, your React apps would consist of a relatively empty HTML file and a large bundle of JavaScript when it's initially loaded to the browser. This may not be ideal for search engines that are trying to index the content of your pages so people can find you. If you render the initial HTML markup on the server and send this to the client, the initial page load contains all of the page's markup which can be crawled by search engines. Second, this creates a faster initial page load experience because the rendered HTML is smaller than the JavaScript code of the entire app. React will still be able to recognize your app and manage it after the initial load.",
