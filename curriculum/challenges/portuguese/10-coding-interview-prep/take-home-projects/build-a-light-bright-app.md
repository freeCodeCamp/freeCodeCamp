**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io) app that is functionally similar to this: <https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/eyLYXE>.

**Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2:** Fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story:** I can click or drag the mouse cursor to color the circles.

**User Story:** I can double-click on a colored circle to remove the color.

**User Story:** I can click on a colored circle to change its color.

**User Story:** I should get a circle of different color on each click.

**User Story:** I can click on the 'Reset' button to remove the recent color.

**User Story:** I can click on the 'Reset All' button to remove all the colors from the circles.

When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the [freeCodeCamp forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409).
