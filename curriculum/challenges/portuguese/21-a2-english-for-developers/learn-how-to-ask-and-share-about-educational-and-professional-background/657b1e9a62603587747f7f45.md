# --description--

In English, when forming questions in the simple past tense, you often use `did`. This is followed by the subject and the base form of the verb (without `ed`). For example, `Did you enjoy` is a past simple interrogative phrase where `did` is the auxiliary verb, `you` is the subject, and `enjoy` is the base form of the verb.
