# --description--

In English, `he` is a pronoun used to refer to a male person. Pronouns are useful to avoid repetition and make sentences clearer.

Notice this part of the dialogue:

`Tom, this is Brian. He's a web developer. Brian, this is Tom. He's our new graphic designer and he is from Texas.`

In the dialogue, after introducing Brian, Sophie uses `he` to talk about Brian's job. Later, she uses `he` again to talk about Tom and his job.

By using `he`, Sophie doesn't have to repeat the names `Brian` and `Tom`. This is the power of the pronouns.
