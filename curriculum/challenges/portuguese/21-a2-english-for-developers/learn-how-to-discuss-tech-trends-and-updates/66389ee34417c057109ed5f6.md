<!-- (Audio) Sarah: It's one of those trends that automates certain tasks in development. -->

# --description--

To `automate` means to make a process operate by itself without needing a person to help. In programming, it might involve using software to write code, test applications, or find and fix errors. For example, a coffee machine that turns on by itself in the morning to make coffee is `automated`.

The word `certain` is used to talk about specific things or people, but not all things or people. For instance, if you say `certain books are on sale`, it means only some books are on sale, not all of them.
