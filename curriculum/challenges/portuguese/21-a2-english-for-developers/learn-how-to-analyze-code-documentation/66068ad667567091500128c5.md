AUDIO REFERENCE:
Sophie: This library has so many functions. How can I effectively analyze the documentation for them?

# --description--

A `library` is like a big bookshelf with lots of code that programmers can use. Think of it like a cookbook with many recipes (functions) you can use to cook (program) different dishes (projects).

For example, a `library` in programming might have a function to make charts. Instead of writing code from scratch, you can use this function, like following a recipe to make a cake.
