<!--
AUDIO REFERENCE:
Sophie: I think we’re going to focus on social media marketing. It's cost-effective, and it will reach a broader audience.
Brian: That sounds good. I suggest that we also invest in email marketing. It's more targeted, and it will allow us to engage with our subscribers directly.

`Instead of` is a phrase used to suggest an alternative to something else.

For example, `Instead of using traditional advertising, let's try digital campaigns.` It implies replacing one option with another.

# --question--

## --text--

Is Brian suggesting investing in email marketing instead of focusing on social media marketing?

## --answers--

Yes, he is proposing email marketing as a replacement for social media marketing.

### --feedback--

This choice is incorrect. Brian uses `also` in his statement, indicating an addition, not a replacement.

---

No, he is suggesting it as an additional strategy alongside social media marketing.

---

Yes, because email marketing is more cost-effective than social media marketing.

### --feedback--

The cost-effectiveness isn't the basis for an alternative choice; Brian is adding to, not replacing, the social media strategy.

---

No, because he thinks social media marketing is ineffective.

### --feedback--

Brian's suggestion does not imply that he finds social media marketing ineffective; rather, he's proposing an additional strategy.
