AUDIO REFERENCE:
Sarah: Hey, James! Thanks. Look, I don't do anything out of the ordinary, I think. I usually wake up around 7 AM. The first thing I do is stretch a bit to wake up. Then, I go straight to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. It's my morning fuel!

# --description--

The word `fuel` typically refers to a substance that is used to produce energy, like gasoline for cars or coal for trains. However, in everyday language, people often use `fuel` to describe something that gives them energy or motivation.

For example, someone might call food or drink their `fuel` if it helps them to start the day with energy.
