<!-- (Audio) Sophie: How does it work exactly? Tom: AR apps use your device's camera to add digital content to the physical world. It's so cool. -->

# --description--

When you add `'s` after a noun, it shows that something belongs to or is connected to that noun. It's like adding a label to say that this thing belongs to this person or object. `'s` indicates the ownership or possession.

Examples: `This is Tom's camera.` (this camera belongs to Tom). `That's today's newspaper.` (that newspaper has the news for today).

# --question--

## --text--

In the dialogue, what does Tom mean when he says `AR apps use your device's camera`?

## --answers--

That the camera belongs to your friend.

### --feedback--

Adding `'s` doesn't indicate that the camera belongs to a person necessarily.

---

That it is the camera on your device.

---

That the camera belongs to Tom.

### --feedback--

`'s` can be used to show possession, but not in this context.

---

That the camera belongs to Sophie.

### --feedback--

Sophie is not mentioned as the owner of the camera in this context. Think about the device mentioned.
