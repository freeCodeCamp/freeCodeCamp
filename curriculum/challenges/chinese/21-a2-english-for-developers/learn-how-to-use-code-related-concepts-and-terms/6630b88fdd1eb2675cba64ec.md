# --description--

Prepositions are words that link nouns, pronouns, or phrases to other words within a sentence and often indicate time, place, or relationship, like `with`, `for`, `about`. They can also appear at the end of a question or sentence, which is common in spoken English.

Examples:

When someone asks `who are you going with?` the preposition `with` is used at the end to inquire about the company one will have.

`What are you excited about?` In this question, `about` is used at the end to inquire regarding the subject or event that is causing excitement.

`Who are you waiting for?` Here, `for` is placed at the end of the question to ask about the person for whom someone is waiting.

# --question--

## --text--

Which sentence correctly uses a preposition at the end?

## --answers--

`What are you speaking of?`

### --feedback--

While `of` is a preposition, this sentence sounds a bit awkward or formal. It would be more natural to ask, `What are you talking about?`

---

`What are you looking for?`

---

`Where is it belong?`

### --feedback--

The correct sentence should be `Where does it belong?` without the preposition at the end, as `belong` does not typically require a preposition.

---

`Who do you want to meet with she?`

### --feedback--

The correct form should be `Who do you want to meet with?` `With she` is grammatically incorrect; it should be `with her`.
