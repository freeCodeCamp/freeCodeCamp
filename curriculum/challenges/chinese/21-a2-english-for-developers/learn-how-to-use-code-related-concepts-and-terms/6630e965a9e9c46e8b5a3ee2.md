# --description--

In programming, `int` stands for "integer". It's a data type used to store whole numbers, which are numbers without fractional parts or decimals. Integers can be positive, negative, or zero.

Choosing the `int` data type is essential when dealing with whole numbers, like counts, indexes in arrays, or any scenario where fractional numbers are not needed.

Examples:

Counting items: `int itemCount = 5;`

Storing age: `int age = 30;`
