# --description--

`Clarify` means to make something clear or easier to understand. For instance, you might `clarify` a complex idea by explaining it in simpler terms.

`Functions` in programming are sets of instructions that perform a specific task.

A `variable` is like a box where you can store information or data in a computer program. You can change what's inside the box, or `variable`, as your program runs. It's a way to keep track of and use data in your code.

Examples:

`He clarified the instructions by providing a step-by-step guide.`

`The "calculateTotal" function adds up all the prices.`

`The variable "score" keeps track of the player's points.`
