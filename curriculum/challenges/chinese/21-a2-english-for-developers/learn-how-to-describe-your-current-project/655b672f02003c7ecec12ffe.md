<!-- (Audio) James: I'm using special tools to see where we might have problems, and then I have to fix them. -->

# --description--

Let's practice conditionals!

# --question--

## --text--

What will James do if he finds problems?

## --answers--

If he finds problems, he will take a break

### --feedback--

This option doesn't align with the proactive approach James mentions.

---

If he finds problems, he will report them

### --feedback--

That's a good idea, but it's not what he says.

---

If he finds problems, he will fix them

---

If he finds problems, he will ignore them

### --feedback--

Ignoring problems contradicts the proactive and responsible approach discussed.
