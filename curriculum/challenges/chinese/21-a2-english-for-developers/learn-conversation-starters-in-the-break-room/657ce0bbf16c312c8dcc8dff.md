# --description--

There are some words you can use in your sentence to express how often something happens. They are called `adverbs of frequency`.

`Usually` is a word that suggests that something happens more often than not but is not constant.

When `usually` is used with the verb `to be,` it is placed after the verb. `She is usually on time for meetings.`

With other verbs, `usually` comes before the main verb, for example: `He usually works late.`
