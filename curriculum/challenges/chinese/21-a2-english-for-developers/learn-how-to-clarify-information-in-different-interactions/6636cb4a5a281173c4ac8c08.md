<!-- (Audio) Delivery Man: Hi there. I have a package for Tom. Do you know him? -->

# --description--

A `package` is a box or a bag that contains items. People use packages to send or receive things in the mail or to store items together. When you buy something at an online store, for instance, you normally receive that `package` back at home some time later.
