<!-- (Audio) Tom: Hey, Alice. Do you know Lisa? Alice: No, I don't think I've had the chance to meet her. Who's Lisa? -->

# --description--

When you say `I don't think I've had the chance`, you're expressing that you haven't had the opportunity or occasion to do something. It means you haven't had the possibility to experience a particular event or meet someone before. The full form of the phrase is `I do not think I have had the chance`. Example: `I don't think I've had the chance to visit the museum.` (you did not go to the museum or, at least, you don't remember having gone there).
