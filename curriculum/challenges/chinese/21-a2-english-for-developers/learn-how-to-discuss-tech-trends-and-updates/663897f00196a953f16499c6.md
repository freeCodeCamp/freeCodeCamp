# --description--

The word `any` is often used in questions and negative sentences to indicate an indefinite amount or number. It helps indicate that the quantity or existence is uncertain or general.

Examples:

`Do you have any questions?` - `Any` is used in a question to ask if there are questions, even one.

`I don't have any money.` - In this negative sentence, `any` shows that the speaker has zero money.

Understanding how to use `any` correctly is important for forming clear and accurate questions and negative statements. On the other hand, `some` is often used in affirmative statements to indicate an unspecified amount or number.
