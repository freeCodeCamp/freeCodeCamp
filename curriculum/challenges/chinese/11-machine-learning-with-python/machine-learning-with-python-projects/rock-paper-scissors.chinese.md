## Description
<section id='description'>
For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

You can access <a href='https://repl.it/@freeCodeCamp/fcc-rock-paper-scissors' target='_blank'>the full project description and starter code on repl.it</a>.

After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in 'README.md', submit your project link below.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the machine learning curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.
