What is a map method and how does it work?

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The map method is a powerful and widely used function in JavaScript that operates on arrays.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It's designed to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This method does not modify the original array, but instead returns a new array.

5
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The new array contains the results of the function applied to each element.
