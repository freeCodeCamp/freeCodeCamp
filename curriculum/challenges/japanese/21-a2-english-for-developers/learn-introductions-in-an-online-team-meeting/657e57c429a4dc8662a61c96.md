# --description--

`Specific` means something very clear and exact. For example, `The client has specific goals for the project` means the client's goals are clear.

`Requirements` are things that are needed. Like when you have a list of things you must do for a project. For example, `The project has several key requirements` refers to essential tasks or conditions for the project.

`Specific requirements` means very clear and exact things you need to do. Like a list that tells you exactly what to do for a project. It combines the clarity of `specific` with the needs of `requirements`. Like saying, `We need to meet the specific requirements of the client` which means meeting the precise needs or conditions the client has set.
