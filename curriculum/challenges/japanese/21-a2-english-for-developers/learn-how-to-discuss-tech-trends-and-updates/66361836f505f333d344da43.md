<!-- (Audio) Brian: I see. Maybe we could try it on some of our more demanding projects. -->

# --description--

The phrase `maybe we could try it` is a polite way to suggest an action. `Maybe` introduces the suggestion. The modal verb `could` is used here to express possibility or potential, implying that the action is not certain but is one option to consider.

For example, saying `Maybe we could go to the cinema tonight` suggests that going to the cinema is one possibility among others, depending on other factors like availability or interest.
