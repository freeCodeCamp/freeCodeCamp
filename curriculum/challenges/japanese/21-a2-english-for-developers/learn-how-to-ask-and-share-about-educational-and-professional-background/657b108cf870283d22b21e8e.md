# --description--

In English, the simple present tense is used to describe habitual or usual actions. However, when you are talking about past roles or experiences, like in an interview, you should use the simple past tense.

The simple past tense often involves changing verbs. For example, `is` becomes `was` for singular subjects and `are` becomes `were` for plural subjects.

For example, `I am a teacher` in the present becomes `I was a teacher` for past experiences. Similarly, `They are engineers` changes to `They were engineers` when speaking about the past.
