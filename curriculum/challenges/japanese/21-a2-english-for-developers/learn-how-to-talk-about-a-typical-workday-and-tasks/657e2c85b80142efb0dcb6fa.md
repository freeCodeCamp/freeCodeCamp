<!-- (audio) Anna: You have a one-hour lunch break around noon every day. -->


# --description--

`Before` is used to talk about a time earlier than another event or time. It indicates that something happens first. For example, `I eat breakfast before I go to work` means that eating breakfast happens earlier in time than going to work.

`After` is used to describe something that happens later than another event or time. It indicates the sequence of events where something happens following something else. For example, `I go home after work` means that going home happens later in time than finishing work.

`Around` is used with time expressions indicates a time close to but not exactly at that point. It suggests flexibility within a short time frame. For example, `We'll meet around noon` can mean any time close to 12:00 PM, like 11:45 AM or 12:15 PM. It's commonly used to give a general idea of timing without being too specific.
