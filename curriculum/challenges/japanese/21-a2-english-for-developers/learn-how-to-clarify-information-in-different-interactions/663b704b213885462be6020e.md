<!-- (Audio) Sophie: Does that help? Delivery Man: Absolutely. Thanks for the description. -->

# --description--

`Absolutely` means completely or 100%. You use it to show you agree very strongly or to say something is very true. For example, if someone asks `Do you want some ice cream?` and you really do, you can say, `Absolutely!`

# --question--

## --text--

Did Sophie's description of Tom help the Delivery Man?

## --answers--

Yes, he says it helped him

---

Not really. He asks for more details

### --feedback--

He doesn't. He uses `Absolutely` to say he agrees she helped him a lot.

---

No, it didn't. He looks confused based on his answer

### --feedback--

As he answers `Absolutely`, it seems he's ok with the description.

---

Yes, but he still needs to know more about Tom

He doesn't ask for more details. He simply agrees that the description helped him.
