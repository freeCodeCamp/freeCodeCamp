<!-- (Audio) Maria: And what about the budget allocation? -->

# --description--

A `budget` is a plan that shows how much money you have and how you will spend it. For example, if you have $100, your `budget` will show what you will buy with that money and how much each thing costs.

`Budget allocation` means deciding how to divide and use the money in your `budget`. For example, if you have $100 and you decide to spend $50 on food and $50 on clothes, that is your `budget allocation`. It means choosing how to use your money for different things.

Listen to Maria and fill in the blanks.
