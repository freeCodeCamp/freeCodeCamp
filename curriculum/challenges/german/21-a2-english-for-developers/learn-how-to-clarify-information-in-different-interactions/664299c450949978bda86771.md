<!-- (Audio) Bob: I just wanted to make sure everyone has enough choices. -->

# --description--

When using words like `everybody` or `everyone`, which mean all the people in a group, we treat them as if they are one person. This is why we use 3rd person singular verbs with them. For example, you say, `Everybody IS here` (instead of `are`) or `Everyone LIKES ice cream` (instead of `like`). Even though these words refer to many people, the verb form used is the same as for one person, like `he` or `she`.

Listen to Bob and fill in the blank.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`I just wanted to make sure everyone _ enough choices.`

## --blanks--

`has`

### --feedback--

The verb `have`, but remember that you should use the 3rd person singular form with `everyone`.
