What potential problem is Brian mentioning?

## --answers--

Changing the logic might cause issues in other parts of the system.

The logic modification will definitely improve the system.

### --feedback--

Brian is cautioning about potential issues, not guaranteeing improvements.

---

Other parts of the system do not affect the logic.

### --feedback--

Brian's focus is on the impact of the logic change on other parts, not the other way around.
