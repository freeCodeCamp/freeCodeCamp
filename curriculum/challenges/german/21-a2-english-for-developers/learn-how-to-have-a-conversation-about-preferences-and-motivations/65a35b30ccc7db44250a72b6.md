# --description--

A `field` refers to an area of study or work, like technology, medicine, or education. For example, `I work in the tech field,` means you work in technology.

`To achieve` means to successfully reach a goal through effort. Like when you complete a project, you might say, `I achieved my goal of building an app.`

Lisa is comparing the tech industry to other work areas, noting that it's harder in other areas to find the same kind of stability.
