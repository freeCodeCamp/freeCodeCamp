<!-- (Audio) Sarah: I know a little. Quantum Computing uses special computers to perform calculations extremely quickly. -->

# --description--

Normally, what differentiates an adjective from an adverb is the suffix `-ly` in the end, added to an adjective to create an adverb. Examples: `extreme` (adjective) x `extremely` (adverb) / `quick` (adjective) x `quickly` (adverb).

Also, know that it is possible to use an adverb like `extremely` to intensify an adjective or even another adverb. If you say that something happens `quickly`, it is a fast action. If it is `extremely quickly`, the action is super fast.

Fill in the blanks according to what Sarah says in the dialogue.
