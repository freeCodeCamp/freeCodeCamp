<!-- (Audio) Sarah: No problem, Tom. To understand them, you can look at their names and comments. Comments explain that function's purpose. -->

# --description--

Please answer the question below.

# --question--

## --text--

How does Sarah suggest Tom should understand the functions?

## --answers--

By memorizing the code of each function

### --feedback--

This is incorrect. Sarah advises looking at the names and comments associated with the functions, not memorizing their code.

---

By looking at their names and comments

---

By asking other programmers

### --feedback--

Sarah does not mention consulting other programmers; she focuses on using the names and comments within the code itself.

---

By rewriting the functions

### --feedback--

Rewriting is not suggested by Sarah. She recommends understanding them through the existing names and comments in the code.
