Erfülle die folgenden User Stories und bestehe alle Tests. Verwende Bibliotheken und APIs deiner Wahl. Gib dem Ganzen deinen persönlichen Stil.

**User Story:** I can see a list of the most recent posts on the freeCodeCamp forum.

**User Story:** For each topic, I can see the title and a list of links to users who have recently posted in it.

**User Story:** I can see the number of replies and views that each topic has had, and a timestamp of when the topic was last active.

**Hint:** To get the 30 most recent forum posts: <https://forum-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/latest>.
