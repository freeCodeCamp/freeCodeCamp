You can combine basic functions in many ways to build more and more complex programs.<br><br>Functional programming follows a few core principles:<br><br><ul><li>Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation</li><br><li>Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data</li><br><li>Functions have minimal side effects in the program</li></ul><br><br>The functional programming software development approach breaks a program into small, testable parts.

      "description": [
        "Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.",
        "In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.",
        "Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a <code>for</code> loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.",
        "In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.",
        "JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the <code>for</code> loop mentioned above, you could call the <code>map</code> method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the \"Off By One Errors\" that were covered in the Debugging section.",
        "Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.",
        "A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.",
        "The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for <code>tabOpen()</code>, <code>tabClose()</code>, and <code>join()</code>. The array <code>tabs</code> is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.",

You may need to create other variables, but save the final average into the variable <code>averageRating</code>.
