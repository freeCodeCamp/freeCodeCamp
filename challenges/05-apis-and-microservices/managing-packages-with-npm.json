This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the <code>package.json</code> file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.<br><br>npm saves packages in a folder named <code>node_modules</code>. These packages can be installed in two ways:<br><br><ol><li>globally in a root <code>node_modules</code> folder, accessible by all projects.</li><li>locally within a project's own <code>node_modules</code> folder, accessible only to that project.</li></ol><br>Most developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.",
