        "<span class='text-info'>Objective:</span> Get the MEAN stack running on Cloud 9, push your code to GitHub, and deploy it to Heroku.",
        "We'll build our Basejumps on Cloud 9, a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu Linux workspace, all running in the cloud.",

        "Click the \"Create workspace\" button.",
        "Once C9 builds and loads your workspace, you should see a terminal window in the lower right hand corner. In this window use the following commands. You don't need to know what these mean at this point.",
        "Never run this command on your local machine. But in your Cloud 9 terminal window, run: <code>rm -rf * && echo \"export NODE_PATH=$NODE_PATH:/home/ubuntu/.nvm/v0.10.35/lib/node_modules\" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc && npm install -g yo grunt grunt-cli generator-angular-fullstack && yo angular-fullstack</code>",

        "May bower anonymously report usage statistics to improve the tool over time? (Y/n) <span class='text-success'>Y</span>",
        "You may get an error similar to <code> ERR! EEXIST, open ‘/home/ubuntu/.npm</code>. This is caused when Cloud9 runs out of memory and kills an install. If you get this, simply re-run this process with the command <code>yo angular-fullstack</code>. You will then be asked a few questions regarding the re-install. Answer them as follows:",
        "Existing .yo-rc configuration found, would you like to use it? (Y/n) <span class='text-success'>Y</span>",
        "Overwrite client/favicon.ico? (Ynaxdh) <span class='text-success'>Y</span>",

        "Wait for the following message to appear: <code>xdg-open: no method available for opening 'http://localhost:8080' </code>. Now you can open the internal Cloud9 browser. To launch the browser select Preview in the toolbar then select the dropdown option Preview Running Application.",
        "Turn the folder in which your application is running into a Git repository by running the following commands: <code>git init && git add . && git commit -am 'initial commit'</code>.",

        "Now let's push your code to Heroku. If you don't already have a Heroku account, create one at <a href='http://heroku.com' target='_blank'>http://heroku.com</a>. You shouldn't be charged for anything, but you will need to add your credit card information to your Heroku before you will be able to use Heroku's free MongoLab add on.",
        "Before you publish to Heroku, you should free up as much memory as possible on Cloud9. In each of the Cloud9 terminal prompt tabs where MongoDB and Grunt are running, press the <code>control + c</code> hotkey to shut down these processes.",
        "Run the following command in a Cloud9 terminal prompt tab: <code>npm install grunt-contrib-imagemin --save-dev && npm install --save-dev && heroku login</code>. At this point, the terminal will prompt you to log in to Heroku from the command line.",
        "Now run <code>yo angular-fullstack:heroku</code>. You can choose a name for your Heroku project, or Heroku will create a random one for you. You can choose whether you want to deploy to servers the US or the EU.",

        "As you build your app, you should frequently commit changes to your codebase. Make sure you're in the <code>~/workspace</code> directory by running <code>cd ~/workspace</code>. Then you can use this code to stage the changes to your changes and commit them: <code>git commit -am \"your commit message\"</code>.
